A previous trial of concizumab (explorer4) established proof of concept in patients with hemophilia A or B with inhibitors.\nMETHODS: We conducted the explorer7 trial to assess the safety and efficacy of concizumab in patients with hemophilia A or B with inhibitors. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:2 ratio to receive no prophylaxis for at least 24 weeks (group 1) or concizumab prophylaxis for at least 32 weeks (group 2) or were nonrandomly assigned to receive concizumab prophylaxis for at least 24 weeks (groups 3 and 4). After a treatment pause due to nonfatal thromboembolic events in three patients receiving concizumab, including one from the explorer7 trial, concizumab therapy was restarted with a loading dose of 1.0 mg per kilogram of body weight, followed by 0.2 mg per kilogram daily (potentially adjusted on the basis of concizumab plasma concentration as measured at week 4). The primary end-point analysis compared treated spontaneous and traumatic bleeding episodes in group 1 and group 2.

SUMMARY: Background Concizumab is a humanized mAb targeting tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), leading to enhanced thrombin generation (TG) potential. explorer\u21223 (NCT02490787) was a phase 1b, double-blind, multiple-dose escalation trial of subcutaneous concizumab in people with severe hemophilia A without inhibitors. Objectives The primary objective was to evaluate safety. Assessments of pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and subcutaneous concizumab immunogenicity were secondary objectives. Patients/Methods Adverse events (AEs), clinical assessments and bleeding episodes were recorded. Plasma concizumab levels and unbound TFPI levels were measured with ELISAs; residual TFPI activity was measured with a chromogenic assay. Standardized assays were used to assess TG, D-dimer and prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 (F<sub>1 + 2</sub> ) levels. explorer\u21223 was completed after investigation of three dose cohorts (0.25, 0.5 and 0.8 mg kg-1 , once every 4 days) had been completed. Twenty-four patients received 12 doses of concizumab or placebo in a 3 : 1 randomization over a 42-day period. Results No serious AEs and no anti-drug antibodies were observed. Fifty-four mild and two moderate AEs were observed in 19 patients. Concizumab exposure increased with dose in a non-linear manner, confirming target-mediated drug disposition. D-dimer and F<sub>1 + 2</sub> levels were increased mostly in the highest dose cohort, in line with previous observations. The level of unbound TFPI decreased in a dose-dependent manner, and was accompanied by a residual TFPI activity decrease and an increase in peak TG. Although the trial was not powered to evaluate efficacy, a trend towards lower bleeding rates was observed in patients in the highest dose cohort.

However, the age-specific cumulative risk (penetrance) of these cancers is still poorly defined for PMS2-associated Lynch syndrome. Using a large data set from a worldwide collaboration, our aim was to determine accurate penetrance measures of cancers for carriers of heterozygous pathogenic PMS2 variants.\nMETHODS: A modified segregation analysis was conducted that incorporated both genotyped and nongenotyped relatives, with conditioning for ascertainment to estimates corrected for bias. Hazard ratios (HRs) and corresponding 95% CIs were estimated for each cancer site for mutation carriers compared with the general population, followed by estimation of penetrance.\nRESULTS: In total, 284 families consisting of 4,878 first- and second-degree family members were included in the analysis. PMS2 mutation carriers were at increased risk for colorectal cancer (cumulative risk to age 80 years of 13% [95% CI, 7.9% to 22%] for males and 12% [95% CI, 6.7% to 21%] for females) and endometrial cancer (13% [95% CI, 7.0%-24%]), compared with the general population (6.6%, 4.7%, and 2.4%, respectively). There was no clear evidence of an increased risk of ovarian, gastric, hepatobiliary, bladder, renal, brain, breast, prostate, or small bowel cancer.\nCONCLUSION: Heterozygous PMS2 mutation carriers were at small increased risk for colorectal and endometrial cancer but not for any other Lynch syndrome-associated cancer. This finding justifies that PMS2-specific screening protocols could be restricted to colonoscopies. The role of risk-reducing hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy for PMS2 mutation carriers needs further discussion.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25856668": "Germ-line mutations in MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 have been shown to cause Lynch syndrome. The penetrance of the cancer and tumor spectrum has been repeatedly studied, and multiple professional societies have proposed clinical management guidelines for affected individuals. Several studies have demonstrated a reduced penetrance for monoallelic carriers of PMS2 mutations compared with the other mismatch repair (MMR) genes, but clinical management guidelines have largely proposed the same screening recommendations for all MMR gene carriers. The authors considered whether enough evidence existed to propose new screening guidelines specific to PMS2 mutation carriers with regard to age at onset and frequency of colonic screening. Published reports of PMS2 germ-line mutations were combined with unpublished cases from the authors' research registries and clinical practices, and a discussion of potential modification of cancer screening guidelines was pursued. A total of 234 monoallelic PMS2 mutation carriers from 170 families were included. Approximately 8% of those with colorectal cancer (CRC) were diagnosed before age 30, and each of these tumors presented on the left side of the colon. As it is currently unknown what causes the early onset of CRC in some families with monoallelic PMS2 germline mutations, the authors recommend against reducing cancer surveillance guidelines in families found having monoallelic PMS2 mutations in spite of the reduced penetrance.Genet Med 18 1, 13-19.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15256438": "The MutLalpha heterodimer formed by mismatch repair (MMR) proteins MLH1 and PMS2 is a major component of the MMR complex, yet mutations in the PMS2 gene are rare in the etiology of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer. Evidence from five published cases suggested that contrary to the Knudson principle, PMS2 mutations cause hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer or Turcot syndrome only when they are biallelic in the germline or abnormally expressed. As candidates for PMS2 mutations, we selected seven patients whose colon tumors stained negative for PMS2 and positive for MLH1 by immunohistochemistry. After conversion to haploidy, truncating germline mutations of PMS2 were found in two patients (2192delTAACT and deletion of exon 8). These mutations abrogated PMS2 protein in germline cells by Western analysis. In two additional patients, PMS2 protein from one allele also was abrogated. Novel or previously described missense variants of PMS2 were detected, but their pathogenicity is undetermined. We detected and characterized a new transcript, PMS2CL, showing 98% sequence identity with exons 9 and 11-15 of PMS2 and emanating from a locus close to PMS2 in chromosome 7p. Its predicted protein product was not detected. Thus, in addition to several previously described PMS2-related genes resembling the 5' end of PMS2, at least one related gene resembles the 3' end of PMS2. In conclusion, both detectable and presently undefined germline mutations are deleterious and produce susceptibility to cancer by the two-hit mechanism. Paralogous genes interfere with mutation detection, resulting in underdiagnosis of PMS2 mutations.

Recently, it was shown that germline mutations in another mismatch repair gene, PMS2, play a far more important role in Lynch syndrome than initially thought. To explore this further, we determined the prevalence of pathogenic germline PMS2 mutations in a series of Lynch syndrome-suspected patients. Ninety-seven patients who had early-onset microsatellite instable colorectal or endometrial cancer, or multiple Lynch syndrome-associated tumors and/or were from an Amsterdam Criteria II-positive family were selected for this study. These patients carried no pathogenic germline mutation in MLH1, MSH2, or MSH6. When available, tumors were investigated for immunohistochemical staining (IHC) for PMS2. PMS2 was screened in all patients by exon-by-exon sequencing. We identified four patients with a pathogenic PMS2 mutation (4%) among the 97 patients we selected. IHC of PMS2 was informative in one of the mutation carriers, and in this case, the tumor showed loss of PMS2 expression.

Here, we determined PMS2 mutation detection yield and mutation spectrum in a nationwide cohort of 396 probands. Furthermore, we studied concordance between tumor IHC/MSI (immunohistochemistry/microsatellite instability) profile and mutation carrier state. Overall, we found 52 different pathogenic PMS2 variants explaining 121 Lynch syndrome and nine CMMRD patients. In vitro mismatch repair assays suggested pathogenicity for three missense variants. Ninety-one PMS2 mutation carriers (70%) showed isolated loss of PMS2 in their tumors, for 31 (24%) no or inconclusive IHC was available, and eight carriers (6%) showed discordant IHC (presence of PMS2 or loss of both MLH1 and PMS2). Ten cases with isolated PMS2 loss (10%; 10/97) harbored MLH1 mutations.

The aim of this observational study was to evaluate the effect of nocturnal respiratory-related indices based on nocturnal respiratory polygraphy on clinical outcomes (including mortality and non-fatal events) in patients with ischemic stroke.\nMETHODS: A total of 328 consecutive patients (181 (55%) males, mean age 65.8 \u00b1 11.2 years old) with confirmed ischemic stroke admitted to a stroke unit within 24 h after stroke onset were included in the analysis. All patients underwent standard diagnostic and treatment procedures, and sleep polygraphy was performed within the clinical routine in the first 72 h after admission. The long-term outcomes were assessed by cumulative endpoint (death of any cause, new non-fatal myocardial infarction, new non-fatal stroke/transient ischemic attack, emergency revascularization, emergency hospitalization due to the worsening of cardiovascular disease). A Cox-regression analysis was applied to evaluate the effects of nocturnal respiratory indices on survival.\nRESULTS: The mean follow-up period comprised 12 months (maximal-48 months). Patients with unfavourable outcomes demonstrated a higher obstructive apnea-hypopnea index, a higher hypoxemia burden assessed as a percent of the time with SpO<sub>2</sub> &lt; 90%, a higher average desaturation drop, and a higher respiratory rate at night.

Thirty-two studies were identified, including 22 observational studies and 10 randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Identified studies included the following as predictors of post-stroke recurrent events: obstructive sleep apnea (OSA, n\u00a0=\u00a015 studies), treatment of OSA with positive airway pressure (PAP, n\u00a0=\u00a013 studies), sleep quality and/or insomnia (n\u00a0=\u00a03 studies), sleep duration (n\u00a0=\u00a01 study), polysomnographic sleep/sleep architecture metrics (n\u00a0=\u00a01 study), and restless legs syndrome (n\u00a0=\u00a01 study). A positive relationship of OSA and/or OSA severity with recurrent events/mortality was seen. Findings on PAP treatment for OSA were mixed. Positive findings indicating a benefit of PAP for post-stroke risk came largely from observational studies (pooled RR [95% CI] for association between PAP and recurrent cardiovascular event: 0.37 [0.17-0.79], I2\u00a0=\u00a00%).

Observational studies have shown an increased risk of ischemic stroke in patients with untreated OSA when compared with patients treated with CPAP; however, results are not statistically significant. RCTs and meta-analyses have shown no significant ischemic stroke risk reduction in CPAP treated patients with OSA. Several studies have shown improved outcomes in post-stroke patients with OSA treated with CPAP; however, few data is available for subsequent ischemic stroke risk reduction. Further research is needed for surgical treatment of OSA and assessment of ischemic stroke risk. OSA is associated with increased risk of ischemic stroke, and OSA should be treated with the appropriate therapy.

One reason might be that widely used clinical criteria for detection of OSA in the general community are not applicable in patients with stroke. We hypothesized that patients with stroke report less sleepiness and are less obese than subjects from a community sample with the same severity of OSA.\nMETHODS: We performed polysomnography in 96 consecutive patients with stroke admitted to a stroke rehabilitation unit and in a community sample of 1093 subjects without a history of stroke. We compared the degrees of subjective sleepiness assessed by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale and body mass index between the 2 samples according to OSA categories assessed by the frequency of apneas and hypopneas per hour of sleep (<5, no OSA; 5 to <15 mild OSA; and >or=15, moderate to severe OSA).\nRESULTS: Compared with the community sample, patients with stroke with OSA had significantly lower Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores and body mass index for mild OSA (Epworth Sleepiness Scale 9.3+/-0.3 versus 5.6+/-0.5, P<0.001 and body mass index 33.1+/-0.5 versus 28.5+/-1.1, P<0.048) and for moderate to severe OSA (Epworth Sleepiness Scale 9.7+/-0.4 versus 7.1+/-0.9, P=0.043 and body mass index 36.4+/-0.8 versus 27.2+/-0.8 kg/m(2), P<0.025).\nCONCLUSIONS: For a given severity of OSA, patients with stroke had less daytime sleepiness and lower body mass index than subjects without stroke. These factors may make the diagnosis of OSA elusive in the poststroke period and preclude many such patients from the potential benefits of OSA therapy.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18927265": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) increases the risk of stroke independent of known vascular and metabolic risk factors. Although patients with OSA have higher prevalence of hypertension and evidence of hypercoagulability, the mechanism of this increased risk is unknown. Obstructive apnea events are associated with surges in blood pressure, hypercapnia, and fluctuations in cerebral blood flow. These perturbations can adversely affect the cerebral circulation. We hypothesized that patients with OSA have impaired cerebral autoregulation, which may contribute to the increased risk of cerebral ischemia and stroke. We examined cerebral autoregulation in patients with and without OSA by measuring cerebral artery blood flow velocity (CBFV) by using transcranial Doppler ultrasound and arterial blood pressure using finger pulse photoplethysmography during orthostatic hypotension and recovery as well as during 5% CO(2) inhalation. Cerebral vascular conductance and reactivity were determined. Forty-eight subjects, 26 controls (age 41.0+/-2.3 yr) and 22 OSA (age 46.8+/-2.3 yr) free of cerebrovascular and active coronary artery disease participated in this study. OSA patients had a mean apnea-hypopnea index of 78.4+/-7.1 vs. 1.8+/-0.3 events/h in controls. The oxygen saturation during sleep was significantly lower in the OSA group (78+/-2%) vs. 91+/-1% in controls. The dynamic vascular analysis showed mean CBFV was significantly lower in OSA patients compared with controls (48+/-3 vs. 55+/-2 cm/s; P <0.05, respectively). The OSA group had a lower rate of recovery of cerebrovascular conductance for a given drop in blood pressure compared with controls (0.06+/-0.02 vs. 0.20+/-0.06 cm.s(-2).mmHg(-1); P <0.05). There was no difference in cerebrovascular vasodilatation in response to CO(2). The findings showed that patients with OSA have decreased CBFV at baseline and delayed cerebrovascular compensatory response to changes in blood pressure but not to CO(2).

This abnormality can be identified early in gestation and the damage can be progressive over the course of pregnancy. Advances in fetal treatment have made minimally invasive prenatal surgery a realistic consideration for spina bifida in order to improve the outcome for children affected this condition.\nEVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Prenatal surgery for spina bifida via open fetal surgery with hysterotomy decreases the rate of ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement and improves motor function compared to standard postnatal surgery. Maternal risks of open fetal surgery are primarily related to complications of the hysterotomy including thinning or rupture that begins in the index pregnancy but persists for every future pregnancy. Minimizing maternal risks is the largest impetus to explore and optimize a minimally invasive fetoscopic alternative. Techniques vary from using a complete percutaneous approach to open fetoscopy, which requires laparotomy but is minimally invasive to the uterus. This allows vaginal delivery at term and no scar complications are reported thus far. Fetal short-term neurosurgical outcomes compare favorably with improvement in hindbrain herniation >70% and decreased need for treatment for hydrocephalus between 40-45% after prenatal surgery performed either fetoscopically or through open fetal surgery.\nEVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Maternal obstetric outcomes are superior for fetoscopic spina bifida repair compared to open fetal surgery and avoids the ongoing risk in future pregnancy. Neonatal and infant benefits appear equivalent. The open fetoscopic approach minimizes the risk of ruptured membranes and subsequent preterm delivery as opposed to a completely percutaneous procedure. International collaboration is ongoing to share experience and assess long term treatment effects.\nCONCLUSIONS: Continued refinement of a minimally invasive strategy for prenatal treatment of spina bifida is necessary to maximize benefits to the child and further minimize maternal risks and preterm birth.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36964773": "Spina bifida is a serious birth defect affecting the central nervous system, characterized by incomplete closure of the neural tube. Ethiopia has a very high prevalence of spina bifida, affecting about 40 cases per 10,000 births.

All women underwent two prenatal systematic ultrasound evaluations, approximately 4\u2009weeks apart, with the second one being performed less than 1\u2009week before surgery, and one postnatal evaluation via physical examination within 2\u2009months of birth. Motor-function classification was from spinal level T12 to S1, according to key muscle function. Each leg was analyzed separately; in case of discrepancy between the two legs, the worst motor-function level was considered for analysis. Motor-function-level evaluations were compared with each other and with the anatomical level as observed on ultrasound. Independent predictors of a postnatal reduction in motor-function level were assessed using a logistic regression model.\nRESULTS: Prenatal motor-function level was assessed at a median gestational age of 22.5 (interquartile range (IQR), 20.7-24.3) and 26.7 (IQR, 25.4-27.3) weeks, with a median interval of 4.0 (IQR, 2.4-6.0)\u2009weeks. The median gestational age at surgery was 27.0 (IQR, 25.9-27.6)\u2009weeks and the postnatal examination was at median age of 0.8 (IQR, 0.3-5.4)\u2009months. There was no significant difference in motor-function level between the two prenatal evaluations (P\u2009=\u20090.861). We therefore decided to use the second prenatal evaluation for comparison with postnatal motor function and anatomical level. Overall, prenatal and postnatal motor function evaluations were significantly different from the anatomical level (preoperative assessment, P\u2009=\u20090.0015; postnatal assessment, P\u2009=\u20090.0333). Comparing prenatal with postnatal motor-function level, we found that 87.2% of babies had similar or improved motor function compared with that prior to prenatal surgery. On logistic regression analysis, lower anatomical level of defect and greater difference between anatomical level and prenatal motor-function level were identified as independent predictors of postnatal motor function (odds ratio, 0.237 (95%\u2009CI, 0.095-0.588) (P\u2009=\u20090.002) and 3.44 (95%\u2009CI, 1.738-6.813) (P\u2009<\u20090.001), respectively).\nCONCLUSIONS: During a 4-week interval between first ultrasound evaluation and late fetal surgical repair of open spina bifida, motor function does not change significantly, suggesting that late repair, \u2265\u200926\u2009weeks, does not impact negatively on motor-function outcome.

Spina bifida should be found in utero for the immediate operation after birth. At present, most of these major anomalies of CNS can be successfully screened or diagnosed by using ultrasonography. Brain anomalies such as hydrocephalus, Dandy-Walker anomaly and holoprosencephaly show characteristic dilatation of ventricles, which can be easily found in the routine screening ultrasonography from the beginning of the second trimester of gestation. Ultrasonographic detection of neural tube defects such as anencephaly and spina bifida is not difficult in utero. Thus it is possible to diagnose the most of CNS anomalies by using prenatal ultrasound in the early stage of gestation now. Recent advances of ultrasonography, particularly the development of transvaginal technique have contributed to the earlier diagnosis of CNS anomaly even in the first trimester of gestation.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33805441": "Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is a late-onset intractable myopathy, characterized by slowly progressive ptosis, dysphagia, and proximal limb weakness. It is caused by the abnormal expansion of the alanine-encoding (GCN)n trinucleotide repeat in the exon 1 of the polyadenosine (poly[A]) binding protein nuclear 1 gene (11-18 repeats in OPMD instead of the normal 10 repeats). As the disease progresses, the patients gradually develop a feeling of suffocation, regurgitation of food, and aspiration pneumonia, although the initial symptoms and the progression patterns vary among the patients. Autologous myoblast transplantation may provide therapeutic benefits by reducing swallowing problems in these patients. Therefore, it is important to assemble information on such patients for the introduction of effective treatments in nonendemic areas. Herein, we present a concise review of recent progress in clinical and pathological studies of OPMD and introduce an idea for setting up a nation-wide OPMD disease registry in Japan. Since it is important to understand patients' unmet medical needs, realize therapeutically targetable symptoms, and identify indices of therapeutic efficacy, our attempt to establish a unique patient registry of OPMD will be a helpful tool to address these urgent issues.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35942670": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Oculopharyngodistal myopathy (OPDM) is a rare adolescent or adult-onset neuromuscular disease that is characterized by progressive ocular, facial, pharyngeal and distal limb muscle weakness. The rimmed vacuoles and intranuclear inclusions in myofibers constitute the pathological hallmark of OPDM. In this review, the latest findings related to the genetic, molecular and clinical features of OPDM, as well as the diagnosis and management are summarized.\nRECENT FINDINGS: Four gene mutations, CGG repeats in the 5'-untranslated region of LRP12 , GIPC1 , NOTCH2NLC and RILPL1 have been reported to be disease-causing genes in OPDM, namely OPDM1, OPDM2, OPDM3 and OPDM4, accordingly. So far, limited studies have suggested that CGG repeat expansion within the pathogenic range may play a key role in the pathogenesis of OPDM with the gain-of-function mechanism at the RNA and/or protein level, while repeat expansion over a threshold limit may cause hypermethylation, leading to the transcriptional silencing of the CGG repeats in the expanded allele, which results in the existence of mild phenotype or asymptomatic carriers.\nSUMMARY: Novel gene mutations, possible molecular mechanisms and the clinical features related to different causative genes are discussed in this review. More studies on the exact pathogenic mechanism are needed.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14526187": "Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is a muscle disease of late onset associated with progressive ptosis of the eyelids, dysphagia, and unique tubulofilamentous intranuclear inclusions (INIs). OPMD is usually transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait (OMIM 164300). A rarer allelic autosomal recessive form has also been observed (OMIM 257950). Both forms are caused by short (GCG)8-13 expansions in the polyadenylate-binding protein nuclear 1 gene (PABPN1) located on chromosome 14q11.1. The mutations cause the lengthening of an N-terminal polyalanine domain. Both slippage and unequal recombination have been proposed as the mutation mechanisms. The size of the mutation has not yet been conclusively shown to inversely correlate with the severity of the phenotype. Mutated PABPN1 proteins have been shown to be constituents of the INIs. The INIs also contain ubiquitin, proteasome subunits, HSP 40, HSP 70, SKIP, and abundant poly(A)-mRNA. The exact mechanism responsible for polyalanine toxicity in OPMD is unknown. Various intranuclear inclusion dependent and independent mechanisms have been proposed based on the major known function of PABPN1 in polyadenylation of mRNA and its shuttling from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. OPMD is one of the few triplet-repeat diseases for which the function of the mutated gene is known. Because of the increasing number of diseases caused by polyalanine expansions and the pathological overlap with CAG/polyglutamine diseases, what pathological insight is gained by the study of OPMD could lead to a better understanding of a much larger group of developmental and degenerative diseases.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29725764": "Dysphagia is one of the primary symptoms experienced by individuals with Oculopharyngeal Muscular Dystrophy (OPMD). However, we lack understanding of the discrete changes in swallowing physiology that are seen in OPMD, and the resulting relationship to impairments of swallowing safety and efficiency. This study sought to describe the pathophysiology of dysphagia in a small sample of patients with OPMD using a videofluoroscopy examination (VFSS) involving 3\u2009\u00d7\u20095\u00a0mL boluses of thin\u00a0liquid barium (22% w/v). The aim of this study is to extend what is known about the pathophysiology of dysphagia in OPMD, by quantifying changes in swallow timing, kinematics, safety, and efficiency, measured from VFSS. This study is a secondary analysis of baseline VFSS collected from 11 adults (4 male), aged 48-62 (mean 57) enrolled in an industry-sponsored phase 2 therapeutic drug trial. Blinded raters scored the VFSS recordings for safety [Penetration-Aspiration Scale (PAS)], efficiency [Normalized Residue Ratio Scale (NRRS)], timing [Pharyngeal Transit Time (PTT), Swallow Reaction Time (SRT), Laryngeal Vestibule Closure Reaction Time (LVCrt), Upper Esophageal Sphincter Opening Duration (UESD)], and kinematics (hyoid movement, pharyngeal constriction, UES opening width). Impairment thresholds from existing literature were defined to characterize swallowing physiology and function. Further, Fisher's Exact tests and Pearson's correlations were used to conduct a preliminary exploration of associations between swallowing physiology (e.g., kinematics, timing) and function (i.e., safety, efficiency). Compared to published norms, we identified significant differences in the degree of maximum pharyngeal constriction, hyoid movement distance and speed, as well as degree and timeliness of airway closure. Unsafe swallowing (PAS\u2009\u2265\u20093) was seen in only 3/11 patients. By contrast, clinically significant residue (i.e., NRRS scores\u2009\u2265\u20090.09 vallecular;\u2009\u2265\u20090.2 pyriform) was seen in 7/11 patients. Fisher's Exact tests revealed associations between prolonged SRT, PTT, and unsafe swallowing. Weak associations were also identified between post-swallow residue and poor pharyngeal constriction during the swallow. Detailed analysis of swallowing physiology in this series of adults with OPMD aligns with impaired muscular function (e.g., reduced pharyngeal constriction, incomplete laryngeal vestibule closure) associated with the disease, and primary functional challenges with swallow efficiency. Further work is needed to explore a greater range of food and liquid textures, and to identify additional physiological mechanisms underlying swallowing impairment in OPMD.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32842713": "Small non-coding microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in the regulation of mRNA stability. Their features, including high stability and secretion to biofluids, make them attractive as potential biomarkers for diverse pathologies. This is the first study reporting miRNA as potential biomarkers for oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD), an adult-onset myopathy. We hypothesized that miRNA that is differentially expressed in affected muscles from OPMD patients is secreted to biofluids and those miRNAs could be used as biomarkers for OPMD. We first identified candidate miRNAs from OPMD-affected muscles and from muscles from an OPMD mouse model using RNA sequencing. We then compared the OPMD-deregulated miRNAs to the literature and, subsequently, we selected a few candidates for expression studies in serum and saliva biofluids using qRT-PCR. We identified 126 miRNAs OPMD-deregulated in human muscles, but 36 deregulated miRNAs in mice only (pFDR &lt; 0.05). Only 15 OPMD-deregulated miRNAs overlapped between the in humans and mouse studies. The majority of the OPMD-deregulated miRNAs showed opposite deregulation direction compared with known muscular dystrophies miRNAs (myoMirs), which are associated. In contrast, similar dysregulation direction was found for 13 miRNAs that are common between OPMD and aging muscles. A significant age-association (p &lt; 0.05) was found for 17 OPMD-deregulated miRNAs (13.4%), whereas in controls, only six miRNAs (1.4%) showed a significant age-association, suggesting that miRNA expression in OPMD is highly age-associated. miRNA expression in biofluids revealed that OPMD-associated deregulation in saliva was similar to that in muscles, but not in serum. The same as in muscle, miRNA expression levels in saliva were also found to be associated with age (p &lt; 0.05). Moreover, the majority of OPMD-miRNAs were found to be associated with dysphagia as an initial symptom. We suggest that levels of specific miRNAs in saliva can mark muscle degeneration in general and dysphagia in OPMD.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37043653": "BACKGROUND: Erythropoietic protoporphyria and X-linked protoporphyria are inborn errors of heme biosynthesis that cause elevated circulating levels of metal-free protoporphyrin and phototoxicity. Both disorders are characterized by excruciating phototoxic attacks after exposure to visible light. Dersimelagon is a new, orally administered, selective melanocortin 1 receptor agonist that increases levels of skin eumelanin.\nMETHODS: We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial to investigate the efficacy and safety of dersimelagon with respect to the time to onset and the severity of symptoms associated with sunlight exposure in patients with erythropoietic protoporphyria or X-linked protoporphyria. Patients 18 to 75 years of age were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive placebo or dersimelagon at a dose of 100 or 300 mg once daily for 16 weeks. The primary end point was the change from baseline to week 16 in the time to the first prodromal symptom associated with sunlight exposure. Patients recorded daily sunlight exposure and symptom data in an electronic diary. Quality of life and safety were also assessed.\nRESULTS: Of the 102 patients (93 with erythropoietic protoporphyria and 9 with X-linked protoporphyria) who underwent randomization, 90% completed the treatment period. The mean daily time to the first prodromal symptom associated with sunlight exposure increased significantly with dersimelagon: the least-squares mean difference from placebo in the change from baseline to week 16 was 53.8 minutes in the 100-mg dersimelagon group (P\u2009=\u20090.008) and 62.5 minutes in the 300-mg dersimelagon group (P\u2009=\u20090.003). The results also suggest that quality of life improved in patients receiving dersimelagon as compared with placebo. The most common adverse events that occurred or worsened during treatment were nausea, freckles, headache, and skin hyperpigmentation.\nCONCLUSIONS: At both doses evaluated, dersimelagon significantly increased the duration of symptom-free sunlight exposure in patients with erythropoietic protoporphyria or X-linked protoporphyria.

Microarray-based gene expression analysis and serum protein profiling were performed in the BLM-induced SSc models. The effect of MT-7117 on transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2)-induced activation of human dermal fibroblasts was evaluated in vitro. Immunohistochemical analyses of MC1R expression in the skin of SSc patients were performed.\nRESULTS: Prophylactic treatment with MT-7117 (\u2265 0.3 mg/kg/day p.o.) significantly inhibited skin fibrosis and lung inflammation, and therapeutic treatment with MT-7117 (\u2265 3 mg/kg/day p.o.) significantly suppressed the development of skin fibrosis in the BLM-induced SSc models. Gene array analysis demonstrated that MT-7117 exerts an anti-inflammatory effect via suppression of the activation of inflammatory cells and inflammation-related signals; additionally, vascular dysfunction was extracted as the pathology targeted by MT-7117. Serum protein profiling revealed that multiple SSc-related biomarkers including P-selectin, osteoprotegerin, cystatin C, growth and differentiation factor-15, and S100A9 were suppressed by MT-7117. MT-7117 inhibited the activation of human dermal fibroblasts by suppressing TGF-\u03b2-induced ACTA2 (encoding \u03b1-smooth muscle actin) mRNA elevation.

Similar trends exist for colorectal adenoma, although the risk appears lower. Visceral fat, or abdominal obesity, seems to be of greater concern than subcutaneous fat obesity, and any 1 kg/m(2) increase in BMI confers additional risk (HR 1.03). Obesity might be associated with worse cancer outcomes, such as recurrence of the primary cancer or mortality. Several factors, including reduced sensitivity to antiangiogenic-therapeutic regimens, might explain these differences. Except for wound infection, obesity has no significant impact on surgical procedures. The underlying mechanisms linking obesity to CRC are still a matter of debate, but metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance and modifications in levels of adipocytokines seem to be of great importance.

However, both psilocybin and MDMA can increase blood pressure and heart rate, which could be a concern if used in older adults with cardiovascular disease. Very few older adults or patients with serious comorbidities have been included in clinical trials of psychedelics to date, raising the question of how generalizable study results are for the patients that most geropsychiatrists will be treating. Research on the neurophysiologic and mechanistic effects of psychedelics in older adults could also provide insights into the aging brain that could have clinical applications in the future. Given the potential of psychedelic compounds to benefit older adults, more research is needed to establish safety and efficacy among older adults, particularly those with multi-morbidity.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12691208": "The FDA and the Spanish Ministry of Health have concluded that the risk/benefit ratio is favorable under certain circumstances for clinical studies investigating MDMA-assisted psychotherapy. Both agencies have approved pilot studies in chronic posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) patients who have failed to obtain relief from at least one course of conventional treatment. These studies, the only ones in the world into the therapeutic use of MDMA, are being funded by a nonprofit research and educational organization, the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS, www.maps.org). A rationale is offered explaining why MAPS chose to focus its limited resources on MDMA, and also on PTSD patients. A Clinical Plan is elaborated for the conduct of the \"adequate and well-controlled\" trials necessary to evaluate the safety and efficacy of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for PTSD, with the studies estimated to cost about 5 million dollars and to take about five years. The Clinical Plan has been developed, in part, through analysis of the studies conducted by Pfizer in its successful effort to have Zoloft approved by the FDA for use with PTSD patients, and through review of transcripts of the FDA's Psychopharmacologic Drugs Advisory Committee meeting that recommended approval of Zoloft for PTSD.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26579955": "Prior to 1985, \u00b13,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) was readily used as a psychotherapeutic adjunct. As MDMA became popular in treating various psychiatric illnesses by mental health professionals, the public started to abuse the MDMA-containing recreational drug \"ecstasy.\" This alarmed the DEA, which led to emergency scheduling of MDMA as a Schedule I drug. Due to its scheduling in 1985, human research and clinical use has been limited. The majority of research on MDMA has been focused on the drug's potential harmful effects rather than its possible therapeutic effects. The limitations on retrospective human studies and preclinical animal models of MDMA neurotoxicity are examined in this analysis. New research has shown that MDMA, used as a catalyst in psychotherapy, is effective in treating posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This review also examines the psychopharmacological basis for the efficacy of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy. Specifically, the brain regions involved with both PTSD and those activated by MDMA (i.e., amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex, and hippocampus) are examined. Also, the possible neurochemical mechanisms involved in MDMA's efficacy in treating PTSD are reviewed.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37367190": "Bats are well-known to be natural reservoirs of various zoonotic coronaviruses, which have caused outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2002 and 2019, respectively. In late 2020, two new Sarbecoviruses were found in Russia, isolated in Rhinolophus bats, i.e., Khosta-1 in R. ferrumequinum and Khosta-2 in R. hipposideros. The potential danger associated with these new species of Sarbecovirus is that Khosta-2 has been found to interact with the same entry receptor as SARS-CoV-2. Our multidisciplinary approach in this study demonstrates that Khosta-1 and -2 currently appear to be not dangerous with low risk of spillover, as confirmed by prevalence data and by phylogenomic reconstruction. In addition, the interaction between Khosta-1 and -2 with ACE2 appears weak, and furin cleavage sites are absent. While the possibility of a spillover event cannot be entirely excluded, it is currently highly unlikely. This research further emphasizes the importance of assessing the zoonotic potential of widely distributed batborne CoV in order to monitor changes in genomic composition of viruses and prevent spillover events (if any).", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37672628": "Background: Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is a mosquito-borne zoonotic flavivirus and the leading cause of pediatric encephalitis in the Asian Pacific region. The transmission cycle primarily involves Culex spp. mosquitoes and Ardeid birds, with domestic pigs (Sus scrofa domestica) being the source of infectious viruses for the spillover of JEV from the natural endemic transmission cycle into the human population. Although many studies have concluded that domestic pigs play an important role in the transmission cycle of JEV, and infection of humans, the role of feral pigs in the transmission of JEV remains unclear. Since domestic and feral pigs are the same species, and because feral pig populations in the United States are increasing and expanding geographically, the current study aimed to test the hypothesis that if JEV were introduced into the United States, feral pigs might play a role in the transmission cycle. Materials and Methods: Sinclair miniature pigs, that exhibit the feral phenotype, were intradermally inoculated with JEV genotype Ib. These pigs were derived from crossing miniature domestic pig with four strains of feral pigs and were used since obtaining feral swine was not possible. Results: The Sinclair miniature pigs became viremic and displayed pathological outcomes similar to those observed in domestic swine. Conclusion: Based on these findings, we conclude that in the event of JEV being introduced into the United States, feral pig populations could contribute to establishment and maintenance of a transmission cycle of JEV and could lead to the virus becoming endemic in the United States.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28555073": "Zoonotic spillover, which is the transmission of a pathogen from a vertebrate animal to a human, presents a global public health burden but is a poorly understood phenomenon. Zoonotic spillover requires several factors to align, including the ecological, epidemiological and behavioural determinants of pathogen exposure, and the within-human factors that affect susceptibility to infection. In this Opinion article, we propose a synthetic framework for animal-to-human transmission that integrates the relevant mechanisms. This framework reveals that all zoonotic pathogens must overcome a hierarchical series of barriers to cause spillover infections in humans. Understanding how these barriers are functionally and quantitatively linked, and how they interact in space and time, will substantially improve our ability to predict or prevent spillover events.

As these events sometimes involve pathogens with epidemic or pandemic potential, they pose a serious threat to population health. Public policies may play a key role in preventing these events. The aim of this review is to identify evaluations of public policies that target the determinants of zoonotic spillover, examining approaches taken to evaluation, choice of outcomes measures and evidence of effectiveness. Our approach to identifying and analysing this literature will be informed by a One Health lens, acknowledging the interconnectedness of human, animal and environmental health.\nMETHODS AND ANALYSIS: A systematic scoping review methodology will be used. To identify articles, we will search Medline, SCOPUS, Web of Science and Global Health in May 2021 using search terms combining animal health and the animal-human interface, public policy, prevention and zoonoses. We will screen titles and abstracts and extract data according to published guidelines for scoping reviews. All evaluations of public policies aiming to prevent zoonotic spillover events will be eligible for inclusion. We will summarise key data from each study, mapping policies along the spillover pathway and outlining the range of policies, approaches to evaluation and outcome measures. Review findings will provide a useful reference for researchers and practitioners, outlining the state of the evaluative evidence around policies to prevent zoonotic spillover.\nETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Formal ethical approval is not required, because the study does not involve primary data collection.

The factors leading to such spillover events are little explored. Filoviridae viruses have a wide range of natural hosts and are unstable once outside hosts. Spillover events, which involve the physical transfer of viral particles across species, could therefore be directly promoted by conditions of host ecology and environment. In this report, we outline a proof of concept that temporal fluctuations of a set of ecological and environmental variables describing the dynamics of the host ecosystem are able to predict such events of Ebola virus spillover to humans and animals. We compiled a data set of climate and plant phenology variables and Ebola virus disease spillovers in humans and animals. We identified critical biotic and abiotic conditions for spillovers via multiple regression and neural network-based time series regression. Phenology variables proved to be overall better predictors than climate variables. African phenology variables are not yet available as a comprehensive online resource. Given the likely importance of phenology for forecasting the likelihood of future Ebola spillover events, our results highlight the need for cost-effective transect surveys to supply phenology data for predictive modelling efforts.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30506906": "INTRODUCTION: Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD) is a hereditary myopathy characterized as triad of muscular dystrophy, joint contractures, and conduction cardiomyopathy.

Targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) was performed to identify the underlying mutation in the proband and validated by Sanger sequencing. Segregation analysis was applied to all 13 participants.\nRESULTS: A novel frameshift mutation (c.253_254insT, p.Y85Lfs*8) of emerin gene (EMD) was found and co-segregated with family members.

However, this disorder is linked to 8 different genes encoding nuclear envelope proteins, raising the question of whether a particular protein is most relevant. Therefore, myoblast/fibroblast cultures from biopsy and tissue sections from a panel of nine Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy patients (4 male, 5 female) including those carrying emerin and FHL1 (X-linked) and several lamin A (autosomal dominant) mutations were stained for the proteins linked to the disorder. As tissue-specific nuclear envelope proteins have been postulated to mediate the tissue-specific pathologies of different nuclear envelopathies, patient samples were also stained for several muscle-specific nuclear membrane proteins. Although linked proteins nesprin 1 and SUN2 and muscle-specific proteins NET5/Samp1 and Tmem214 yielded aberrant distributions in individual patient cells, none exhibited defects through the larger patient panel. Muscle-specific Tmem38A normally appeared in both the nuclear envelope and sarcoplasmic reticulum, but most patient samples exhibited a moderate redistribution favouring the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The absence of striking uniform defects in nuclear envelope protein distribution indicates that such staining will be unavailing for general diagnostics, though it remains possible that specific mutations exhibiting protein distribution defects might reflect a particular clinical variant. These findings further argue that multiple pathways can lead to the generally similar pathologies of this disorder while at the same time the different cellular phenotypes observed possibly may help explain the considerable clinical variation of EDMD.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27179216": "Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD), a rare inherited disease, is characterized clinically by humero-peroneal muscle atrophy and weakness, multijoint contractures, spine rigidity and cardiac insufficiency with conduction defects.

The majority of the EDMD cases described so far are of the emerinopathy (EDMD1) kind, with a recessive X-linked mode of inheritance, or else laminopathy (EDMD2), with an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance.

EDMD is also distinctive for its association with defects of the cardiac conduction system that can result in sudden death. It can be inherited in an X-linked, autosomal dominant, or autosomal recessive fashion and is caused by mutations in proteins of the nuclear membrane. Mutations in the EMD gene, which encodes emerin, a transmembrane protein found at the inner nuclear membrane, are responsible for X-linked EDMD. The most common etiology of autosomal dominant EDMD is an LMNA gene mutation; LMNA encodes the intermediate filament protein lamins A and C, which constitute the major scaffolding protein of the inner nuclear membrane. Murine models of LMNA gene mutations have helped to identify different mechanisms of disease. Loss of LMNA function leads to nuclear fragility as well as other defects, such as abnormal nuclear function. Additional genes encoding nuclear membrane proteins such as SYNE1 and SYNE2 have also been implicated in EDMD, and in some cases their importance for cardiac and muscle function has been supported by animal modeling.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17567779": "Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD) is an inherited disorder characterized by slowly progressive skeletal muscle weakness in a humero-peroneal distribution, early contractures and prominent cardiomyopathy with conduction block.

Emerin and A-type lamins are proteins of the inner membrane of the nuclear envelope. Whereas the genetic cause of EDMD has been described and the proteins well characterized, little is known on how abnormalities in nuclear envelope proteins cause striated muscle disease. In this study, we analyzed genome-wide expression profiles in hearts from Emd knockout mice, a model of X-linked EDMD, using Affymetrix GeneChips. This analysis showed a molecular signature similar to that we previously described in hearts from Lmna H222P knock-in mice, a model of autosomal dominant EDMD. There was a common activation of the ERK1/2 branch of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway in both murine models, as well as activation of downstream targets implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiomyopathy.

We compared pregnancies with first trimester exposure to lamotrigine monotherapy to ASM-unexposed, carbamazepine, valproate, oxcarbazepine, levetiracetam, and topiramate to lamotrigine monotherapy, and stratified monotherapy groups by dose. The outcome was nongenetic MCM and specific subtypes. We estimated adjusted risk ratios (aRRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) with log-binomial regression and propensity score weights.\nRESULTS: There was a higher crude risk of any MCM in pregnancies exposed to lamotrigine monotherapy (n\u00a0=\u00a08,339) compared to ASM-unexposed pregnancies (n\u00a0=\u00a04,866,362), but not after confounder adjustment (aRR\u00a0=\u00a00.97, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.87-1.08). Compared to lamotrigine, there was an increased risk of malformations associated with valproate (n\u00a0=\u00a02,031, aRR\u00a0=\u00a02.05, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.70-2.46) and topiramate (n\u00a0=\u00a0509, aRR\u00a0=\u00a01.81, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.26-2.60), which increased in a dose-dependent manner. We found no differences in malformation risk for carbamazepine (n\u00a0=\u00a02,674, aRR\u00a0=\u00a00.91, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.72-1.15), oxcarbazepine (n\u00a0=\u00a01,313, aRR =\u20091.09, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.83-1.44), or levetiracetam (n\u00a0=\u00a01,040, aRR\u00a0=\u00a00.78, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.53-1.13). Valproate was associated with several malformation subtypes, including nervous system, cardiac, oral clefts, clubfoot, and hypospadias, whereas lamotrigine and carbamazepine were not.\nINTERPRETATION: Topiramate is associated with an increased risk of MCM similar to that associated with valproate, but lower doses may mitigate the risks for both drugs. Conversely, we found no increased risks for lamotrigine, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, or levetiracetam, which is reassuring.

For the German Pharmacoepidemiological Research Database (GePaRD), covering ~20% of the German population, algorithms have been developed to identify pregnancies, to estimate their date of onset and to link mothers to their babies. Using this methodology, we aimed to conduct a proof-of-concept analysis on the known association between valproate (VPA) exposure in early pregnancy and spina bifida in the exposed child.\nMETHODS: We identified all pregnancies in GePaRD between 2006 and 2016 in women aged 12 to 50\u2009years. To each VPA dispensation of these women, an exposure period was assigned, based on the dispensation date and the number of defined daily doses in the dispensed package. A pregnancy was classified as exposed to VPA in the critical time window if this exposure period overlapped with the first 55\u2009days of pregnancy. Risk ratios were calculated for spina bifida in live births and induced abortions comparing VPA-exposed ones to all pregnancies.\nRESULTS: Overall, we identified 1\u2009271\u2009384 pregnancies fulfilling the inclusion criteria. Of these, 668 pregnancies (0.053%) were classified as exposed to VPA in the critical time window regarding spina bifida. An induced abortion accompanied by a diagnosis of spina bifida was observed in one of the VPA-exposed pregnancies (0.15%) and in 154 of all pregnancies (0.012%), yielding a risk ratio of 12.4 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.7-88.2). Out of 775\u2009875 pregnancies ending in a live birth, 366 (0.047%) were classified as VPA exposed. A diagnosis of spina bifida was coded in 3 of 366 VPA-exposed live births (0.82%) and in 260 of all live births (0.03%), yielding a relative risk of 24.5 (95% CI: 7.9-76.0).\nCONCLUSIONS: Our proof-of-concept analysis based on GePaRD showed a strong association between intrauterine exposure to VPA and occurrence of spina bifida.

Clinical and demographic information from each database was transformed to the ConcePTION Common Data Model, quality checks were conducted and a distributed analysis was performed using common scripts. Incident and prevalent use of valproate, proportion of discontinuers and switchers to alternative medicine, frequency of contraception coverage during valproate use, and occurrence of pregnancies during valproate exposure were estimated per month. Interrupted time series analyses were conducted to estimate the level or trend change in the outcome measures.\nRESULTS: We included 69,533 valproate users from 9,699,371 females of childbearing potential from the five participating centres. A significant decline in prevalent use of valproates was observed in Tuscany, Italy (mean difference post-intervention -7.7%), Spain (-11.3%), and UK (-5.9%) and a non-significant decline in the Netherlands (-3.3%), but no decline in incident use after the 2018 RMMs compared to the period before. The monthly proportion of compliant valproate prescriptions/dispensings with a contraceptive coverage was low (<25%), with an increase after the 2018 RMMs only in the Netherlands (mean difference post-intervention 12%). There was no significant increase in switching rates from valproates to alternative medicine after the 2018 intervention in any of the countries/regions. We observed a substantial number of concurrent pregnancies during valproate exposure, but with a declining rate after the 2018 RMMs in Tuscany, Italy (0.70 per 1000 valproate users pre- and 0.27 post-intervention), Spain (0.48 and 0.13), the Netherlands (0.34 and 0.00), and an increasing rate in UK (1.13 and 5.07).\nCONCLUSION: There was a small impact of the 2018 RMMs on valproate use in the studied European countries/regions.

However, to date, there has been little synthesis of the strength, precision, and quality of this evidence in aggregate.\nOBJECTIVE: To grade the evidence from published meta-analyses of prospective observational studies that assessed the association of dietary patterns, specific foods, food groups, beverages (including alcohol), macronutrients, and micronutrients with the incidence of CRC.\nDATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched from database inception to September 2019.\nEVIDENCE REVIEW: Only meta-analyses of prospective observational studies with a cohort study design were eligible. Evidence of association was graded according to established criteria as follows: convincing, highly suggestive, suggestive, weak, or not significant.\nRESULTS: From 9954 publications, 222 full-text articles (2.2%) were evaluated for eligibility, and 45 meta-analyses (20.3%) that described 109 associations between dietary factors and CRC incidence were selected. Overall, 35 of the 109 associations (32.1%) were nominally statistically significant using random-effects meta-analysis models; 17 associations (15.6%) demonstrated large heterogeneity between studies (I2\u2009>\u200950%), whereas small-study effects were found for 11 associations (10.1%). Excess significance bias was not detected for any association between diet and CRC. The primary analysis identified 5 (4.6%) convincing, 2 (1.8%) highly suggestive, 10 (9.2%) suggestive, and 18 (16.5%) weak associations between diet and CRC, while there was no evidence for 74 (67.9%) associations. There was convincing evidence of an association of intake of red meat (high vs low) and alcohol (\u22654 drinks/d vs 0 or occasional drinks) with the incidence of CRC and an inverse association of higher vs lower intakes of dietary fiber, calcium, and yogurt with CRC risk. The evidence for convincing associations remained robust following sensitivity analyses.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This umbrella review found convincing evidence of an association between lower CRC risk and higher intakes of dietary fiber, dietary calcium, and yogurt and lower intakes of alcohol and red meat.

Epidemiological studies have shown that a high fat (or meat) intake is associated positively and a high starch, fibre (non-starch polysaccharide), vegetable and fruit intake negatively with colorectal cancer incidence. One mechanism by which these effects are possibly exerted is through the metabolism of secondary bile acids. Secondary bile acids are formed after enzymatic deconjugation and dehydroxylation of primary bile acids in the large bowel by anaerobic bacteria. It has been shown that these compounds can have tumour-promoting capacities in animal experiments. In epidemiological studies, colonic cancer risk is related to the faecal bile acid concentration. In serum and bile of patients with colonic adenomas, more deoxycholic acid was detected than in healthy controls. Secondary bile acids are toxic to several cell systems at physiological concentrations. The exact mechanism by which these amphiphilic molecules exert their action is not well understood. It might act through membrane damage, intracellular mitochondrial action or genotoxic effects. So far the evidence that bile acids are involved in colonic carcinogenesis is largely circumstantial. It is, however, well accepted that environmental factors, such as dietary habits influence genetic susceptibility. Bile acids could play a promoting role in this process.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29873077": "Distal and proximal colon tumors have distinct incidence trends and embryonic origins; whether these sub-sites have distinct susceptibilities to known risk factors is unclear. We used pooled data from 407,270 participants in three US-based studies, with overall median follow-up of 13.8 years. We used adjusted Cox models to analyze the association between dietary intakes (from diet history questionnaire) of total, processed and unprocessed red meat; total white meat, poultry and fish and meat-related compounds: heme iron, nitrate, nitrite, the heterocyclic amines (HCAs) and benzo(a)pyrene (B(a)P) and incidence of colorectal cancer subsites. The risk of colorectal cancer (n = 6,640) increased by 35% for each 50 g/1,000 kcal higher daily intake of total red meat, with a significant right-to-left trend from proximal colon (HR: 1.24; 95% CI: 1.09-1.39) to distal colon (HR: 1.34; 95% CI: 1.13-1.55) and rectum (HR: 1.53; 95% CI: 1.28-1.79).

The highest quintile of heme iron was associated with increased cancer risk only in the distal colon (HR: 1.20; 95% CI: 1.02-1.42) and rectum (HR: 1.27; 95% CI: 1.07-1.52). The highest quintile of HCAs, and nitrate/nitrite were associated with increased risk of total colorectal cancer, but these associations did not vary across anatomical subsites.

Conversely, the consumption of fruits, vegetables and fiber decreases the risk of CRC, which is why dietary polyphenols have aroused interest in recent years as potentially anti-carcinogenic compounds. One of the driving forces of colorectal carcinogenesis, in both sporadic and hereditary CRC, is the aberrant activation/regulation of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway. This review discusses reports of modulation of the Wnt/\u03b2-Catenin signaling pathway by dietary polyphenols (resveratrol, avenanthramides, epigallocatechinin, curcumin, quercetin, silibinin, genistein and mangiferin) specifically focusing on CRC, and proposes a model as to how this modulation occurs. There is potential for implementing these dietary polyphenols into preventative and therapeutic therapies for CRC as evidenced by some clinical trials that have been carried out with promising results.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36992261": "DNA integrity is a key issue in gene therapy and genetic vaccine approaches based on plasmid DNA. In contrast to messenger RNA that requires a controlled cold chain for efficacy, DNA molecules are considered to be more stable. In this study, we challenged this concept by characterizing the immunological response induced by a plasmid DNA vaccine delivered using electroporation. As a model, we used COVID-eVax, a plasmid DNA-based vaccine that targets the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Increased nicked DNA was produced by using either an accelerated stability protocol or a lyophilization protocol. Surprisingly, the immune response induced in vivo was only minimally affected by the percentage of open circular DNA. This result suggests that plasmid DNA vaccines, such as COVID-eVax that have recently completed a phase I clinical trial, retain their efficacy upon storage at higher temperatures, and this feature may facilitate their use in low-/middle-income countries.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38063059": "INTRODUCTION: Nucleic acids represent a promising platform for creating vaccines. One disadvantage of this approach is its relatively low immunogenicity. Electroporation (EP) is an effective way to increase the DNA vaccines immunogenicity. However, due to the different configurations of devices used for EP, EP protocols optimization is required not only to enhance immunogenicity, but also to ensure greater safety and tolerability of the EP procedure.\nAREA COVERED: An data analysis for recent years on the DNA vaccines delivery against viral and parasitic infections using EP was carried out. The study of various EP physical characteristics, such as frequency, pulse duration, pulse interval, should be considered along with the immunogenic construct design and the site of delivery of the vaccine, through the study of the immunogenic and protective characteristics of the latter.\nEXPERT OPINION: Future research should focus on regulating the humoral and cellular response required for protection against infectious agents by modifying the EP protocol. Significant efforts will be directed to establishing the possibility of redirecting the immune response toward the Th1 or Th2 response by changing the EP physical parameters. It will allow for an individual selective approach during EP, depending on the pathogen type of an infectious disease.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15110305": "DNA vaccines are attracting increased attention due to multiple advantages over conventional vaccines. Attempts to improve these vaccines focus on enhancing DNA delivery and employing novel immunoadjuvants. Electroporation (EP) has emerged as an effective method for delivering DNA vaccines, significantly enhancing humoral and cellular responses. To further improve EP-augmented DNA vaccination, we used micron-size gold particles as a particulate adjuvant. DNA is not bound, or adsorbed, to the particles. Gold particles were coinjected intradermally with plasmid DNA encoding the hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) into mice, both in the absence and presence of noninvasive EP. The particles enhanced the percentage of responding animals, and shortened the time for reaching maximal antibody titers by 2 weeks. Subtyping of the produced antibodies revealed a predominantly Th1-like response which did not change significantly with the absence or presence of particles. The particles likely function as an attractant for antigen-presenting cells (APCs), and probably do not affect EP or antigen expression to a significant extent. We conclude that micron-size gold particles injected intradermally together with DNA followed by EP give rise to an accelerated, potent immune response with a strong cellular component. This method may become important for the development of fast-acting therapeutic and prophylactic vaccines.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19619001": "We are evaluating the use of electroporation (EP) to deliver a novel DNA vaccine, p.DOM-PSMA(27).

We report on safety and tolerability and on antibody response to DOM as a first indication of the effect of EP in patients. In this open label phase I/II, two-arm, dose escalation trial DNA was delivered either by intramuscular injection or by intramuscular injection followed by EP (DNA+EP), with five patients per dose level. Three vaccinations were given at 0, 4, and 8 weeks,with booster doses at 24 and 48 weeks; here we allowed crossover between study arms if supported by the safety and immunological data. In the 20 patients in the first two dose cohorts we observed that beyond brief and acceptable pain at the injection site, EP did not appear to add toxicity to the vaccination. We evaluated humoral responses to DOM. Low anti-DOM IgG antibody responses were observed after intramuscular injection of DNA without EP (at week 12: mean 1.7- vs. 24.5-fold increase over baseline with DNA+EP). These could be boosted by delivery of DNA+EP at later time points. Delivery of DNA+EP at all five vaccinations yielded the highest levels of anti-DOM antibody. Responses persisted to 18 months of follow-up. These data establish EP as a potent method for stimulating humoral responses induced by DNA vaccination in humans.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21180650": "The without a doubt major obstacle for making DNA vaccines a commercial success is delivery. If delivery cannot be made simple, cheap and effective, DNA vaccines may not become a viable option for human use. Numerous clinical trials have confirmed that a standard needle and syringe simply do not do the job, i.e., delivering the DNA payload inside the cell. Having recognized this shortcoming, investigators have developed several new approaches for DNA vaccine delivery. In particular, new types of delivery devices, originally intended for in vitro use, have been applied for in vivo delivery. These include particle bombardment or biolistic delivery, and in vivo electroporation (EP). Importantly, both techniques seem to overcome the size barrier, meaning that they work in both mice and larger animals. In vivo EP has the key features of improved DNA uptake, increased antigen expression and a local inflammation. These factors are essential to make DNA vaccines effective in a larger host. Early data from clinical trials with DNA vaccines delivered by in vivo EP are cautiously promising. Thus, we may be entering a new era of DNA vaccination where we start to see clinical effects in humans; however, these may also be accompanied by side effects, as the vaccines become more effective.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36680212": "Measles is a highly contagious, but vaccine-preventable disease caused by the measles virus (MeV). Although the administration of two doses of measles vaccines is the most effective strategy to prevent and eliminate measles, MeV continues to spread worldwide, even in 2022. In measles-eliminated countries, preparedness and response to measles outbreaks originating from imported cases are required to maintain elimination status. Under these circumstances, real-time reverse transcription (RT) PCR for MeV could provide a diagnostic method capable of strengthening the subnational capacity for outbreak responses. Real-time RT-PCR can detect MeV RNA from patients with measles at the initial symptomatic stage, which can enable rapid public health responses aimed at detecting their contacts and common sources of infection. Furthermore, low cycle threshold (Ct) values (i.e., high viral load) of throat swabs indicate high infectiousness in patients with measles. The high basic reproduction number of measles suggests that patients with high infectiousness can easily become super-spreaders. This opinion proposes a possible strategy of rapid and intensive responses to counter measles outbreaks caused by super-spreader candidates showing low Ct values in throat swabs.

Complications of measles affect most organ systems, with pneumonia accounting for most measles-associated morbidity and mortality. The management of patients with measles includes provision of vitamin A. Measles is best prevented through vaccination, and the major reductions in measles incidence and mortality have renewed interest in regional elimination and global eradication.

A resurgence in measles cases was already occurring before the COVID-19 pandemic, which has affected global immunisation programmes, resulting in millions of children, mostly in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs), missing out on their measles vaccine. This will leave many children living in the most vulnerable of circumstances highly susceptible to measles and RSV infections when current COVID-19 public health control measures are lifted.

Eradication of measles is feasible because of several key attributes, including humans as the only reservoir for the virus, broad access to diagnostic tools that can rapidly detect measles-infectious persons, and availability of highly safe and effective measles-containing vaccines (MCVs). All 6 World Health Organization (WHO) regions have established measles elimination goals. Globally, during 2000-2018, measles incidence decreased by 66% (from 145 to 49 cases per million population) and deaths decreased by 73% (from 535 600 to 142 300), drastically reducing global disease burden. Routine immunization with MCV has been the cornerstone for the control and prevention of measles. Two doses of MCV are 97% effective in preventing measles, qualifying MCV as one of the most effective vaccines ever developed. Mild adverse events occur in <20% of recipients and serious adverse events are extremely rare. The economic benefits of measles vaccination are highlighted by an overall return on investment of 58 times the cost of the vaccine, supply chains, and vaccination. Because measles is one of the most contagious human diseases, maintenance of high (\u226595%) 2-dose MCV coverage is crucial for controlling the spread of measles and successfully reaching measles elimination; however, the plateauing of global MCV coverage for nearly a decade and the global measles resurgence during 2018-2019 demonstrate that much work remains.

The method was based on a rapid extraction protocol from 50 \u03bcL human plasma and separation on a reversed-phase C-18 HPLC column after the addition of deuterated internal standards. Accurate analyte quantification using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) detection was then obtained using a Thermofisher Quantiva triple-quadrupole MS coupled to an Ultimate 3000 UHPLC. The method has been validated following international (EMA) guidelines for bioanalytical method validation and has been tested on plasma samples from 62 CF patients treated with the three-drug combination IVA/TEZ/ELX, marketed as Kaftrio\u00ae or Trikafta\u00ae, in steady-state condition. The assay was linear over wide concentration ranges (0.008-12 mg/L) in plasma for IVA, TEZ, and ELX, suitable for a broad range of plasma concentrations, and accurate and reproducible in the absence of matrix effects. The stability of analytes for at least 30 days at room temperature could allow for cost-effective shipment and storage. On the same day of sample collection, a sweat test was evaluated for 26 associated patients' samples, FEV1 (%) for 58, and BMI was calculated for 62. However, Spearman correlation showed no correlation between C<sub>through</sub> plasma concentrations of analytes (IVA, TEZ, ELX) and sweat test, FEV1 (%), or BMI. Our method proved to be suitable for TDM and could be helpful in assessing dose-concentration-response correlations in larger studies.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34026156": "We present a novel case of an urticaria multiforme-type drug reaction to the new cystic fibrosis medication Trikafta (elexacaftor + tezacaftor + ivacaftor).

Healthcare systems face significant challenges in integrating these treatments, with uncertainty in prevalence and optimal testing methods to identify eligible patients. We performed a systematic review of NTRK fusion prevalence to inform efficient diagnostic screening and scale of therapeutic uptake. We searched Medline, Embase and Cochrane databases on 31/03/2021. Inclusion criteria were studies reporting fusion rates in solid tumours, English language, post-2010 publication and minimum sample size. Critical appraisal was performed using a custom 11-item checklist. Rates were collated by cancer type and pooled if additional synthesis criteria were met. 160 studies were included, with estimates for 15 pan-cancer and 429 specific cancer types (63 paediatric). Adult pan-cancer estimates ranged 0.03-0.70%, with higher rates found in RNA-based assays. In common cancers, rates were consistently below 0.5%. Rare morphological subtypes, colorectal microsatellite instability, and driver mutation exclusion cancers had higher rates. Only 35.6% of extracted estimates used appropriate methods and sample size to identify NTRK fusions. NTRK fusion-positive cancers are rare and widely distributed across solid tumours.

Binding of neurotrophins to TRK proteins induces receptor dimerization, phosphorylation, and activation of the downstream signaling cascades via PI3K, RAS/MAPK/ERK, and PLC-gamma. TRK pathway aberrations, including gene fusions, protein overexpression, and single nucleotide alterations, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of many cancer types, with NTRK gene fusions being the most well validated oncogenic events to date. Although the NTRK gene fusions are infrequent in most cancer types, certain rare tumor types are predominately driven by these events. Conversely, in more common histologies, such as lung and colorectal cancers, prevalence of the NTRK fusions is well below 5%. Selective inhibition of TRK signaling may therefore be beneficial among patients whose tumors vary in histologies, but share underlying oncogenic NTRK gene alterations. Currently, several TRK-targeting compounds are in clinical development. The ongoing Phase 2 trials with entrectinib and LOXO-101, two of the leading TRK inhibitors, are designed as 'basket trials', inclusive of patients whose tumors harbor NTRK gene fusions, independent of histology. Additional Phase 1 studies of other TRK inhibitors, including MGCD516, PLX7486, DS-6051b, and TSR-011, are underway. Interim data examining NTRK-rearranged tumors treated with entrectinib or LOXO-101 demonstrate encouraging activity, with patients achieving rapid and durable responses.

Limited data exist on the overall survival (OS) of patients with tumors with NTRK gene fusions and on the co-occurrence of NTRK fusions with other oncogenic drivers.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included patients enrolled in the Genomics England 100,000 Genomes Project who had linked clinical data from UK databases. Patients who had undergone tumor whole genome sequencing between March 2016 and July 2019 were included. Patients with and without NTRK fusions were matched. OS was analyzed along with oncogenic alterations in ALK, BRAF, EGFR, ERBB2, KRAS, and ROS1, and tumor mutation burden (TMB) and microsatellite instability (MSI).\nRESULTS: Of 15,223 patients analyzed, 38 (0.25%) had NTRK gene fusions in 11 tumor types, the most common were breast cancer, colorectal cancer (CRC), and sarcoma. Median OS was not reached in both the NTRK gene fusion-positive and -negative groups (hazard ratio 1.47, 95% CI 0.39-5.57, P\u00a0=\u00a00.572). A KRAS mutation was identified in two (5%) patients with NTRK gene fusions, and both had hepatobiliary cancer. High TMB and MSI were both more common in patients with NTRK gene fusions, due to the CRC subset. While there was a higher risk of death in patients with NTRK gene fusions compared to those without, the difference was not statistically significant.\nCONCLUSION: This study supports the hypothesis that NTRK gene fusions are primary oncogenic drivers and the co-occurrence of NTRK gene fusions with other oncogenic alterations is rare.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34402529": "Neurotrophic tropomyosin receptor kinase (NTRK) gene fusions are emerging tissue-agnostic drug targets in malignancies including colorectal carcinomas (CRCs), but their detailed landscape in the context of various colorectal carcinogenesis pathways remains to be investigated. In this study, pan-tropomyosin receptor kinase (TRK) protein expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in retrospectively collected colorectal epithelial tumor tissues, including 441 CRCs [133 microsatellite instability-high (MSI-high) and 308 microsatellite stable (MSS)] and 595 premalignant colorectal lesions (330 serrated lesions and 265 conventional adenomas). TRK-positive cases were then subjected to next-generation sequencing and/or fluorescence in situ hybridization to confirm NTRK rearrangements. TRK IHC positivity was not observed in any of the MSS CRCs, conventional adenomas, traditional serrated adenomas, or hyperplastic polyps, whereas TRK positivity was observed in 11 of 58 (19%) MLH1-methylated MSI-high CRCs, 4 of 23 (17%) sessile serrated lesions with dysplasia (SSLDs), and 5 of 132 (4%) sessile serrated lesions (SSLs). The 11 TRK-positive MSI-high CRCs commonly harbored CpG island methylator phenotype-high (CIMP-high), MLH1 methylation, BRAF/KRAS wild-type, and NTRK1 or NTRK3 fusion (TPM3-NTRK1, TPR-NTRK1, LMNA-NTRK1, SFPQ-NTRK1, ETV6-NTRK3, or EML4-NTRK3). Both NTRK1 or NTRK3 rearrangement and BRAF/KRAS wild-type were detected in all nine TRK-positive SSL(D)s, seven of which demonstrated MSS and/or CIMP-low. TRK expression was selectively observed in distorted serrated crypts within SSLs and was occasionally localized at the base of serrated crypts. NTRK fusions were detected only in SSLs of patients aged \u226550\u2009years, whereas BRAF mutation was found in younger age-onset SSLs. In conclusion, NTRK-rearranged colorectal tumors develop exclusively through the serrated neoplasia pathway and can be initiated from non-dysplastic SSLs without BRAF/KRAS mutations prior to full occurrence of MSI-high/CIMP-high. \u00a9 2021 The Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

Development of new monoclonal antibodies targeting one or a few single cytokines, including anti-tumor necrosis factor agents, anti-IL 12/23 inhibitors, and anti-\u03b14\u03b27 integrin inhibitors, have dominated the pharmacological armamentarium in IBD in the last 20 years. Still, many patients experience incomplete or loss of response or develop serious adverse events and drug discontinuation. Janus kinase (JAK) is key to modulating the signal transduction pathway of several proinflammatory cytokines directly involved in gastrointestinal inflammation and, thus, probably IBD pathogenesis. Targeting the JAK-STAT pathway offers excellent potential for the treatment of IBD. The European Medical Agency has approved three JAK inhibitors for treating adults with moderate to severe Ulcerative Colitis when other treatments, including biological agents, have failed or no longer work or if the patient cannot take them. Although there are currently no approved JAK inhibitors for Crohn's disease, upadacitinib and filgotinib have shown increased remission rates in these patients.

The RNAseq colon tissue data from clinical studies of TNF-IR Crohn's disease patients treated with upadacitinib or risankizumab were used to identify TNF-IR mechanisms that were favorably modified by upadacitinib and risankizumab.\nRESULTS: We found 7 TNF-IR upregulated modules related to innate/adaptive immune responses, interferon signaling, and tissue remodeling and 6 TNF-IR upregulated cell types related to inflammatory fibroblasts, postcapillary venules, inflammatory monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, and cycling B cells. Upadacitinib was associated with a significant decrease in the expression of most TNF-IR upregulated modules in JAK1 responders (JAK1-R); in contrast, there was no change in these modules among TNF-IR patients treated with a placebo or among JAK1 inadequate responders (JAK1-IR). In addition, 4 of the 6 TNF-IR upregulated cell types were significantly decreased after upadacitinib treatment in JAK1-R but not among subjects treated with a placebo or among JAK1-IR patients.

Tofacitinib, a non-selective small molecule JAK inhibitor, and\u00a0upadacitinib and filgotinib, which are selective JAK-1 inhibitors, have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for moderate-to-severe active ulcerative colitis. Compared to biological drugs, JAK inhibitors have a short half-life, rapid onset of action, and no immunogenicity. Both clinical trials and real-world evidence support the use of JAK inhibitors in the treatment of IBD. However, these therapies have been linked with multiple adverse events (AEs) including infection, hypercholesterolemia, venous thromboembolism, major adverse cardiovascular events, and malignancy. While early studies recognized several potential AEs, post-marketing trials have shown that tofacitinib may increase the risk of thromboembolic diseases and major cardiovascular events. The latter are seen in patients aged 50 years or older with cardiovascular risk factors. Hence, the\u00a0benefits of treatment and risk stratification need to be considered when positioning tofacitinib.

Resected mesenteric lymph node [MLN] cells from 19 patients [9 CD, 10 UC] were analysed by flow cytometry in the presence or absence of different cytokine stimuli and titrated JAKinibs.\nRESULTS: We found a higher potency of the JAK 1/3-preferential inhibitor, tofacitinib, for JAK 3-dependent cytokine signalling pathways in comparison to filgotinib, but a higher potency of the JAK 1-preferential inhibitors, filgotinib and upadacitinib, for JAK 3-independent cytokine signalling pathways. Deucravacitinib, a TYK2-preferential inhibitor, demonstrated a much narrower selectivity by inhibiting only IL-10 and IFN-\u03b2 pathways, albeit more potently than the other JAKinibs. Additionally, we found some differences in the sensitivity of immune cells from CD versus UC, and patients with versus without a CD-associated NOD2 polymorphism, to phosphorylate signal transducer and activator of transcriptions in response to specific cytokine stimulation.\nCONCLUSIONS: Despite their similarities, differences exist in the relative potencies of different JAKinibs against distinct cytokine families, to explain their clinical efficacy.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37365258": "In areas of moderate to intense Plasmodium falciparum transmission, malaria in pregnancy remains a significant cause of low birth weight, stillbirth, and severe anaemia.

Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps were generated, with values from 5 healthy individuals serving as controls.\nRESULTS: Patients with SNCM had a wide spectrum of cerebral ADC values, including both decreased and increased values compared with controls. Patients with low ADC values, indicating cytotoxic edema, showed hypoxic patterns similar to cerebral malaria despite the absence of deep coma. Conversely, high ADC values, indicative of mild vasogenic edema, were observed in both patients with SNCM and patients with UM. Brain involvement was confirmed by elevated circulating levels of S100B. Creatinine was negatively correlated with ADC in SNCM, suggesting an association between acute kidney injury and cytotoxic brain changes.\nCONCLUSIONS: Brain involvement is common in adults with SNCM and a subgroup of hospitalized patients with UM, which warrants closer neurological follow-up.

BAFF is an instrumental cytokine for the development and maintenance of B cells.

DMD is a rare disease that worsens over time. People with DMD experience inflammation in their muscles and muscle loss over time. They also experience bone problems such as an abnormally bent spine, also known as scoliosis, as well as heart and lung problems.\nWHAT HAPPENED IN THE CINCINNATI STUDY?: Prednisone and deflazacort are steroids that help to reduce muscle inflammation and are used as treatments for DMD. The study researchers wanted to further understand the differences between using prednisone and deflazacort in males with DMD by reviewing data from past medical records of patients seen in clinics rather than in clinical studies.

Despite the phenomenal advances made in the understanding of the molecular genetics of the disease, no definitive cure has been found. Of all of the therapeutic drugs studied in Duchenne muscular dystrophy, only prednisone seems to have the potential for providing interim functional improvement for boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy while they wait for a cure with gene or cell therapy. There is still no consensus regarding recommending corticosteroids as standard therapy for boys. This is an evidence-based review of all of the studies of corticosteroids (prednisone, deflazacort, and oxandrolone) in Duchenne muscular dystrophy. From this review, it is clear that until a definitive treatment for Duchenne muscular dystrophy is available, the use of deflazacort and prednisone with judicious dietary control and close clinical monitoring for side effects seems the best intervention for interim preservation of function in such a common devastating disorder of young growing boys.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36411210": "INTRODUCTION: Chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapies have revolutionized the treatment paradigm for heavily pretreated B-cell malignancies such as large B-cell lymphoma. There is a major unmet need for effective treatments for heavily pretreated relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM), for which many CAR-T therapies are under active clinical investigation. Goal of the review: This review provides an overview of recently updated clinical trial data and indirect treatment comparison analyses regarding two clinically advanced CAR-T therapies, idecabtagene vicleucel (ide-cel) and ciltacabtagene autoleucel (cilta-cel).\nDISCUSSION: Recently presented data after prolonged follow-up periods for ide-cel (KarMMa) and cilta-cel (CARTITUDE-1) have demonstrated that both therapies have the potential to elicit responses in individuals with heavily pretreated RRMM. Indirect treatment comparisons between cilta-cel and ide-cel suggest cilta-cel is associated with deeper and more durable responses than ide-cel in triple class-exposed RRMM; however, these types of comparisons have limitations and direct head-to-head trials are needed to confirm these findings. Additional indirect treatment comparisons conducted separately for ide-cel and cilta-cel have demonstrated that these CAR-T therapies hold promise for substantial clinical benefit relative to currently available treatments for RRMM. Further considerations, including safety profiles and real-world treatment considerations, are also discussed.\nCONCLUSION: Data collected to date support CAR-T therapies holding substantial promise for patients with heavily pretreated RRMM relative to other currently available therapies.

All the patients had received one to three previous lines of treatment. The primary outcome was progression-free survival.\nRESULTS: A total of 419 patients underwent randomization (208 to receive cilta-cel and 211 to receive standard care). At a median follow-up of 15.9 months (range, 0.1 to 27.3), the median progression-free survival was not reached in the cilta-cel group and was 11.8 months in the standard-care group (hazard ratio, 0.26; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.18 to 0.38; P<0.001).

However, not all individuals with colonic adenomas have a risk of CRC substantially higher than those of the general population. The aim of the study was to determine the differences or similarities of mutation profile among low- and high-grade adenomas and in situ carcinoma with detailed follow up. We have investigated the mutation spectrum of well-known genes involved in CRC (such as APC, BRAF, EGFR, NRAS, KRAS, PIK3CA, POLE, POLD1, SMAD4, PTEN, and TP53) in a large, well-defined series of 96 adenomas and in situ carcinomas using a high-throughput genotyping technique. Besides, the microsatellite instability and APC and MLH1 promoter methylation were studied as well. We observed a high frequency of pathogenic variants in the studied genes. The APC, KRAS and TP53 mutation frequencies were slightly lower in adenoma samples than in in situ carcinoma samples. Further, when we stratified mutation frequency based on the grade, the frequency distribution was as follows: low-grade adenoma-high-grade adenomas-in situ carcinoma: APC gene 42.9-56.0-54.5%; KRAS gene 32.7-32.0-45.5%; TP53 gene 8.2-20.0-18.2%. The occurrence of KRAS mutation was associated with the presence of villous histology and methylation of the APC promoter was significantly associated with the presence of POLE genetic variations. However, no association was noticed with the presence of any singular mutation and occurrence of subsequent adenoma or CRC.

Recently, molecular abnormalities underlying the adenomacarcinoma progression have been defined. The adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene and mismatch repair genes are found to be dysfunctional early in the neoplastic process; either as inherited or somatic mutations. Subsequently, polyps progress to cancer along one of two paths depending on which gene is abnormal. When the APC gene is the initial mutation tumor development follows the \"loss of heterozygocity\" (LOH) pathway. If mismatch repair genes are altered, the \"replication error\" (RER) pathway is followed. Somatic mutations of the K-ras oncogene and the MCC, DCC, and p53 tumor suppressor genes accumulate in the LOH pathway and mark the progression through polyp stages. Microsatellite instability is a characteristic of the RER pathway but the precise genes involved in this pathway currently are not known.

We analyzed the mutation profile and copy number changes of 25 adenomas and adjacent mucosa from 12 familial adenomatous polyposis patients using whole-exome sequencing and validated allelic imbalances (AI) in 37 adenomas using SNP arrays. We assessed for evidence of clonality and performed estimations on the proportions of driver and passenger mutations using a systems biology approach. Adenomas had lower mutational rates than did colorectal cancers and showed recurrent alterations in known cancer driver genes (APC, KRAS, FBXW7, TCF7L2) and AIs in chromosomes 5, 7, and 13. Moreover, 80% of adenomas had somatic alterations in WNT pathway genes. Adenomas displayed evidence of multiclonality similar to stage I carcinomas. Strong correlations between mutational rate and patient age were observed in at-risk mucosa and adenomas. Our data indicate that at least 23% of somatic mutations are present in at-risk mucosa prior to adenoma initiation. The genomic profiles of at-risk mucosa and adenomas illustrate the evolution from normal tissue to carcinoma via greater resolution of molecular changes at the inflection point of premalignant lesions.

The DNA of the carcinomatous cells frequently has mutations in several genes. However, it is not exactly clear when during the neoplastic process each mutation develops. An adenoma with an area of in situ carcinoma provides an opportunity to evaluate genetic changes within a single neoplasia whose separate areas are comprised of both the benign adenoma as well as the malignant carcinoma.\nMETHODS: Thirty-seven neoplasms with areas of both benign adenoma and in situ carcinoma were studied. Both portions were evaluated for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene and for mutations in codons 12/13 of the K-ras oncogene using the polymerase chain reaction technique.\nRESULTS: Twenty-eight neoplasms showed no LOH in either portion whereas both portions of 4 neoplasms revealed a loss of heterozygosity. In three lesions the APC gene was normal in the adenomatous portion but LOH was present in the carcinomatous portion. Two neoplasms were uninformative for LOH of the APC gene. Thirteen neoplasms showed the wild-type pattern for the K-ras oncogene whereas 15 contained the identical mutation in both portions. Of the remaining nine neoplasms, six had a K-ras mutation in the adenomatous portion only and three had one pattern in the adenomatous portion and a different pattern in the in situ carcinoma portion.\nCONCLUSIONS: LOH of the APC gene is an early and persistent feature in the evolution of a benign colorectal adenoma into an in situ carcinoma.

The cancers were further evaluated for mucinous status and microsatellite instability. Standard PCR molecular techniques were used for KRAS and microsatellite analyses. A KRAS mutation was found in 61.9% of 134 adenomas, 67.8% of 84 in situ carcinomas, and just 31.6% of 171 carcinomas. Our study clearly demonstrates that tubulovillous and villous adenomas, as well as both the benign and malignant parts of in situ carcinomas, are statistically more likely to contain a somatic KRAS gene mutation than colorectal carcinomas. This difference is confined to the non-mucinous and the microsatellite stable tumors.

As such, the structure and characteristics of food systems can be considered key determinants of modern pandemic risks. This means that emerging infectious diseases should be more explicitly addressed in the discourse of food systems to mitigate the likelihood and impacts of spillover events. Here, we adopt a scenario framework to highlight the many connections among food systems, zoonotic diseases, and sustainability. We identify two overarching dimensions: the extent of land use for food production and the agricultural practices employed that shape four archetypal food systems, each with a distinct risk profile with respect to zoonotic spillovers and differing dimensions of sustainability. Prophylactic measures to curb the emergence of zoonotic diseases are therefore closely linked to diets and food policies.

Interspecies contacts and host populations vary with the proportion of land converted; enabling us to quantify infection risk across a changing landscape. In a range of scenarios, the highest spillover risk occurs at intermediate levels of habitat loss, whereas the largest, but rarest, epidemics occur at extremes of land conversion.

Regions of high predicted bat coronavirus prevalence coincide with global disease hotspots, suggesting that infection prevalence in wildlife may be an important factor underlying links between human land modification and zoonotic disease emergence.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33052311": "The health and economic impacts of infectious disease pandemics are catastrophic as most recently manifested by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The emerging infections that lead to substantive epidemics or pandemics are typically zoonoses that cross species boundaries at vulnerable points of animal-human interface. The sharing of space between wildlife and humans, and their domesticated animals, has dramatically increased in recent decades and is a key driver of pathogen spillover. Increasing animal-human interface has also occurred in concert with both increasing globalisation and failing health systems, resulting in a trifecta with dire implications for human and animal health. Nevertheless, to date we lack a geographical description of this trifecta that can be applied strategically to pandemic prevention. This investigation provides the first geographical quantification of the intersection of animal-human interfaces, poor human health system performance and global connectivity via the network of air travel. In so doing, this work provides a systematic, data-driven approach to classifying spillover hazard based on the distribution of animal-human interfaces while simultaneously identifying globally connected cities that are adjacent to these interfaces and which may facilitate global pathogen dissemination. We present this geography of high-impact spillover as a tool for developing targeted surveillance systems and improved health infrastructure in vulnerable areas that may present conduits for future pandemics.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35656052": "BACKGROUND: Pain assessment in unconscious patients is a major challenge for healthcare providers. This study aims to compare the diagnostic value of the critical-care pain observation tool (CPOT) and the behavioral pain scale (BPS) for pain assessment among unconscious patients.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted in 2019. Forty-five unconscious patients were selected randomly from four general intensive care units (ICUs) in the north of Iran. The discriminant validity of CPOT and BPS were evaluated for pain during a nociceptive and a nonnociceptive procedure. For reliability assessment, interrater agreement was obtained using Lin's concordance correlation coefficient and weighted kappa coefficient.\nRESULTS: Patients who had been hospitalized in ICU due to surgery or trauma (57.70%) or medical problems (42.30%) were studied. During the nociceptive procedure, the mean scores of CPOT and BPS and all their dimensions, except for the compliance with ventilator dimension, were significantly greater than the nonnociceptive procedure (p &lt;0.05) although the effect size of both instruments was small (0.32 vs 0.18). The Lin's concordance correlation coefficient in nonnociceptive and nociceptive procedures was respectively 0.67 and 0.62 for CPOT and 0.74 and 0.88 for BPS.\nCONCLUSION: CPOT and BPS have acceptable discriminant validity in differentiating nonnociceptive and nociceptive procedural pain although the effect size of CPOT is larger than that of BPS. Although both instruments have low reliability, the reliability of BPS is better.\nHOW TO CITE THIS ARTICLE: Nazari R, Froelicher ES, Nia HS, Hajihosseini F, Mousazadeh N.

PB_2016-02324].\nSETTING: A total of 49 ICU patients from cardiovascular, visceral and thoracic surgery and neurology and neurosurgery were recruited. Data from 24 patients were analyzed.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Three independent observers assessed pain with the BPS, the CPOT or ZOPA prior, during and after a potential painful nursing intervention. Tools were randomized concerning the pain management after each pain assessment. Frequency of nine additional pain indicating items from a previous qualitative, explorative study was calculated.\nRESULTS: ZOPA was positive in 32 of 33 measuring cycles (97.0%; 95%CI: 84.2-99.9%), followed by the CPOT (28/33 cycles, 84.8%; 95%CI: 68.1-94.9%) and the BPS (23/33 cycles, 67.0%; 95%CI: 51.3-84.4%). In 22/33 cycles all tools were concordant (66.7%; 95%CI: 48.2-82.0%). Analgesics were provided in 29 out of 33 cycles (87.9%; 95%CI: 71.8-96.6%). Additional pain indicating items were inconsistently reported.\nCONCLUSION: ZOPA is concordant with the BPS and the CPOT to indicate pain but detects pain earlier due to the low threshold value.

Many patients hospitalised in ICU are not able to speak and express their pain due to various causes, including mechanical ventilation, reduced consciousness, and administration of sedative drugs. Therefore, the use of observational and behavioural pain tools is recommended in this group of patients given their inability to express pain.\nAIM: To examine the existing observational and behavioural tools for assessment of in Nonverbal Intubated Critically Adult Patients after Open-Heart Surgery.\nMETHODS: A systematic review of available observational and behavioural tools for assessment of pain was undertaken using the COSMIN checklist. A literature search was conducted using the following databases: Ovid, Science Direct, Scopus, PubMed, and CINHAL databases, Google Scholar search engine as well as Persian resources Sid, Magiran, Iran doc, and IranMedex up to the end of 2017 were reviewed.\nRESULTS: A total of 47 studies that had examined five tools used in intensive care units after cardiac surgery in patients under mechanical ventilation were reviewed. Each of the five tools included behavioural and observational items, and only one tool had physiological items. All the tools had been evaluated regarding validity and reliability. In the three tools, sensitivity, specificity, responsiveness, and satisfaction were considered.\nCONCLUSION: Based on available evidence and investigations, CPOT and BPS tools have good validity and reliability to be used in pain assessment in Nonverbal Intubated Critically Adult Patients after Open-Heart Surgery.

Nearly 30% of patients experience pain at rest, while the percentage increases to 50% during nursing procedures. Pain in ICU patients can be divided into four categories: continuous ICU treatment-related pain/discomfort, acute illness-related pain, intermittent procedural pain and pre-existing chronic pain present before ICU admission. As daily nursing procedures and interventions performed in the ICU may be a potential source of pain, it is crucial to use simple pain monitoring tools. The assessment of pain intensity in ICU patients remains an everyday challenge for clinicians, especially in sedated, intubated and mechanically ventilated patients. Regular assessment of pain intensity leads to improved outcome and better quality of life of patients in the ICU and after discharge from ICU. The gold standard in pain evaluation is patient self-reporting, which is not always possible. Current research shows that the two tools best validated for patients unable to self-report pain are the Behavioral Pain Scale (BPS) and the Critical Care Pain Observation Tool (CPOT). Although international guidelines recommend the use of validated tools for pain evaluation, they underline the need for translation into a given language. The authors of this publication obtained an official agreement from the authors of the two behavioral scales - CPOT and BPS - for translation into Polish. Validation of these tools in the Polish population will aid their wider use in pain assessment in ICUs in Poland.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27833752": "BACKGROUND: Critically ill patients admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) may suffer from different painful stimuli, but the assessment of pain is difficult because most of them are almost sedated and unable to self-report. Thus, it is important to optimize evaluation of pain in these patients. The main aim of this study was to compare two commonly used scales for pain evaluation: Critical Care Pain Observation Tool (CPOT) and Behavioral Pain Scale (BPS), in both conscious and unconscious patients. Secondary aims were (1) to identifying the most relevant parameters to determine pain scales changes during nursing procedures, (2) to compare both pain scales with visual analog scale (VAS), and (3) to identify the best combination of scales for evaluation of pain in patients unable to communicate.\nMETHODS: In this observational study, 101 patients were evaluated for a total of 303 consecutive observations during 3\u00a0days after ICU admission. Measurements with both scales were obtained 1\u00a0min before, during, and 20\u00a0min after nursing procedures in both conscious (n.41) and unconscious (n.60) patients; furthermore, VAS was recorded when possible in conscious patients only. We calculated criterion and discriminant validity to both scales (Wilcoxon, Spearman rank correlation coefficients). The accuracy of individual scales was evaluated. The sensitivity and the specificity of CPOT and BPS scores were assessed. Kappa coefficients with the quadratic weight were used to reflect agreement between the two scales, and we calculated the effect size to identify the strength of a phenomenon.\nRESULTS: CPOT and BPS showed a good criterion and discriminant validity (p\u2009&lt;\u20090.0001). BPS was found to be more specific (91.7 %) than CPOT (70.8 %), but less sensitive (BPS 62.7 %, CPOT 76.5 %). COPT and BPS scores were significantly correlated with VAS (p\u2009&lt;\u20090.0001). The combination of BPS and CPOT resulted in better sensitivity 80.4 %. Facial expression was the main parameter to determine pain scales changes effect size\u2009=\u20091.4.\nCONCLUSIONS: In critically ill mechanically ventilated patients, both CPOT and BPS can be used for assessment of pain intensity with different sensitivity and specificity.

Patients received 200 mg intravenous pembrolizumab once every 3 weeks plus 20 mg oral lenvatinib once per day for up to 2 years or until disease progression, development of unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent. The primary endpoint was objective response rate identified by a local investigator according to mRECIST version 1.1. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04287829, and is recruiting for the second cohort.\nFINDINGS: Between March 5, 2021, and Jan 31, 2022, 42 patients were screened, of whom 38 were included in the primary endpoint and safety analyses (median age 71 years [IQR 65-75], 33 [87%] male and five [13%] female) . At data cutoff (Jan 31, 2023), with a median follow-up of 17\u00b77 months (IQR 13\u00b78-19\u00b74), 22 (58%; 95% CI 41-74) of 38 patients had an objective response. The independent review showed an objective response in 17 (45%; 95% CI 29-62) of 38 patients. Serious treatment-related adverse events occurred in ten (26%) patients, including one treatment-related death due to myocardial infarction. The most common treatment-related grade 3 or worse adverse events were hypertension (eight patients [21%]) and anorexia and lymphopenia (both four patients [11%]). In 29 (76%) of 38 patients, at least one dose reduction or discontinuation of lenvatinib was required.\nINTERPRETATION: Pembrolizumab plus lenvatinib showed promising anti-tumour activity in patients with pleural mesothelioma with considerable toxicity, similar to that in previous studies. Available evidence from the literature suggests a high starting dose of lenvatinib for optimal anti-tumour activity. This, however, demands a high standard of supportive care.

This can contribute to disease through increasing carcinogenic metabolite/toxin production, inducing inflammation, and activating oncogenic signaling. To limit disease progression, external factors that may influence the colonic microbiota need to be considered in patients with colorectal cancer. One major factor that can influence the colonic microbiota is iron. Iron is an essential micronutrient that is required by both prokaryotes and eukaryotes for cellular function. Most pathogenic bacteria have heightened iron acquisition mechanisms and therefore tend to outcompete protective bacteria for free iron. Colorectal cancer patients often present with anemia due to iron deficiency, and thus they require iron therapy. Depending upon the route of administration, iron therapy has the potential to contribute to a procarciongenic microbiota. Orally administered iron is the common treatment for anemia in these patients but can lead to an increased gut iron concentration. This suggests the need to reassess the route of iron therapy in these patients. Currently, this has only been assessed in murine studies, with human trials being necessary to unravel the potential microbial outcomes of iron therapy.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24071482": "The host and microbiota have evolved mechanisms for coexistence over millions of years.

Many recent studies have attempted to define links between microbiota residents, their function and the development of colorectal cancer (CRC). Gut microbiota drive the development of inflammation within the colon and such inflammation is implicated in colonic neoplastic development. Although the precise mechanisms through which the microbiota is involved in cancer development remain elusive, the message is clear: the microbiota contributes to cancer risk by influencing a number of key host processes. It is also recognized that we have the ability to influence the role of the gut microbiota by considering our nutritional intake. We have always known that 'we are what we eat' but it is also true that 'they (our gut microbiota) are what we eat'. We therefore have a huge opportunity to positively influence our health through microbial manipulation. There is now a clear need to move past defining the constituents of the gastrointestinal microbiota and to focus more on understanding the functional capabilities of the resident microbial community and how this impacts on host health. One such emerging concept is the development of microbial biofilms which can form in the gut in conjunction with CRC tissue.

The rats were later submitted to 2-acetylaminofluorene treatment and partial hepatectomy, and placental glutathione S-transferase-positive liver foci were detected and quantified. The in vivo effects of carotenoids or of 3-MC on AFB1-induced liver DNA damage were evaluated using different endpoints: liver DNA single-strand breaks (SSB) induced by AFB1, and in vivo binding of [3H]AFB1 to liver DNA and plasma albumin. Finally, the modulation of AFB1 metabolism by carotenoids or by 3-MC was investigated in vitro by incubating [14C]AFB1 with liver microsomes from rats that had been fed with carotenoids or treated by 3-MC, and the metabolites formed by HPLC were analyzed. In contrast to lycopene or to an excess of vitamin A, both of which had no effect, beta-carotene, beta-apo-8'carotenal, astaxanthin and canthaxanthin, as well as 3-MC, were very efficient in reducing the number and the size of liver preneoplastic foci. In a similar way as 3-MC, the P4501A-inducer carotenoids, beta-apo-8'-carotenal astaxanthin and canthaxanthin, decreased in vivo AFB1-induced DNA SSB and the binding of AFB1 to liver DNA and plasma albumin, and increased in vitro AFB1 metabolism to aflatoxin M1, a less genotoxic metabolite. It is concluded that these carotenoids exert their protective effect through the deviation of AFB1 metabolism towards detoxication pathways.

Three indirect adherence measures were obtained at week 48: medication possession ratio (MPR), pill count and self-report (30-days recall). Tenofovir diphosphate (TFV-DP) concentration in Dried Blood Spot (DBS) was measured at week 48. Areas under (AUC) the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve were used to evaluate the concordance between achieving protective drug levels (TFV-DP\u2265700fmol/punch) and the indirect adherence measures. Youden's index and distance to corner were used to determine the optimal cutoff points for each indirect adherence measure. We calculated sensitivity, specificity, negative (NPV) and positive (PPV) predictive values for the found cutoff points. Finally, Delong test was used to compare AUCs.\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION: From April, 2014 to July, 2016, 450 participants initiated PrEP, 375(83.3%) were retained through 48 weeks. Of these, 74% (277/375) had TFV-DP \u2265700fmol/punch. All adherence measures discriminated between participants with and without protective drug levels (AUC>0.5). High indirect adherence measure was predictive of protective drug levels (PPV>0.8) while low indirect adherence measure was not predictive of lack of protective drug levels (NPV<0.5).

As such, genetically determined mitochondrial diseases may result from a molecular defect involving the mitochondrial or the nuclear genome. The first is characterized by maternal inheritance and the second by Mendelian inheritance. Ragged-red fibers (RRF) are commonly seen with primary lesions of mtDNA, but this association is not invariant. Conversely, RRF are seldom associated with primary lesions of nuclear DNA. Large-scale rearrangements (deletions and insertions) and point mutations of mtDNA are commonly associated with RRF and lactic acidosis, e.g. Kearns-Sayre syndrome (KSS) (major large-scale rearrangements), Pearson syndrome (large-scale rearrangements), myoclonus epilepsy with RRF (MERRF) (point mutation affecting tRNA(lys) gene), mitochondrial myopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) (two point mutations affecting tRNA(leu)(UUR) gene) and a maternally-inherited myopathy with cardiac involvement (MIMyCa) (point mutation affecting tRNA(leu)(UUR) gene). However, RRF and lactic acidosis are absent in Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) (one point mutation affecting ND4 gene, two point mutations affecting ND1 gene, and one point mutation affecting the apocytochrome b subunit of complex III), and the condition associated with maternally inherited sensory neuropathy (N), ataxia (A), retinitis pigmentosa (RP), developmental delay, dementia, seizures, and limb weakness (NARP) (point mutation affecting ATPase subunit 6 gene). The point mutations in MELAS, MIMyCa, and MERRF, and the large-scale mtDNA rearrangements in KSS and Pearson syndrome have a broader biochemical impact since these molecular defects involve the translational sequence of mitochondrial protein synthesis. The nuclear defects involving mitochondrial function generally are not associated with RRF. The biochemical classification of mitochondrial diseases principally catalogues these nuclear defects. This classification divides mitochondrial diseases into five categories. Primary and secondary deficiencies of carnitine are examples of a substrate transport defect. A lipid storage myopathy is often present. Disturbances of pyruvate or fatty acid metabolism are examples of substrate utilization defects. Only four defects of the Krebs cycle are known: fumarase deficiency, dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase deficiency, alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase deficiency, and combined defects of muscle succinate dehydrogenase and aconitase. Luft disease is the singular example of a defect in oxidation-phosphorylation coupling. Defects of respiratory chain function are manifold. Two clinical syndromes predominate, one involving limb weakness, and the other primarily affecting brain function. Leigh syndrome may result from different enzyme defects, most notably pyruvate dehydrogenase complex deficiency, cytochrome c oxidase deficiency, complex I deficiency, and complex V deficiency associated with the recently described NARP point mutation. A new group of mitochondrial diseases has emerged.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10443880": "Mutations of SURF-1, a gene located on chromosome 9q34, have recently been identified in patients affected by Leigh syndrome (LS), associated with deficiency of cytochrome c oxidase (COX), the terminal component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. To investigate to what extent SURF-1 is responsible for human disorders because of COX deficiency, we undertook sequence analysis of the SURF-1 gene in 46 unrelated patients. We analyzed 24 COX-defective patients classified as having typical Leigh syndrome (LS(COX)), 6 patients classified as Leigh-like (LL(COX)) cases, and 16 patients classified as non-LS(COX) cases. Frameshift, stop, and splice mutations of SURF-1 were detected in 18 of 24 (75%) of the LS(COX) cases. No mutations were found in the LL(COX) and non-LS(COX) group of patients. Rescue of the COX phenotype was observed in transfected cells from patients harboring SURF-1 mutations, but not in transfected cell lines from 2 patients in whom no mutations were detected by sequence analysis. Loss of function of SURF-1 protein is specifically associated with LS(COX), although a proportion of LS(COX) cases must be the result of abnormalities in genes other than SURF-1. SURF-1 is the first nuclear gene to be consistently mutated in a major category of respiratory chain defects. DNA analysis can now be used to accurately diagnose LS(COX), a common subtype of Leigh syndrome.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36237717": "Leigh syndrome or subacute necrotizing encephalomyelopathy is a rare, rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disorder. In general, symptoms such as shortness of breath and decreased cardiac function usually occur within 1 year of life. It is a serious disease with a mortality rate of 75% in 2-3 years. The cause of Leigh syndrome is DNA mutation. Approximately 75% of patients have nuclear DNA mutations while 25% have mitochondrial DNA mutations. Clinical symptoms vary depending on the affected brain area. Neuroimaging plays an important role in diagnosing patients with Leigh syndrome. Late-onset Leigh syndrome is rarer and progresses more slowly compared to the classic form. Here, we report a case of late-onset Leigh's syndrome mimicking Wernicke's encephalopathy.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35217561": "Variants in the mitochondrial genome can result in dysfunction of Complex I within the electron transport chain, thus causing disruptions in oxidative phosphorylation. Pathogenic variants in the MT-ND1 (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase core subunit 1) gene that result in Complex I dysfunction are a known cause of Leigh syndrome. The patient is a 4-yr-old female who initially presented with generalized tonic-clonic seizures, with other symptoms of Leigh syndrome becoming apparent after the seizures. A three-generation pedigree revealed no family history of mitochondrial disorders. Laboratory studies were remarkable for elevated blood lactate, alanine, and GDF15. T<sub>2</sub>-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed bilateral asymmetric signal hyperintensities in the basal ganglia, specifically in the bilateral putamen and right caudate. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy showed regionally elevated glucose and lactate. Mitochondrial respiratory chain enzyme analysis on skin fibroblasts demonstrated slightly reduced Complex I function. A 16-gene dystonia panel and chromosomal microarray analysis did not identify any disease-causing variants. Combined exome and mitochondrial genome sequencing identified the m.3685T &gt; C (MT-ND1 p.Tyr127His) variant with 62.3% heteroplasmy with no alternative cause for the patient's condition. Mitochondrial genome sequencing of the mother demonstrated that the m.3685T &gt; C variant occurred de novo. The m.3685T &gt; C variant is absent from population databases. The tyrosine 127 residue is highly conserved, and several nearby pathogenic variants in the MT-ND1 gene have been previously associated with Leigh syndrome. We propose that the m.3685T &gt; C variant is a novel mitochondrial DNA variant that causes Leigh syndrome, and we classify this variant as likely pathogenic based on currently available information.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35166475": "Primary melanocytic tumors of the central nervous system (CNS) are extremely rare and account for only 1% of all melanomas and 0.05% of primary brain tumors.

Cranial magnetic resonance imaging showed obvious brain atrophy with bilateral extensive meningeal enhancement in the supratentorial region. Diffusion-weighted imaging and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery showed slightly hyperintensive signals in the cortex. Microscopic examination revealed invasion of pigment into the Virchow-Robin space and cortex. Immunohistochemical examination of biopsy samples showed that cells were immunopositive for HMB45 and S-100 and immunonegative for melan-A with a Ki-67-positive percentage of 3%. No obvious atypia or nuclear mitosis was observed. Pathohistologic results of biopsied meninges confirmed the diagnosis of diffuse meningeal melanomatosis.

We sought to\u00a0determine the contribution of differences in insurance, comorbidities, tumor characteristics, and treatment receipt to disparities in black vs white patients with CRC 18-64 years old.\nMETHODS: We used data from the National Cancer Database, a hospital-based cancer registry database sponsored by the American College of Surgeons and the American Cancer\u00a0Society, on non-Hispanic black (black) and non-Hispanic white (white) patients, 18-64 years old, diagnosed from 2004 through 2012 with single or first primary invasive stage I-IV CRC. Each black patient was matched, based on demographic, insurance, comorbidity, tumor, and treatment features, with 5 white patients, from partially overlapping subgroups, using propensity score and greedy matching algorithms. We used the\u00a0Kaplan-Meier method to estimate 5-year survival and Cox\u00a0proportional hazards models to generate hazard ratios.\nRESULTS: The absolute 5-year survival difference between black and white unmatched patients with CRC was 9.2% (57.3% for black patients vs 66.5% for\u00a0white patients; P\u00a0<\u00a0.0001). The absolute difference in survival did not change after patient groups were matched for demographics, but decreased to 4.9% (47% relative decrease [4.3% of 9.2%]) when they were matched for insurance and to\u00a02.3% when they were matched for tumor characteristics (26% relative decrease [2.4% of 9.2%]). Further matching by treatment did not reduce\u00a0the difference in 5-year survival between black and white patients. In proportional hazards model, insurance and\u00a0tumor characteristics matching accounted for the 54% and 27% excess risk of death in black patients, respectively.\nCONCLUSIONS: In an analysis of data\u00a0from the National Cancer Database, we found that insurance coverage differences accounted for approximately one half of the disparity in survival rate of black vs white patients with CRC, 18-64 years old; tumor characteristics accounted for a quarter of the disparity. Affordable health insurance coverage for all populations could substantially reduce differences in survival times of black vs white patients with CRC.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24231453": "BACKGROUND: Black patients with metastatic colorectal cancer have inferior survival compared to white patients. The purpose of this study was to examine disparity in specialist consultation and multimodality treatment and the impact that treatment inequality has on survival.\nMETHODS: We identified 9935 non-Hispanic white and 1281 black patients with stage IV colorectal cancer aged 66 years and older from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare linked database. Logistic regression models identified race-based differences in consultation rates and subsequent treatment with surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation. Multivariable Cox regression models identified potential factors that explain race-based survival differences. All statistical tests were two-sided.\nRESULTS: Black patients had lower rates of consultation with surgery, medical oncology, and radiation oncology. Among patients seen in consultation, black patients received less surgery directed at the primary tumor, liver- or lung-directed surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. Unadjusted survival analysis found a 15% higher chance of dying for black patients compared with white patients (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.15; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.08 to 1.22; P < .001). Adjustment for patient, tumor, and demographic variables marginally reduced the risk of death (HR = 1.08; 95% CI = 1.01 to 1.15; P = .03). After adjustment for differences in treatment, the increased risk of death for black patients disappeared.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our study shows racial disparity in specialist consultation as well as subsequent treatment with multimodality therapy for metastatic colorectal cancer, and it suggests that inferior survival for black patients may stem from this treatment disparity.

Whites are more likely to adhere to screening guidelines. This is also the case among people with positive family history. Colorectal cancer is more frequent in Blacks. Studies have shown that that since 1985, colon cancer rates have dipped 20% to 25% for Whites, while rates have gone up for African-American men and stayed the same for African-American women. Overall, African-Americans are 38% to 43% more likely to die from colon cancer than are Whites. Furthermore, it seems that there is an African-American predominance in right-sited tumors. African Americans tend to be diagnosed at a later stage, to suffer from better differentiated tumors, and to have worse prognosis when compared with Whites. Moreover, less black patients receive adjuvant chemotherapy for resectable colorectal cancer or radiation therapy for rectal cancer. Caucasians seem to respond better to standard chemotherapy regimens than African-Americans. Concerning toxicity, it appears that patients of African-American descent are more likely to develop 5-FU toxicity than Whites, possibly because of their different dihydropyridine dehydrogenase status. Last but not least, screening surveillance seems to be higher among white than among black long-term colorectal cancer survivors. Socioeconomic and educational status account for most of these differences whereas little evidence exists for a genetic contribution in racial disparity. Understanding the nature of racial differences in colorectal cancer allows tailoring of screening and treatment interventions.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35176030": "BACKGROUND: Black patients and underinsured patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) present with more advanced disease and experience worse outcomes. The study aim was to evaluate the interaction of health insurance status and race with treatment and survival in metastatic CRC.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients diagnosed with metastatic CRC within NCDB from 2006-2016 were included. Primary outcomes included receipt of chemotherapy and 3-year all-cause mortality. Multivariable logistic regression and Cox-regression (MVR) including a two-way interaction term of race and insurance were performed to evaluate the differential association of race and insurance with receipt of chemotherapy and mortality, respectively.\nRESULTS: 128,031 patients were identified; 70.6% White, 14.4% Black, 5.7% Hispanic, and 9.3% Other race. Chemotherapy use was higher among White compared to Black patients. 3-year mortality rate was higher for Blacks and lower for Hispanics, in comparison with White patients. By MVR, Black patients were less likely to receive chemotherapy. When stratified by insurance status, Black patients with private and Medicare insurance were less likely to receive chemotherapy than White patients. All-cause mortality was higher in Black patients and lower in Hispanic patients, and these differences persisted after controlling for insurance and receipt of chemotherapy.\nCONCLUSION: Black patients and uninsured or under-insured patients with metastatic CRC are less likely to receive chemotherapy and have increased mortality.

Relatively few reports consider these mechanisms of colorectal cancer development across racial or ethnic groups. Available data indicate a moderate increase in colorectal cancer risk among Ashkenazi Jews who have a mutational polymorphism at codon 1307 in the APC gene. In American blacks, there is evidence for a higher prevalence of right-sided colonic tumors and an earlier age of onset of colorectal cancer. In addition, blacks have the highest colon cancer incidence in the United States among ethnic groups and have poorer 5-year survival rates compared with whites. While some differences may be attributed to health care access and socioeconomic differences, these do not completely explain all the variances. In the chromosomal instability pathway, there are polymorphisms within the P53 gene that are more prevalent in blacks, but the significance of these polymorphisms is not fully known. Blacks are more likely to demonstrate micro-satellite instability in their tumors; however, the mechanism for this phenomenon in blacks is unexplored. Differences in diet among racial and ethnic groups and polymorphic variations in drug metabolizing or acetylation genes have not been adequately cataloged.

Curcumin, as a traditional Chinese medicine extract with anti-tumor and anti-inflammatory effects, can affect the development of diverse human diseases including cancer. The aim of this research was to probe the mechanism by which curcumin regulates colon cancer progression. Colon cancer cells were processed with graded concentrations of curcumin. The proliferation and apoptosis of the treated cells were determined by MTT, colony formation assay and flow cytometry. Expression of signaling pathway-related proteins and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) was measured by western blotting. The effect of curcumin on tumor cell growth was verified through T cell-mediated killing and ELISA assays. The relationship between target gene expression and the survival rate of colon cancer patients was analyzed by a survival curve. Curcumin treatment restrained proliferation and accelerated apoptosis of colon cancer cells. It elevated miR-206 expression, which in turn affected colon cancer cell function. miR-206 enhanced colon cancer cell apoptosis and inhibited PD-L1 expression; thus, curcumin enhanced the killing effect of T cells on tumor cells by suppressing PD-L1 through inhibiting the JAK/STAT3 pathway. Patients with high expression of miR-206 had better survival rates than those with low expression. Curcumin can regulate miR-206 expression and inhibit the malignant behavior of colon cancer cells and enhance T cell killing through the JAK/STAT3 pathway.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36986483": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. The limitations of current chemotherapeutic drugs in CRC include their toxicity, side effects, and exorbitant costs. To assess these unmet needs in CRC treatment, several naturally occurring compounds, including curcumin and andrographis, have gained increasing attention due to their multi-targeted functionality and safety vs. conventional drugs. In the current study, we revealed that a combination of curcumin and andrographis exhibited superior anti-tumor effects by inhibiting cell proliferation, invasion, colony formation, and inducing apoptosis. Genome-wide transcriptomic expression profiling analysis revealed that curcumin and andrographis activated the ferroptosis pathway. Moreover, we confirmed the gene and protein expression of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX-4) and ferroptosis suppressor protein 1 (FSP-1), the two major negative regulators of ferroptosis, were downregulated by this combined treatment. With this regimen, we also observed that intracellular accumulation of reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxides were induced in CRC cells. These cell line findings were validated in patient-derived organoids. In conclusion, our study revealed that combined treatment with curcumin and andrographis exhibited anti-tumorigenic effects in CRC cells through activation of ferroptosis and by dual suppression of GPX-4 and FSP-1, which have significant potential implications for the adjunctive treatment of CRC patients.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37333486": "Curcumin is the most abundant derivative of turmeric rhizome. Although studies have proved that curcumin could inhibit the growth of tumors, its specific molecular mechanism has not yet been fully elucidated. This study aims to systematically elaborate the mechanisms of curcumin against hepatocellular carcinoma. The anti-tumor effect of curcumin was determined by the cell viability test. Flow cytometry was applied to examine the cell cycle and the apoptosis of cancer cells, and the cancer cell migration was detected by wound healing experiments. The expressions of signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) in cancer cells were examined by immunostaining and analyzed by the Image J analysis system. After treatment with curcumin, the apoptosis ratio of HepG2 cells increased significantly (P &lt; 0.05). The proliferation of cancer cells was arrested at the S-phase cell cycle, and the migration of cancer cells was inhibited by the increasing concentration of curcumin, together with the decreasing expressions of STAT3, VEGF, and HIF-1\u03b1 signaling pathways. The results indicate that curcumin could effectively inhibit the growth and migration of hepatocarcinoma cells by inducing cancer cell apoptosis, blocking the cancer cell cycle in the S phase, and reducing the expression of STAT3, VEGF, and HIF-1\u03b1 signaling pathways.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37210578": "Curcumin, a natural phytochemical isolated from tumeric roots, represents a candidate for prevention and therapy of colorectal cancer/CRC. However, the exact mechanism of action and the downstream mediators of curcumin's tumor suppressive effects have remained largely unknown. Here we used a genetic approach to determine the role of the p53/miR-34 pathway as mediator of the effects of curcumin. Three isogenic CRC cell lines rendered deficient for the p53, miR-34a and/or miR-34b/c genes were exposed to curcumin and subjected to cell biological analyses. siRNA-mediated inhibition and ectopic expression of NRF2, as well as Western blot, qPCR and qChIP analyses of its target genes were performed. CRC cells were i.v. injected into NOD/SCID mice and lung-metastases formation was determined by longitudinal, non-invasive imaging. In CRC cells curcumin induced apoptosis and senescence, and suppressed migration and invasion in a p53-independent manner. Curcumin activated the KEAP1/NRF2/ARE pathway by inducing ROS. Notably, curcumin induced miR-34a and miR-34b/c expression in a ROS/NRF2-dependent and p53-independent manner. NRF2 directly induced miR-34a and miR-34b/c via occupying multiple ARE motifs in their promoter regions. Curcumin reverted repression of miR-34a and miR-34b/c induced by IL6 and hypoxia. Deletion of miR-34a and miR-34b/c significantly reduced curcumin-induced apoptosis and senescence, and prevented the inhibition of migration and invasion by curcumin or ectopic NRF2. In CRC cells curcumin induced MET and prevented the formation of lung-metastases in mice in a miR-34a-dependent manner. In addition, we found that curcumin may enhance the therapeutic effects of 5-FU on CRC cells deficient for p53 and miR-34a/b/c. Activation of the KEAP1/NRF2/miR-34a/b/c axis mediates the tumor suppressive activity of curcumin and suggests a new approach for activating miR-34 genes in tumors for therapeutic purposes.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20426658": "The effectiveness of lung radiotherapy is limited by radiation tolerance of normal tissues and by the intrinsic radiosensitivity of lung cancer cells. The chemopreventive agent curcumin has known antioxidant and tumor cell radiosensitizing properties. Its usefulness in preventing radiation-induced pneumonopathy has not been tested previously. We evaluated dietary curcumin in radiation-induced pneumonopathy and lung tumor regression in a murine model. Mice were given 1% or 5% (w/w) dietary curcumin or control diet prior to irradiation and for the duration of the experiment. Lungs were evaluated at 3 weeks after irradiation for acute lung injury and inflammation by evaluating bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid content for proteins, neutrophils and at 4 months for pulmonary fibrosis. In a separate series of experiments, an orthotopic model of lung cancer using intravenously injected Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells was used to exclude possible tumor radioprotection by dietary curcumin. In vitro, curcumin boosted antioxidant defenses by increasing heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) levels in primary lung endothelial and fibroblast cells and blocked radiation-induced generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Dietary curcumin significantly increased HO-1 in lungs as early as after 1 week of feeding, coinciding with a steady-state level of curcumin in plasma. Although both 1% and 5% w/w dietary curcumin exerted physiological changes in lung tissues by significantly decreasing LPS-induced TNF-alpha production in lungs, only 5% dietary curcumin significantly improved survival of mice after irradiation and decreased radiation-induced lung fibrosis. Importantly, dietary curcumin did not protect LLC pulmonary metastases from radiation killing. Thus dietary curcumin ameliorates radiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis and increases mouse survival while not impairing tumor cell killing by radiation.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36564597": "PURPOSE: To investigate the long-term outcomes of cataract surgery for glaucoma management in patients with primary angle-closure disease (PACD).\nSTUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case series.\nMETHODS: We reviewed the medical records of 87 eyes of 87 patients with PACD who underwent uncomplicated cataract surgery alone at the Kobe City Medical Center General Hospital. Only patients with a minimum follow-up of 10 years were included. The patients were divided into PACD spectrum categories: primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG), primary-angle closure (PAC), and primary angle-closure suspect (PACS). The treatment outcomes were compared among the 3 groups. Intraocular pressure (IOP), number of glaucoma eye drops, requirement of additional glaucoma treatment, visual field progression, and progression to glaucoma during the follow-up period were evaluated.\nRESULTS: Among the 87 patients, 39 had PACG; 26, PAC; and 22, PACS. Ten years after surgery, the IOP had significantly decreased from baseline in all 3 groups. The rate of requirement of additional glaucoma treatment during the follow-up period was significantly higher in the PACG group than in the other groups. Almost half of the patients with PACG required additional glaucoma treatment; of those patients, six (15.4%) underwent glaucoma surgery. Three patients (11.5%) with PAC required additional glaucoma medication. Visual field progression was observed in 28.1% of the patients with PACG. In 1 patient with PAC, the condition progressed to PACG, but there was no such progression in any of the patients with PACS.\nCONCLUSIONS: We confirmed that cataract surgery had a long-term (>\u00a010 years) effect on IOP reduction in eyes with PACD.

Data included sex, age, laterality, type of glaucoma, cyclodiode parameters, number of glaucoma medications, visual acuity and treatment with acetazolamide. Data were analysed using generalised linear modelling and Kaplan-Meier analysis.\nRESULTS: A total of 54 eyes in 54 patients (29 M:25F) with a mean age of 66\u2009years (range 15-85\u2009years) with a minimum of 5\u2009years follow up were included. The mean number of burns was 23.3 (range 12-40) over 180-270 degrees, mean power per burn was 1967\u2009mW (range 1500-2000\u2009mW), with a mean duration of 1981\u2009ms (1500-2000\u2009ms). The mean pre-treatment IOP was 31.5\u2009mmHg (range 17-56\u2009mmHg) and mean IOP 5\u2009years post-treatment was 16.1\u2009mmHg (2-42\u2009mmHg).

Many patients with glaucoma are asymptomatic early in the disease course. Primary care clinicians should know which patients to refer to an eye care professional for a complete eye examination to check for signs of glaucoma and to determine what systemic conditions or medications can increase a patient's risk of glaucoma. Open-angle and narrow-angle forms of glaucoma are reviewed, including a description of the pathophysiology, risk factors, screening, disease monitoring, and treatment options.\nOBSERVATIONS: Glaucoma is a chronic progressive optic neuropathy, characterized by damage to the optic nerve and retinal nerve fiber layer, that can lead to permanent loss of peripheral or central vision. Intraocular pressure is the only known modifiable risk factor. Other important risk factors include older age, nonwhite race, and a family history of glaucoma. Several systemic medical conditions and medications including corticosteroids, anticholinergics, certain antidepressants, and topiramate may predispose patients to glaucoma. There are 2 broad categories of glaucoma, open-angle and angle-closure glaucoma. Diagnostic testing to assess for glaucoma and to monitor for disease progression includes measurement of intraocular pressure, perimetry, and optical coherence tomography. Treatment of glaucoma involves lowering intraocular pressure. This can be achieved with various classes of glaucoma medications as well as laser and incisional surgical procedures.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Vision loss from glaucoma can be minimized by recognizing systemic conditions and medications that increase a patient's risk of glaucoma and referring high-risk patients for a complete ophthalmologic examination. Clinicians should ensure that patients remain adherent with taking glaucoma medications and should monitor for adverse events from medical or surgical interventions used to treat glaucoma.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35647957": "The burden of irreversible vision loss from Glaucoma continues to rise. While the disease pathogenesis is not well understood, intraocular pressure (IOP) is the only modifiable risk factor identified to prevent glaucomatous vision loss. Medical management remains the first-line of treatment in most adult glaucomas and the evolution of medical therapy for glaucoma has followed an exponential curve. This review tracks the rapid development of new medications and drug delivery systems in the recent years. Introduction of Rho kinase inhibitors with an entirely new mechanism of action from that of the currently used anti glaucoma medications has been a significant milestone. Latanoprostene Bunod is a novel, single molecule which provides two active metabolites that work through two different pathways for reducing intra ocular pressure. Bimatoprost implants and travoprost punctum plugs attempt to ease chronic medication use in glaucoma patients. Nanotechnology is an evolving route of drug delivery. Role of cannabinoids in medical management of glaucoma remain equivocal. The relatively short term effect on IOP, the risks of developing tolerance and side effects impacting patients' neurocognitive health greatly outweigh the potential benefit. Research on Latrunculin B, Adenosine receptor agonists, Specific gene silencing and Stem cell therapy are poised to make an impact on glaucoma treatment.

Although the follow-up of glaucoma patients with single IOP measurements is quick and convenient, such measurements often do not adequately reflect the untreated IOP characteristics, or indeed the quality of treated IOP control during the 24-h cycle. Since glaucoma is a 24-h disease and the damaging effect of elevated IOP is continuous, it is logical that we should aim to understand the efficacy of all treatment options throughout the 24-h period. This article first reviews the concept and value of diurnal and 24-h IOP monitoring. It then critically evaluates selected available evidence on the 24-h efficacy of medical, laser and surgical therapy options. During the past decade several controlled trials have significantly enhanced our understanding on the 24-h efficacy of all glaucoma therapy options. Nevertheless, more long-term evidence is needed to better evaluate the 24-h efficacy of glaucoma therapy and the precise impact of IOP characteristics on glaucomatous progression and visual prognosis.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37355760": "Pegozafermin, a long-acting glycopegylated analog of human fibroblast growth factor 21, is in development for the treatment of severe hypertriglyceridemia (SHTG) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.

In a phase Ib/IIa placebo-controlled, double-blind, multiple ascending dose study in patients with NASH (NCT04048135), administration of pegozafermin resulted in clinically meaningful reductions in hepatic fat fraction (HFF), with a favorable safety and tolerability profile. We aimed to characterize the relationship between pegozafermin dosing, exposure and effects on HFF reduction. We used pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) modeling of data from the phase Ib/IIa study to identify model parameters and covariates affecting the exposure-response relationship. Clinical simulations were performed to help support dose selection for larger studies. Pegozafermin exposure was adequately described by a one compartment PK model, with one additional transit absorption compartment. PK/PD modeling demonstrated that HFF reduction was significantly related to pegozafermin exposure. HFF outcomes were correlated with average pegozafermin concentrations regardless of weekly dosing (q.w.) or dosing every 2\u2009weeks (q2w). The significant PK/PD model covariates included baseline body weight, alanine aminotransferase level, and liver volume. Simulations showed that the 30\u2009mg q.w. dose approximated the full PD effect; almost all patients would benefit from a greater than or equal to 30% HFF reduction, suggesting fibrosis regression. Furthermore, 44\u2009mg q2w dosing (~22\u2009mg q.w.) appeared to be an effective regimen for HFF reduction.

In diabetic monkeys, once-weekly and once-every-2-weeks regimens of subcutaneous pegozafermin provided rapid and robust benefits for an array of metabolic biomarkers, including triglycerides, cholesterol, fasting glucose, glycated hemoglobin, adiponectin, alanine aminotransferase, food intake, and body weight. In a single ascending dose study in healthy volunteers, subcutaneously administered pegozafermin was associated with statistically significant improvements in triglycerides, low- and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, and adiponectin, an insulin-sensitizing and anti-inflammatory adipokine. Pharmacokinetic half-lives ranged from 55 to 100 hours over the clinically relevant dose range, consistent with the expected half-life extension by glycoPEGylation.

Studies presented here demonstrate that a novel long-acting FGF21 analog, pegozafermin, has similar pharmacologic properties as FGF21 and that repeated, subcutaneous dosing of pegozafermin in diabetic monkeys and healthy humans improves lipid metabolism, glucose metabolism, weight, and liver transaminases.

The effects of PCSK9 antibodies on triglyceride metabolism are less pronounced. The present study aimed to investigate in detail the effects of alirocumab on triglycerides, triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, and lipase regulators.\nMETHODS: A total of 24 patients with an indication for treatment with PCSK9 antibodies were recruited. There were two visits at the study site: the first before initiation of treatment with alirocumab and the second after 10 weeks of treatment. Fat-tolerance tests, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were performed to analyze lipid metabolism.\nRESULTS: A total of 21 participants underwent the first and second investigation. Among these, two participants only received alirocumab twice and 19 patients completed the trial per protocol. All of them had atherosclerotic vascular disease. There was no significant effect of alirocumab treatment on fasting triglycerides, post-prandial triglycerides, or lipoprotein-lipase regulating proteins.

The aim of this work was to develop an integrated pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model to describe the interaction of alirocumab with PCSK9 and its impact on the evolution of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels and explore labeling specification for subpopulations.\nMETHODS: Using data collected from nine phase I/II/III clinical studies (n\u00a0=\u00a0527, subcutaneous or intravenous administration), a TMDD model considering the quasi-steady-state approximation was developed to characterize the interaction dynamics of alirocumab and PCSK9, combined with an indirect pharmacodynamic model describing the inhibition of LDL-C by PCSK9 in a one-step approach using nonlinear-mixed effects modeling. A \"full fixed effects modeling\" strategy was implemented to quantify parameter-covariate relationships.\nRESULTS: The model captures the interaction between alirocumab and its target PCSK9 and how this mechanism drives LDL-C depletion, with an estimation of the associated between-subject variability of model parameters and the quantification of clinically relevant parameter-covariate relationships. Co-administration of statins was found to increase the central volume of distribution of alirocumab by 1.75-fold (5.6\u00a0L versus 3.2\u00a0L) and allow for a 14% greater maximum lipid-lowering effect (88% versus 74%), highlighting the synergy of action between anti-PCSK9 therapeutic antibodies and statins toward lowering LDL-C plasma levels. Baseline levels of PCSK9 were found to be related to the amplitude of LDL-C variations by increasing the concentration of free PCSK9 necessary to reach half its capacity of inhibition of LDL-C degradation.\nCONCLUSION: The maximum effect of alirocumab is achieved when free PCSK9 concentration is close to zero, as seen mostly after 150\u00a0mg every 2\u00a0weeks (Q2W) or 300 mg every 4\u00a0weeks (Q4W), indicating that there would be no additional clinical benefit of increasing the dose higher than these recommended dosing regimens.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37018869": "The gram-negative bacterium Helicobacter pylori is the most common chronic bacterial infection and the main cause of gastric cancer.

The elimination of H. pylori is currently considered one of the most effective strategies for the treatment of gastric-related diseases, so antibiotic therapy is the most commonly used regimen for the treatment of H. pylori infection. Although this therapy has some positive effects, antibiotic resistance has become another clinically prominent problem. Therefore, the development of a safe and efficient vaccine has become an important measure to prevent H. pylori infection.\nMETHODS: PubMed and ClinicalTrials.gov were systematically searched from January 1980 to March 2023 with search terms-H. pylori vaccine, adjuvants, immunization, pathogenesis, and H. pylori eradication in the title and/or abstract of literature. A total of 5182 documents were obtained. Based on the principles of academic reliability, authority, nearly publicated, and excluded the similar documents, finally, 75 documents were selected, organized, and analyzed.\nRESULTS: Most of the candidate antigens used as H. pylori vaccines in these literatures are whole-cell antigens and virulence antigens such as UreB, VacA, CagA, and HspA, and the main types of vaccines for H. pylori are whole bacteria vaccines, vector vaccines, subunit vaccines, nucleic acid vaccines, epitope vaccines, etc. Some vaccines have shown good immune protection in animal trials; however, few vaccines show good in clinical trials.

The colonization of the stomach\u0301s gastric mucosa by H. pylori is related to the onset of chronic gastritis, peptic ulcer, and cancer. The estimated deaths from gastric cancer caused by this bacterial infection are in the 15,000-150,000 range. Current treatment for controlling the colonization of H. pylori includes the administration of two to four antibiotics and a gastric ATPase proton pump inhibitor. Nevertheless, the bacterium has shown increased resistance to antibiotics. Despite an extensive list of attempts to develop a vaccine, no approved vaccine against H. pylori is available.

We verified the expression of this hybrid multiepitopic protein in HeLa cells. Mice were inoculated with the recombinant baculovirus Bac-Thp1 using various administration routes: intranasal, intragastric, intramuscular, and a combination of intranasal and intragastric. We identified a strong adjuvant-independent IgG-antibody response in the serum of recombinant baculovirus-Thp1 inoculated mice, which was specific for a strain of H. pylori isolated from a human patient. The bacterium-specific IgG-antibodies were present in sera 125\u00a0days after the first vaccine administration. Also, H. pylori-specific IgA-antibodies were found in feces at 82\u00a0days after the first inoculation.

It is now recognized that H pylori is a chronic infection of the stomach causing inflammation.

However, the role of H pylori in contributing to nonulcer dyspepsia or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug gastropathy remains controversial. An effective vaccine against H pylori is years away.

In the frame of the studies aimed at finding alternative therapies or at increasing the efficacy of the current ones and/or reducing their side effects, the investigation on the use of probiotics plays an interesting role. In vitro and preclinical studies have shown the feasibility of this approach. Several clinical trials indicated that administration of probiotics can reduce the side effects of H. pylori eradication treatment, increasing tolerability, and often increases the overall efficacy. The results of these trials vary, likely reflecting the variety of probiotics assessed and that of the eradication treatment, as well as the differences in the geographic area that imply different H. pylori strains distribution, host susceptibility, and therapy efficacy.

Tebentafusp and combined immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) with ipilimumab plus anti-PD-1 antibodies are the most commonly used treatment options but their comparative efficacy is unclear. The aim of this study is to compare currently available systemic treatments regarding overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) with a focus on the comparison of tebentafusp versus combined ICB.\nMETHODS: The protocol for this study was defined a priori and registered online in the PROSPERO international prospective register of systematic reviews (CRD42022308356, date of registration: 7.2.2022). We performed a systematic literature search in Medline, Embase, and Central to identify eligible studies reporting Kaplan-Meier curves or individual-level survival data showing OS and PFS for metastatic uveal melanoma patients treated with systemic treatments. Kaplan-Meier curves were digitized using the \"WebPlotDigitizer\" program. Individual-level survival data were subsequently remodelled and pooled for distinct treatment groups. To compare the OS of tebentafusp versus combined ICB, we used matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC), two-stage MAIC (2SMAIC), and simulated treatment comparison (STC) together with digitized individual-level survival data as population-adjusted models.\nRESULTS: Overall, 55 independent studies were included of which 2,682 patients were evaluable for OS and 2,258 for PFS. Tebentafusp showed the highest median OS (mOS) of 22.4\u00a0months (95% confidence interval (CI): 19.9-29.6) compared to combined ICB (mOS: 15.7\u00a0months (95% CI: 14.4-17.9)), anti-PD-(L)1 antibody (mOS: 10.9\u00a0months (95% CI: 9.8-13.4)), chemotherapy (mOS: 9.95\u00a0months (95% CI: 8.9-11.2)), targeted therapies (mOS: 8.86\u00a0months (95% CI: 7.5-10.8)), and anti-CTLA-4 antibody (mOS: 7.8\u00a0months (95% CI: 6.8-9.3). The median PFS (mPFS) was similar among the treatment groups ranging from 2.7\u00a0months to 3.4\u00a0months. For the comparison of tebentafusp versus combined ICB, the hazard ratio (HR) was 0.641 (95% CI: 0.449-0.915) in the unadjusted model, whereas the population-adjusted models showed a HR of 0.386 (95% CI: 0.236-0.631) using MAIC, 0.378 (95% CI: 0.234-0.612) applying 2SMAIC and 0.284 (95% CI: 0.184-0.440) using STC.\nCONCLUSIONS: Tebentafusp achieved the best results compared to combined ICB and other systemic treatments, although these results have to be interpreted with caution due to the approximative methodical approach and high heterogeneity of included studies.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36970111": "Tebentafusp is a first-in-class immunotherapy agent that comprises an engineered T-cell receptor targeting a gp100 epitope presented by human leukocyte antigen-A*02:01 cells, fused to an anti-CD3 single-chain variable fragment.

Until January 2022, no systemic therapy had received regulatory approval for patients with metastatic uveal melanoma, and these patients have historically had a dismal prognosis owing to the limited efficacy of the available treatments. A series of seminal studies over the past two decades have identified highly prevalent early, tumour-initiating oncogenic genomic aberrations, later recurring prognostic alterations and immunological features that characterize uveal melanoma. These advances have driven the development of a number of novel emerging treatments, including tebentafusp, the first systemic therapy to achieve regulatory approval for this disease.

This report investigates putative exposure-symptom pathology by assembling a network model of published bio-behavioral pathways and assessing how dysregulation of such pathways might explain loss of function in these subjects using data available in the published literature. Given similarities in presentation with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), we used the latter as a clinically relevant means of evaluating if the neuropsychological profiles observed in Havana Syndrome Havana Syndrome might be explained at least in part by a dysregulation of neurotransmission, neuro-inflammation, or both.\nMETHOD: Automated text-mining of &gt;9,000 publications produced a network consisting of 273 documented regulatory interactions linking 29 neuro-chemical markers with 9 neuropsychological constructs from the Brief Mood Survey, PTSD Checklist, and the Frontal Systems Behavior Scale. Analysis of information flow through this network produced a set of regulatory rules reconciling to within a 6% departure known mechanistic pathways with neuropsychological profiles in N\u2009=\u20096 subjects.\nRESULTS: Predicted expression of neuro-chemical markers that jointly satisfy documented pathways and observed symptom profiles display characteristically elevated IL-1B, IL-10, NGF, and norepinephrine levels in the context of depressed BDNF, GDNF, IGF1, and glutamate expression (FDR\u2009<\u20095%). Elevations in CRH and IL-6 were also predicted unanimously across all subjects. Furthermore, simulations of neurological regulatory dynamics reveal subjects do not appear to be \"locked in\" persistent illness but rather appear to be engaged in a slow recovery trajectory.\nDISCUSSION: This computational analysis of measured neuropsychological symptoms in Havana-based diplomats proposes that these AHI symptoms may be supported in part by disruption of known neuroimmune and neurotransmission regulatory mechanisms also associated with mTBI.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35962646": "Since 2016, numerous American and Canadian diplomats and secret (intelligence) agents in Cuba, China, and other places in the world have experienced an abrupt onset of unusual clinical symptoms including, tinnitus, visual problems, vertigo, and cognitive difficulties, after they encountered strange sounds; this has been called \"Havana syndrome\" (HS).

At present, U.S. military medical personnel are not capable of adequately diagnosing or treating the injuries and illnesses that may result from exposure to potential neuroweapons. This fact was illustrated in 2016 when U.S. diplomats serving in Havana, Cuba reported hearing strange noises accompanied by a constellation of unexplained health effects. Similar incidents have been reported in China and Russia. Although various hypotheses have been put forward to explain these symptoms, none of them have been verified. The reported symptoms were analogous to the physiological responses that have been produced in the laboratory by exposing volunteers to pulsed microwave energy. However, these incidents of undetermined origin demonstrate that widespread neurological illness can be disruptive to U.S. government operations and that it is currently not possible to identify the cause, determine the correct treatment, or ascribe attribution to potential neuroweapon use in an overseas setting. Since it is likely that Special Operations medical personnel will be among the first to respond to neuroweapon attacks in the deployed environment, it is essential that they be made aware of this emerging threat and that efforts be made to incorporate potential directed energy neuroweapons and other neuroweapon configurations into future Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and high yield Explosives (CBRN-E) training modules.

In addition, the ways in which the typical causes of filovirus outbreaks differ from other zoonoses remain poorly described. In this study, we quantify factors associated with 45 outbreaks of African filoviruses (ebolaviruses and Marburg virus) using a rubric of 48 candidate causal drivers. For filovirus outbreaks, we reviewed &gt;700 peer-reviewed and gray literature sources and developed a list of the factors reported to contribute to each outbreak (i.e., a \"driver profile\" for each outbreak). We compare and contrast the profiles of filovirus outbreaks to 200 background outbreaks, randomly selected from a global database of 4463 outbreaks of bacterial and viral zoonotic diseases. We also test whether the quantitative patterns that we observed were robust to the influences of six covariates, country-level factors such as gross domestic product, population density, and latitude that have been shown to bias global outbreak data. We find that, regardless of whether covariates are included or excluded from models, the driver profile of filovirus outbreaks differs from that of background outbreaks. Socioeconomic factors such as trade and travel, wild game consumption, failures of medical procedures, and deficiencies in human health infrastructure were more frequently reported in filovirus outbreaks than in the comparison group.

Ebola and Marburg viruses are members of the Filoviridae family and easily distinguishable from viruses of other families by the characteristic morphology of the virion.

The current taxonomy has only been partially accepted by most laboratory virologists. Confusion likely arose for several reasons: species names that consist of several words or which (should) contain diacritical marks, the current orthographic identity of species and virus names, and the similar pronunciation of several virus abbreviations in the absence of guidance for the correct use of vernacular names. To rectify this problem, we suggest (1) to retain the current species names Reston ebolavirus, Sudan ebolavirus, and Zaire ebolavirus, but to replace the name Cote d'Ivoire ebolavirus [sic] with Ta\u00ef Forest ebolavirus and Lake Victoria marburgvirus with Marburg marburgvirus; (2) to revert the virus names of the type marburgviruses and ebolaviruses to those used for decades in the field (Marburg virus instead of Lake Victoria marburgvirus and Ebola virus instead of Zaire ebolavirus); (3) to introduce names for the remaining viruses reminiscent of jargon used by laboratory virologists but nevertheless different from species names (Reston virus, Sudan virus, Ta\u00ef Forest virus), and (4) to introduce distinct abbreviations for the individual viruses (RESTV for Reston virus, SUDV for Sudan virus, and TAFV for Ta\u00ef Forest virus), while retaining that for Marburg virus (MARV) and reintroducing that used over decades for Ebola virus (EBOV).

These candidate vaccines are currently being tested for immunogenicity and efficacy in nonhuman primates. Furthermore, the Ebola and Marburg VLPs are being used as a surrogate model to further understand the filovirus life cycle, with the goal of developing rationally designed vaccines and therapeutics.

Adverse birth outcomes (stillbirth, low birth weight (LBW), very LBW (VLBW)) and maternal outcomes (early and late pregnancy-related deaths, early and late hospitalizations) were compared by HIV/ART status and adjusted prevalence ratios (aPRs) calculated using log-binomial regression.\nRESULTS: Overall 171,960 pregnant people and their singleton newborns were included, 19% (N\u200a=\u200a32\u200a015) identified with HIV. Amongst pregnant people with HIV (PPHIV), 60% (N\u200a=\u200a19\u200a157) were on ART preconception, 29% (N\u200a=\u200a9276) initiated ART during pregnancy and 11% (N\u200a=\u200a3582) had no ART. Adjusted for maternal age, multiparity, hypertensive disorders and residential district, stillbirths were higher only for PPHIV not on ART [aPR 1.31 (95%CI 1.04-1.66)] compared to those without HIV. However, LBW and VLBW were higher among all PPHIV, with aPRs of 1.11-1.22 for LBW and 1.14-1.54 for VLBW. Pregnancy-initiated ART was associated with early pregnancy-related death (aPR 3.21; 95%CI 1.55-6.65), and HIV with or without ART was associated with late pregnancy-related death (aPRs 7.89-9.01).\nCONCLUSIONS: Even in the universal ART era, PPHIV experienced higher rates of LBW and VLBW newborns, and higher late pregnancy-related death regardless of ART status than pregnant people without HIV.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36629794": "OBJECTIVES: Early diagnosis of HIV is essential for successful treatment and controlling HIV spread in a population. We examined the frequency and characteristics of adults diagnosed late with HIV in New Zealand from 2011-2020.\nMETHODS: Routine surveillance data were analysed. Those previously diagnosed overseas or as part of immigration screening, or with missing CD4 count were excluded. 'Late presentation' was defined as a CD4 count <350 cells/\u03bcL or an AIDS-defining event. 'Advanced HIV disease' were those with a CD4 count <200 cells/\u03bcL or an AIDS-defining event. Relative risks were calculated using Poisson regression.\nRESULTS: Of 1145 people, 40.5% presented late; 24.9% had advanced HIV disease. Of the 464 late diagnoses, 65.5% occurred among men-who-have-sex-with-men (MSM), 26.1% among heterosexuals, 8.4% among others. Heterosexual men and women were more likely to present late (55.3%) compared to MSM (35.6%). Amongst MSM, those who were older, of an ethnicity other than European, acquired HIV overseas, tested because symptomatic, or had their last negative test >2\u00a0years prior were more likely to present late and have advanced disease. Amongst heterosexuals, older age, tested because symptomatic, and Pacific ethnicity were associated with late presentation, and M\u0101ori, Pacific and Asian people were more likely to have advanced disease.\nCONCLUSIONS: There continues to be a high proportion of people diagnosed late with HIV. Identifying barriers for testing, missed opportunities for screenings and other factors that delay HIV diagnosis could help develop effective strategies to reduce this burden of late presentation - particularly among heterosexual individuals, non-Europeans, and older people.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36630307": "Penile cancer is a rare malignancy which HIV infection appears to increase the risk of. The magnitude of this risk and the pathogenesis remain unclear. A comprehensive review of the literature was undertaken using conventional search strategies. Twenty-four publications were identified by this methodology, of which nine were case reports and 15 were observational studies. These studies were highly heterogeneous, with varying study designs, populations, and objectives. The risk of penile cancer within HIV-positive individuals is significantly greater than in those without HIV (RR = 3 .7 to 5.8, 3 studies; SIR = 3.8 to 11.1, 4 studies). HIV is also shown to influence disease characteristics, with a four-fold increased risk of death from penile cancer. Moreover, progression from intraepithelial neoplasia occurs earlier in HIV, six years sooner than in HIV-negative men. HIV-positive men have a higher prevalence of HPV infection. Ethnicity is also shown to modulate the relationship between HIV and penile carcinoma, with a higher risk of cancer in Hispanic, compared with Caucasian, HIV-positive men.

The prevalence of HAI was 29.9% (95% CI, 29.3, 30.4); The CCU during HAI in the last one month was 58.9%. Younger age at the start of sex work, use of mobile phone/internet for soliciting client, home as a place of sex work, consumption of alcohol/drug, and physical violence against FSWs were associated with higher odds of HAI. Frequent contact with outreach workers, awareness of sexually transmitted infection, and older age at the start of sex work was associated with CCU.\nCONCLUSION: Prevalence of HAI was high among FSW in India.

Most MS medications are available in the region, but not all, possibly affecting neurologists' prescribing habits.\nOBJECTIVES: To provide an overview of the current practices of Near East (NE) healthcare practitioners by probing their prescribing decisions, to report the COVID-19 impacts on neurologists' prescribing habits, and to explore the future relevance of current medication used in MS management among other newcomers.\nMETHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out using an online survey from April 27, 2022, to July 5, 2022. The questionnaire was designed with the input of five neurologists representing five NE countries (Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Jordan & Palestine). They identified several factors that play a crucial role in the optimal care of MS patients. The link was shared among neurologists using snowball sampling.\nRESULTS: The survey included 98 neurologists. Effectiveness and safety balance was the most important factor considered when selecting the MS treatment. Among patients with MS, the most challenging factor for the patients was thought to be related to family planning, followed by affordability and tolerability of side effects. In the treatment of mild to moderate relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) in men, Interferon beta 1a SC, Fingolimod, and Glatiramer acetate were the most commonly recommended treatments. Dimethyl fumarate substituted fingolimod in female patients. Interferon beta 1a SC was the safest treatment for mild to moderate RRMS. Interferon beta 1a SC was preferred over other treatments for patients with mild to moderate MS and planning for pregnancy (56.6%) or breastfeeding (60.2%).

Most (61.4%) had RRMS. Generally, platform injectables (IFN beta, glatiramer acetate) were the most used DMTs until 2010. It seems that introduction of newer agents (antiCD20s and oral DMTs) resulted in a decrease in the use of former drugs since around 2015. Some unusual practices are prominent such as using not approved DMTs for PPMS over the years, or administering high efficacy drugs like natalizumab for CIS. The results indicate the remaining popularity of first line injectable DMTs in female and pediatric patients.\nDISCUSSION: Mean age (SD) at onset in our study (29\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.8) is near the statistics in Asia and Oceania (28\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.7). Concerns about COVID-19 had a noticeable impact on administering high efficacy drugs like rituximab and fingolimod. However, in male patients this approach has not been the case. It may be related to more aggressive disease course in this group. The other possible explanation could be planning for pregnancy in female cases. The popularity of platform injectable drugs in pediatric MS may be related to its favorable safety profile over the years.

In 2010, prevalence of injectable DMTs was 43.1% compared to 2.5% for oral DMTs; by 2014, however, oral DMTs (26.5%) surpassed injectable DMTs (23.7%) as the most common route of administration. In the most recent data available (December, 2019), the most common DMTs were dimethyl fumarate, glatiramer acetate, and fingolimod.\nCONCLUSIONS: DMT use among reproductive-aged women has rapidly evolved during the past decade.

This randomized, controlled study explored the effect of early intervention with capnography on the incidence of hypoxia in mildly obese patients undergoing sedation for esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and colonoscopy.\nMETHODS: This is a single-center, randomized, single-blind, parallel-assignment, controlled trial. Mildly obese patients (28\u00a0kg/m2\u2009\u2264\u2009BMI\u2009&lt;\u200940\u00a0kg/m2) undergoing sedation for EGD and colonoscopy were randomly assigned to either the standard or capnography group. Standard cardiopulmonary monitoring equipment was used in both groups, and additional capnography was performed in the capnography group. In the event of inadequate alveolar ventilation during sedation, five interventions were administered in sequence (a-e) : a: increasing oxygen flow (5\u00a0L/min); b: a chin lift or jaw thrust maneuver; c: placement of the nasopharyngeal airway and chin lift; d: mask positive-pressure ventilation, and e: ventilator-assisted ventilation with tube insertion. The primary outcome was the incidence of hypoxia (SpO<sub>2</sub>\u2009&lt;\u200990%, \u2265\u200910\u00a0s) in each group. The secondary outcomes included the incidence of severe hypoxia (SpO<sub>2</sub>\u2009\u2264\u200985%), subclinical respiratory depression (90% \u2264 SpO<sub>2</sub>\u2009&lt;\u200995%), interventions, minimum SpO<sub>2</sub> during operation, patient satisfaction, endoscopist satisfaction, and other adverse events of anesthesia sedation.\nRESULTS: 228 patients were included (capnography group\u2009=\u2009112; standard group\u2009=\u2009113; three patients were excluded) in this study. The incidence of hypoxia was significantly lower in the capnography group than in the standard group (13.4% vs. 30.1%, P\u2009=\u20090.002). Subclinical respiratory depression in the capnography group was higher than that of the standard group (30.4% vs. 17.7%, P\u2009=\u20090.026). There was only a 5.4% incidence of severe hypoxia in the capnography group compared with 14.2% in the standard group (P\u2009=\u20090.026).

Capnography measures exhaled carbon dioxide and provides early identification of airway obstruction and hypoventilation. Capnography is useful in patients receiving supplemental oxygen. In these patients, oxygen desaturation reported by pulse oximetry may lag during episodes of respiratory depression and apnea.

It is hypothesized that the ocular pigmentary disturbance in Waardenburg's syndrome is widespread and involves the hyperchromic as well as the hypochromic areas of the eyes.

It is a benign tumor characterized by symmetrical diffuse adipose tissue deposition in the proximal extremities and neck. Until now, the etiology and pathogenesis of the disease have not been fully explained, resulting in difficulties in diagnosis and treatment; moreover, palliative treatment, such as surgical resection of adipose tissue or liposuction, is still the mainstream treatment for MD. However, the effectiveness of palliative surgery is limited, and most patients still relapse or metastasize after treatment. Therefore, we analyzed the relationship between tumor cells and immune cells in MD using single-cell RNA sequencing for the first time and combined an analysis of our results with a review of previous literature reports.

Lipectomy is typically necessary but such treatment can encounter difficulties due to the large sizes of the tumors, interspersed with important organs in the surrounding region. In this report, the authors evaluate the effectiveness of using tumescent solution in lipectomy to provide a dual treatment of tissue removal for Madelung disease in the head-and-neck region.\nMETHODS: A prospective study and clinical descriptions were conducted on 17 patients undergoing 26 head-and-neck lipectomies. A tumescent solution was injected into the surgical region with a blunt-tip cannula 5-10\u00a0min before skin incision. The authors recorded systemic manifestations both during and after surgery; tumescent volume; surgical region; clarity of the operative field; weight of fat removed, and early complications. After surgery, the authors followed the patients from periods of 3 months to 4 years.\nRESULTS: All 17 male patients had a history of alcoholism. In total, 12 lipectomies for the removal of anterior neck fatty masses and 14 lipectomies for the removal of posterior neck fatty masses were performed. The average amount of tumescent injected was 260.1\u00a0ml (range 140-550\u00a0ml). Surgery was reported as totally bloodless in 10 (38.5%) operative fields, with minimum bleeding in 12 (46.1%) operative fields, acceptable bleeding in four (15.4%) operative fields. The average surgical time was 175.6\u00a0min (range 135-250\u00a0min). The removed fatty masses weighed between 250 and 2150\u00a0g, with an average of 582.9\u00a0g. Early complications were seen in four patients, accounting for 15.4% (2 hematoma, 1 skin necrosis, and 1 seroma).\nCONCLUSIONS: Using tumescent solution in lipectomies to treat Madelung disease in the head and neck area is a simple, safe, and useful technique.

There are currently no systematic reviews summarizing the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of this disease. The purpose of the current article is to extract and analyze the existing evidence concerning Madelung disease derived from case series in order to provide adequate treatments for patients based on a more comprehensive understanding of the disease.\nMETHODS: PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases were queried for relevant articles using the search terms \"Madelung disease,\" \"multiple symmetric lipomatosis,\" \"Launois-Bensaude syndrome\" and synonyms until Aug 31,2020. Data statistics of Madelung disease epidemiology and clinical characteristics are summarized in different tables or charts with Microsoft Office software.\nRESULTS: Patients exhibiting Madelung disease were mostly located in Europe, although some records existed in Asia as well. Average patient age was between 45 and 65 years old. Type I was the most common form of the disease, and the neck was the most common location for tumors. Madelung disease is associated with various metabolic disorders, and hematoma and seroma were the most common complications. Overall recurrence rate was 18.3%, with similar recurrence rates after lipectomy and liposuction. Fewer complications occurred after liposuction compared with lipectomy, but relapse was more common after liposuction.\nCONCLUSION: Madelung disease consists of specific epidemiological and clinical characteristics, knowledge of which can be helpful for diagnosis and cognition. Lipectomy and liposuction are considered to be the most effective treatment methods for Madelung disease; however, choice of surgery should be based on comprehensive consideration of the disease, such as severity, mass location, and patient expectations.\nLEVEL OF EVIDENCE IV: This journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each article.

A new POP consisting of 4 mg drospirenone (DRSP) for 24 days plus 4-day hormone-free interval has been developed to address this need. DRSP is a potent progestin analogue of spironolactone, with antiandrogenic and antimineralocorticoid properties.\nAREAS COVERED: This is a narrative review of the available data on the pharmacotherapy of the new DRSP-only pill. The research includes aspects of pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of the compound: the main focus is on the clinical effects of DRSP-only pill in terms of contraceptive efficacy, haemostatic effect, safety, tolerability and bleeding patterns.\nEXPERT OPINION: The DRSP-only pill presents a similar Pearl Index to that of common combined hormonal contraceptives: it is a POP with a better bleeding profile than traditional POPs (higher rates of scheduled bleedings and much lower rates of unscheduled intracyclic bleeding/spotting) which could increase its acceptability and the panorama of possible users. For these reasons, DRSP-only pill represents a real step forward in oral contraception with only progestins, even if the bleeding patterns during its use are still different to oestrogen-containing products (i.e. lower rates of scheduled bleedings and higher rate of amenorrhea).", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31321765": "INTRODUCTION: Approximately 100 million women currently use combined oral contraceptives. Combined oral contraceptives use is associated with increased risk of venous thromboembolic events and cardiovascular disease. Progestin-only pills do not increase the risk of venous thromboembolic events, stroke and myocardial infarction but are associated with a poor cycle control. A novel estrogen-free pill containing only drospirenone (DRSP) was developed to improve bleeding pattern, tolerability and acceptance without increasing venous thromboembolic events risks in contraception.\nMATERIAL AND METHODS: Two prospective, multicenter Phase III studies in healthy women aged 18-45\u00a0years were performed to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of a drospirenone-only pill in a regimen of 24\u00a0days of 4\u00a0mg of drospirenone tablets followed by 4\u00a0days of placebo. A total of 1571 women (14\u00a0329 exposure cycles) were analyzed: 713 patients in the 13-cycle study 1 with 7638 exposure cycles and 858 patients in the 9-cycle study 2 with 6691 exposure cycles. The primary endpoint was the overall Pearl index, calculated for each study separately, and for both pooled. As main secondary efficacy endpoint, the \"method failure Pearl index\" including all pregnancies during \"perfect medication cycles\" was evaluated. EudraCT registration numbers: 2010-021787-15 & 2011-002396-42.\nRESULTS: Calculations on pooled studies 1 and 2 with 1571 patients gave an overall Pearl index (based on 14\u00a0329 cycles) of 0.7258 (95% CI 0.3133 to 1.4301). No single case of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism and only one case of hyperkalemia were reported. Additional information such as laboratory parameters, body mass index, bodyweight, heart rate and blood pressure showed no statistically significant changes due to the treatment.\nCONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of a new drospirenone-only oral contraceptive providing clinical efficacy similar to combined oral contraceptives, with a good safety profile, and favorable cycle control.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21080791": "Although combined oral contraceptives (COCs) are commonly used and highly effective in preventing pregnancy, they may not be suitable for some women. COC use is associated with increased rates of cardiovascular events and is not recommended in nonbreastfeeding women in the immediate postpartum period or in breastfeeding women during the initial 6 months of breastfeeding. Moreover, estrogen-related adverse effects, such as headache, are common. Estrogen-free progestin-only pills (POPs) are a valuable option in women who prefer to take an oral hormonal contraceptive, but are ineligible for, or choose not to use, COCs. Although some POPs have been associated with lower contraceptive effectiveness than COCs, the POP containing desogestrel has shown similar contraceptive effectiveness to COCs. The most commonly reported complaints in women using all POPs are bleeding problems. Counseling women interested in using POPs about the variable bleeding patterns associated with this method may improve compliance and acceptance.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36720088": "Breakthrough bleeding is a side effect of progesterone-only pills (POPs) in 40% of women, and is reduced to 10% with combined hormonal contraceptives (CHCs). In addition, breakthrough bleeding is reduced if POP is supplemented with norethisterone. As breakthrough bleeding is responsible for a quarter of women stopping the pill, it is vital to realize that CHC is an alternative to POP-even during lactation. CHCs are considered safe during lactation, do not reduce milk production, nor impede infant development. Nevertheless, CHCs are often not prescribed for lactating mothers due to this misconception that they reduce milk production. Among Orthodox Jews, breakthrough bleeding frequently results in stopping POP, as Jewish religious law prohibits any physical contact of the mother with her partner during active bleeding, and for 7 days after bleeding. When such bleeding occurs, not choosing a CHC alternative, results in couples risking discontinuation of POP, and in conceiving within a year of the previous birth, with its increased risk of preterm labor and birth defects. To measure how physicians respond to the presumed dilemma of balancing the risk of breakthrough bleeding versus the concern of reduction of milk production, we conducted a preliminary online survey. Physicians were asked if they would prescribe CHC instead of POP to breastfeeding mothers, 3 months postpartum with breakthrough bleeding. Half of the physicians responded they would prescribe CHC, whereas close to half of the physicians responded that they would not. The main reasons given by the respondents for avoiding CHC was a concern regarding possible milk reduction. These results confirm a significant degree of a lack of updated pharmacological information regarding the options of oral contraceptive use for lactating mothers, particularly for those where breakthrough bleeding has major behavioral and religious consequences. Thus, we contend that the risk of breakthrough bleeding justifies the more routine use of CHC in lieu of POP in lactating mothers.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38002722": "Until breastfeeding is established, progesterone-only pill (POP) use is preferable over combined hormonal contraception (CHC), as the latter potentially reduces milk production. Yet, POPs are often associated with breakthrough bleeding (BTB), and irregular spotting is often a reason for their cessation. Conversely, CHC is less associated with BTB but is not usually prescribed, even if breastfeeding has been established, despite its verified safety profile. Here, we surveyed physicians' perception of CHC safety during breastfeeding through an online questionnaire (N = 112). Physicians were asked if they would prescribe CHC to a woman three months postpartum, breastfeeding fully, and suffering from BTB while using POPs. Half of the physicians responded they would, 28% would not until six months postpartum, while 14% would not during breastfeeding. Of the physicians that would prescribe CHC, 58% would without any reservation, 24% would only after discussing milk reduction with the patient, 9% would use a pill with a lower hormonal dose, and 9% would only prescribe CHC 3 months postpartum. The main risk associated with CHC during breastfeeding, as perceived by physicians, is a potential decrease in breast milk production (88%). While some physicians consider CHC unsafe during breastfeeding, most health organizations consider CHC compatible with breastfeeding 5-6 weeks after birth. Thus, there is a gap in the attitude and knowledge of physicians about the safety profile of CHC, and only half acknowledge that the risk of BTB justifies the use of CHC instead of POPs while breastfeeding three months postpartum. We highlight the importance of physician's education, advocate CHC breastfeeding compatibility if breastfeeding has been established (i.e., 30 days postpartum), and underline the importance of discussing the option of CHC with patients in case POPs have unwanted side effects.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37195941": "BACKGROUND: Peresolimab is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody designed to stimulate the endogenous programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitory pathway.

The primary outcome was the change from baseline to week 12 in the Disease Activity Score for 28 joints based on the C-reactive protein level (DAS28-CRP). The DAS28-CRP ranges from 0 to 9.4, with higher scores indicating more severe disease. The primary comparison was between the 700-mg group and the placebo group. Secondary outcomes included the percentages of patients with American College of Rheumatology 20 (ACR20), ACR50, and ACR70 responses - defined as improvements from baseline of 20%, 50%, and 70% or more, respectively, in the numbers of tender and swollen joints and in at least three of five important domains - at week 12.\nRESULTS: At week 12, the change from baseline in the DAS28-CRP was significantly greater in the 700-mg peresolimab group than in the placebo group (least-squares mean change [\u00b1SE], -2.09\u00b10.18 vs. -0.99\u00b10.26; difference in change, -1.09 [95% confidence interval, -1.73 to -0.46]; P<0.001). The results of the analyses of secondary outcomes favored the 700-mg dose over placebo with respect to the ACR20 response but not with respect to the ACR50 and ACR70 responses. Adverse events were similar in the peresolimab and placebo groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: Peresolimab showed efficacy in a phase 2a trial in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

Data on the efficacy of novel corticosteroid formulations, developed specifically for esophageal delivery, have recently become available.\nMETHODS: A comprehensive review was performed aiming to summarize evidence on the role of STCs in the treatment of EoE. Two biomedical bibliographic databases (PubMED, EMBASE) were searched for articles providing original information on the efficacy and safety of STCs in adult EoE patients.\nRESULTS: Budesonide orodispersible tablet (BOT) and budesonide oral suspension (BOS) both surpassed placebo formulations regarding the efficacy of inducing and maintaining histologic, symptomatic and endoscopic remission. Overall, BOT displayed the highest grade of efficacy with clinico-histologic remission rates up to 75% after 1 year.

Our understanding of EoE pathophysiology has evolved since its initial recognition more than 20 years ago and has translated into diagnostic and novel therapeutic approaches that are affecting patient care. The mechanisms underlying disease development and progression are influenced by diverse factors, such as genetics, age, allergic comorbidities, and allergen exposures. Central to EoE pathophysiology is a dysregulated feed-forward cycle that develops between the esophageal epithelium and the immune system. Allergen-induced, type 2-biased immune activation by the esophageal epithelium propagates a cycle of impaired mucosal barrier integrity and allergic inflammation, eventually leading to tissue remodeling and progressive organ dysfunction. Herein, we review the current understanding of fundamental pathophysiological mechanisms contributing to EoE pathogenesis.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37064719": "INTRODUCTION: Under homeostatic conditions, esophageal epithelium displays a proliferation/differentiation gradient that is generated as proliferative basal cells give rise to suprabasal cells then terminally differentiated superficial cells. This proliferation/differentiation gradient is often perturbed in esophageal pathologies. Basal cell hyperplasia may occur in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), a condition in which acid from the stomach enters the esophagus, or eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), an emerging form of food allergy. While GERD is a primary risk factor for esophageal cancer, epidemiological data suggests that EoE patients do not develop esophageal cancer.\nMETHODS: In order to investigate the impact of EoE and esophageal cancer specifically on the cellular landscape of esophageal epithelium, we perform single cell RNA-sequencing in murine models of EoE and esophageal cancer, specifically esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). We further evaluate modules of co-expressed genes in EoE- and ESCC-enriched epithelial cell clusters. Finally, we pair EoE and ESCC murine models to examine the functional relationship between these pathologies.\nRESULTS: In mice with either EoE or ESCC, we find expansion of cell populations as compared to normal esophageal epithelium. In mice with EoE, we detect distinct expansion of 4 suprabasal populations coupled with depletion of 2 basal populations. By contrast, mice with ESCC display unique expansion of 2 basal populations and 1 suprabasal population, as well as depletion of 2 suprabasal populations. Senescence, glucocorticoid receptor signaling, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor pathways are associated with EoE-enriched clusters while pathways associated with cell proliferation and metabolism are identified in ESCC-enriched clusters. Finally, our in vivo data demonstrate that exposure to EoE inflammation limits tumor burden of esophageal carcinogenesis.\nDISCUSSION: Our findings provide the first functional investigation of the relationship between EoE and esophageal cancer and suggest that esophageal epithelial remodeling events occurring in response to EoE inflammation may limit esophageal carcinogenesis.

RE is characterized by epithelial infiltration with small numbers of neutrophils and eosinophils, EoE by a prominent eosinophilic infiltrate. Lymphocytic esophagitis (LE), a new entity characterized by peripapillary lymphocytosis, questions the role lymphocytes play in esophageal inflammation. We test the hypothesis that lymphocyte infiltration in RE differs from EoE. One blinded pathologist read esophageal biopsies from 39 RE and 39 EoE patients. Both groups demonstrated significant numbers of lymphocytes (RE 22.7 +/- 2.2/HPF, EoE 19.8 +/- 1.8/HPF). Eosinophils/HPF in RE and EoE were 2.8 +/- 0.7 and 74.9 +/- 8.2, respectively (P < 0.001). Neutrophils were uncommon in RE (0.26 +/- 0.16/HPF) and EoE (0.09 +/- 0.04; P = 0.07). Eight of the 39 RE specimens had >or=50 lymphocytes in >or=1 HPF. Two were consistent with LE. There was an inverse correlation between numbers of eosinophils and lymphocytes in EoE (R = -0.47; P = 0.002), and no correlation between them in RE (R = 0.18; P = 0.36). The patients with EoE who used antireflux medications had fewer lymphocytes (16.3 +/- 1.3 vs 22.2 +/- 2.3/HPF; P = 0.030) and eosinophils (55.6 +/- 5.2 vs 76.0 +/- 8.7/HPF; P = 0.042) than those who did not. The pathological role of lymphocytes in RE and EoE may be underestimated. Our observation that 5% of the RE specimens meet histopathological criteria for LE potentially blurs the line between these entities.

Patients with GERD were age-matched one to one with patients with EoE. Clinical, endoscopic, and histologic information at the time of diagnosis was obtained from the medical record and compared between pairs by McNemar test.

Many aspects of EoE were statistically distinct from GERD when controlling for age. Male sex, dysphagia, history of food impaction, absence of pain/heartburn, linear furrowing, and white papules were the distinguishing variables used to create the logistic regression model and scoring system based on odds ratios.

Uterine fibroid symptoms include abnormal menstrual bleeding leading to anaemia, tiredness, chronic vaginal discharge, and pain during periods. Other symptoms include protrusion of the abdomen, pain during intercourse, dysfunctions of bladder/bowel leading to urinary incontinence/retention, pain, and constipation.

Several next-generation sequencing technologies have been performed to identify the underlying genetic and epigenetic basis of fibroids. However, there remains a systemic gap in our understanding of molecular and biological process that define uterine fibroids. Recent epitranscriptomics studies have unraveled RNA modifications that are associated with all forms of RNA and are thought to influence both normal physiological functions and the progression of diseases. We quantified RNA expression profiles by analyzing publicly available RNA-seq data for 15 known epigenetic mediators to identify their expression profile in uterine fibroids compared to myometrium. To validate our findings, we performed RT-qPCR on a separate cohort of uterine fibroids targeting these modifiers confirming our RNA-seq data. We then examined protein profiles of key m6A modifiers in fibroids and their matched myometrium. In concordance with our RNA expression profiles, no significant differences were observed in these proteins in uterine fibroids compared to myometrium. To determine abundance of RNA modifications, mRNA and small RNA from fibroids and matched myometrium were analyzed by UHPLC MS/MS. In addition to the prevalent N6-methyladenosine (m6A), we identified 11 other known modifiers but did not identify any aberrant expression in fibroids.

The active antiviral component nirmatrelvir in Paxlovid is co-formulated with ritonavir, a strong cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 inhibitor. Many oral targeted therapies indicated for lung cancer are known substrates of CYP 3A4, and concurrent use with Paxlovid may lead to potential drug-drug interaction (DDI). The purpose of this review is to evaluate the potential DDI between targeted therapies and supportive care for lung cancer and ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir.\nMETHODS: Drug database search in PubMed and the Food and Drug Administration was conducted to identify pharmacokinetic data on oral tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) used in NSCLC, both Food and Drug Administration approved and those in development. Metabolism pathways for various TKIs are extracted, and the impact of TKI area under the curves and maximum concentration by strong CYP 3A4 inducers and inhibitors is summarized. The most common toxicities and supportive care medications for the TKI were identified.\nRESULTS: Among EGFR and exon 20 insertion inhibitors, afatinib is least likely to be affected by CYP 3A4, followed by dacomitinib and osimertinib. Among ALK inhibitors, alectinib is the least susceptible to CYP 3A4. ROS1 inhibitors are affected by CYP 3A4 inhibition with the exception of crizotinib. Among MET inhibitors, capmatinib is substantially affected by CYP 3A4 inhibition. Drug exposure of RET inhibitors is expected to increase with CYP 3A4 inhibition, with selpercatinib being the least affected. Certain supportive care medications for lung cancer TKI may have relevant DDIs.\nCONCLUSIONS: The clinical impact of the DDI between lung cancer TKI and ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir varies largely on the basis of the susceptibility of CYP 3A4 inhibition caused by the antiviral. Close monitoring and medication adjustments (i.e., dose changes or alternative coronavirus disease 2019 therapy) can be used to overcome DDI to ensure patient safety.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36572992": "OBJECTIVE: Selpercatinib and pralsetinib are new targeted therapies used to treat patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) due to RET gene rearrangements. The objective of this article is to review selpercatinib and pralsetinib in the context of RET-fusion-positive NSCLC.\nDATA SOURCES: The pivotal LIBRETTO-001 and ARROW trials were evaluated regarding the use of selpercatinib and pralsetinib as treatment for RET-fusion-positive NSCLC. Comparative studies, review articles and current studies on selpercatinib and pralsetinib in RET-fusion-positive NSCLC were searched on pubmed.org and scholar.google.com using \"selpercatinib,\" \"pralsetinib,\" and \"NSCLC\" as keywords. Product monographs were searched on google.ca and uptodate.com using the keywords \"selpercatinib,\" \"pralsetinib,\" and/or \"monograph.\"\nDATA SUMMARY: Selpercatinib and pralsetinib are orally administered highly selective RET inhibitors approved by the FDA following the accelerated approvals granted due to the pivotal LIBRETTO-001 and ARROW trials which evaluated selpercatinib and pralsetinib, respectively. Both drugs have shown efficacy for brain metastases and are primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 through hepatic metabolism. The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse effects of selpercatinib were hypertension, increased ALT level, and increased AST level while for pralsetinib, it was neutropenia, hypertension, and anemia. The safety profile shows similarities in severity and tolerability but additional monitoring for QT prolongation in patients on selpercatinib is recommended, compared to the risks of interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis for patients on pralsetinib.\nCONCLUSIONS: Overall, the increased use of selpercatinib and pralsetinib has led to the implementation of these drugs in the clinical practice of healthcare professionals such as pharmacists.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36626081": "PURPOSE: MTC has varying clinical course. In cases with metastatic disease (meta-MTC) further therapeutic modalities (locoregional and/or Tyrosine-Kinase-Inhibitors, TKIs) are needed. Clinical features, disease progression, response to therapy and possible factors predisposing to TKIs response-resistance in meta-MTCs were investigated.\nMETHODS: Out of 338 MTC patients 54 had meta-MTC and were followed for 0.7-46 years (median 10.5); therapeutic interventions and response to therapy were recorded retrospectively.\nRESULTS: Of 54 meta-MTC patients, 34/54 were men, 44/54 sporadic (age-at-diagnosis 47\u2009\u00b1\u200917.4 years, range: 5-78). Distant metastases at diagnosis were present in 12/54 (\u22652 loci in 8/12), 7/12 received TKIs; During follow-up metastases occurred in 42/54 (within 0.6-25 years from diagnosis, median 5\u2009yrs). Locoregional therapies were administered to 44/54 (81.5%) and TKIs to 40/54 (74.1%). Vandetanib was administered in 30 patients (24 as first-line therapy). The median progression-free-survival, PFS) was 48 months (range 4-120), partial response (PR): 26.7%, stable disease (SD): 23.3%, progressive disease (PD): 50.0%, cancer-specific survival: 44.8%, (16 in ongoing-therapy). More favorable disease course was recorded in familial-MTC compared to sporadic (p\u2009=\u20090.02) and in those patients with serious-adverse-events (SAEs) under treatment (p\u2009=\u20090.027). Those with biochemical progression under vandetanib, later showed more frequently structural progression (p\u2009=\u20090.007). Ten patients received cabozantinib (8/10 as second-line therapy, median PFS:11 months (3-36 months), 8/10 died). Three RET-mutant patients received selpercatinib; all showed PR. Within the total follow-up period, the response to therapy was: PR: 8/54 (14.8%), SD: 15/54 (27.8%), PD: 31/54 (57.4%), cancer-specific survival 46.3%. Mortality was higher in older patients (\u226560 years) compared to younger ones (<60\u2009yrs) (83.3 vs 45.2%, p\u2009=\u20090.021). Outcome was better in familial-MTC vs sporadic (PR: 50 vs 6.8%, SD: 20 vs 29.5%, PD: 30 vs 59.1%, p\u2009=\u20090.007).\nCONCLUSIONS: Meta-MTCs treatment results in disease stabilization in 42.6% during a median 10.5 year follow-up. Combination of locoregional and systemic therapies may result in more favorable PFS. Family history, younger age, SAEs may predict better response; biochemical escape under TKI needs to be followed-up closely as it may indicate disease progression.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36632846": "Precision oncology informed by genomic information has evolved in leaps and bounds over the last decade. Although non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has moved to center-stage as the poster child of precision oncology, multiple targetable genomic alterations have been identified in various cancer types. RET alterations occur in roughly 2% of all human cancers. The role of RET as oncogenic driver was initially identified in 1985 after the discovery that transfection with human lymphoma DNA transforms NIH-3T3 fibroblasts. Germline RET mutations are causative of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 syndrome, and RET fusions are found in 10-20% of papillary thyroid cases and are detected in most patients with advanced sporadic medullary thyroid cancer. RET fusions are oncogenic drivers in 2% of Non-small cell lung cancer. Rapid translation and regulatory approval of selective RET inhibitors, selpercatinib and pralsetinib, have opened up the field of RET precision oncology. This review provides an update on RET precision oncology from bench to bedside and back.

The novel role of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-35 in sepsis was examined. Methods: Sepsis was induced by in C57BL/6 mice cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). The impacts of IL-35 on effector CD4 + T cells were investigated by examining cell proliferation and the Th1/Th2 ratio in the presence of recombinant IL-35 (rIL-35) or anti-IL-35 (EBI3). The regulatory effect of IL-35 on autophagy was evaluated by measuring autophagy markers and autophagic flux in CLP mice in vivo and in activated effector CD4 + T cells in vitro . Results: IL-35 levels were significantly increased in the serum and spleens of septic mice. rIL-35 administration after CLP further decreased proliferation and the Th1/Th2 ratio in effector CD4 + T cells and significantly shortened the survival time. Sepsis-induced autophagy activation was protective in effector CD4 + T cells and was blocked by rIL-35. The inhibitory effect of IL-35 on autophagy was observed in activated effector CD4 + T cells in vitro , and this effect was mediated by restricting high mobility group box-1 protein (HMGB1) translocation. Conclusion: IL-35 is an immunosuppressive cytokine that impairs CD4 + T-cell proliferation and differentiation in sepsis, and the effect might be mediated by reducing HMGB1-dependent autophagy.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36579639": "PROBLEM: Interleukin 35 (IL-35) is involved in the pathogenesis of endometriosis by suppressing immunoreaction and promoting endometrial cell proliferation. It may also be an essential cytokine in forming the immunosuppressive functions of regulatory B lymphocytes (Bregs). The involvement of Bregs in the pathogenesis of endometriosis has not been previously investigated. In this study, we determined the frequencies of different Breg subpopulations, namely, B10, immature B-cells, and plasmablasts, and their abilities to produce IL-35 in women with endometriosis compared to healthy women.\nMETHODS: The frequencies of different subpopulations of Bregs producing IL-35 were measured in the peripheral blood of women with endometriosis (total pool), women with deep infiltration endometriosis (DIE), women with ovarian endometriosis, and healthy women as a control by flow cytometry.\nRESULTS: We observed a decrease in the percentage of B10 cells and plasmablasts in women with endometriosis and an increase in the percentage of these Breg populations producing IL-35 in the same experimental group. Interestingly, we also revealed that women with DIE had increased percentages of B10 cells and plasmablasts producing IL-35.\nCONCLUSION: Taken together, our findings are the first to reveal the frequencies of different subpopulations of Bregs producing IL-35 in women with endometriosis. The results suggest that IL-35 expression in B lymphocytes could be used as a peripheral marker of endometriosis; however, further studies are needed.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37464473": "BACKGROUND: Interleukin-35 (IL-35), secreted by regulatory T cells (Treg) and B cells, is immunosuppressive under both physiological and pathological conditions. However, the role of IL-35 in all responses has yet to be investigated. Here, we demonstrate that IL-35 protects allografts by stabilizing the Treg phenotype and suppressing CD8 + T-cell activation in a mouse heart transplantation model.\nMETHODS: The effect of IL-35 on immune cell infiltration in grafts and secondary lymphoid organs was examined using mass cytometry, flow cytometry, and immunofluorescence. Moreover, using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, flow cytometry, and phospho-flow assays, we demonstrated that IL-35 maintains Treg phenotypes to restrain CD8 + T cells via the gp130/signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 pathway.\nRESULTS: Mass cytometry analysis of intragraft immune cells showed that IL-35 decreased CD8 + T-cell infiltration and increased Foxp3 and IL-35 expressions in Treg. In vitro, we demonstrated that IL-35 directly promoted Treg phenotypic and functional stability and its IL-35 secretion, generating a positive feedback loop. However, Treg are required for IL-35 to exert its suppressive effect on CD8 + T cells in vitro. After depleting Treg in the recipient, IL-35 did not prolong graft survival or decrease CD8 + T-cell infiltration. Mechanistically, we found that IL-35 sustained Treg stability via the gp130/signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 signaling pathway.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight that IL-35 stabilizes the Treg phenotype to ameliorate CD8 + T-cell infiltration in the allograft, which has never been described in the transplanted immunological milieu.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36314719": "Interleukin 35 (IL-35) mediates immunosuppression of T cells in autoimmune diseases. T cells play an important role in primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) with incompletely elucidated pathogenesis. Thus, we aimed to investigate the role of IL-35 regulation on T cells in PBC patients. Fifty-one PBC patients and 28 controls were enrolled in this study. Plasma IL-35 level was measured. Purified peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were stimulated with exogenous IL-35 to investigate their functional phenotypes. IL-35-treated CD8+ T cells were cultured with human intrahepatic biliary epithelial cell line to determine the cytotoxicity of CD8+ T cells from PBC patients. Plasma IL-35 concentration was lower in PBC patients and negatively correlated with alkaline phosphatase. CD4+ T cells from PBC patients exhibited elevated transcription factor expressions and cytokine secretion, whereas CD8+ T cells produced increased cytotoxic molecules and cytokines. In vitro IL-35 stimulation suppressed the production of IL-17 and IL-22 by CD4+ T cells from PBC patients. CD8+ T cells treated with IL-35 mediated reduced target cell death in the direct contact co-culture system in PBC patients. This process was accompanied by reduced production of cytotoxic molecules and cytokines and increased expressions of immune checkpoint receptors in CD8+ T cells. Reduced circulating IL-35 might be insufficient to suppress T cell function, leading to the immune dysregulation in PBC patients.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29371247": "OBJECTIVE: IL-35 (interleukin-35) is an anti-inflammatory cytokine, which inhibits immune responses by inducing regulatory T cells and regulatory B cells and suppressing effector T cells and macrophages. It remains unknown whether atherogenic stimuli induce IL-35 and whether IL-35 inhibits atherogenic lipid-induced endothelial cell (EC) activation and atherosclerosis. EC activation induced by hyperlipidemia stimuli, including lysophosphatidylcholine is considered as an initiation step for monocyte recruitment and atherosclerosis. In this study, we examined the expression of IL-35 during early atherosclerosis and the roles and mechanisms of IL-35 in suppressing lysophosphatidylcholine-induced EC activation.\nAPPROACH AND RESULTS: Using microarray and ELISA, we found that IL-35 and its receptor are significantly induced during early atherosclerosis in the aortas and plasma of ApoE (apolipoprotein E) knockout mice-an atherosclerotic mouse model-and in the plasma of hypercholesterolemic patients. In addition, we found that IL-35 suppresses lysophosphatidylcholine-induced monocyte adhesion to human aortic ECs. Furthermore, our RNA-sequencing analysis shows that IL-35 selectively inhibits lysophosphatidylcholine-induced EC activation-related genes, such as ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion molecule-1). Mechanistically, using flow cytometry, mass spectrometry, electron spin resonance analyses, and chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing analyses, we found that IL-35 blocks lysophosphatidylcholine-induced mitochondrial reactive oxygen species, which are required for the induction of site-specific H3K14 (histone 3 lysine 14) acetylation, increased binding of proinflammatory transcription factor AP-1 in the promoter of ICAM-1, and induction of ICAM-1 transcription in human aortic EC. Finally, IL-35 cytokine therapy suppresses atherosclerotic lesion development in ApoE knockout mice.\nCONCLUSIONS: IL-35 is induced during atherosclerosis development and inhibits mitochondrial reactive oxygen species-H3K14 acetylation-AP-1-mediated EC activation.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33080902": "Ebolaviruses, discovered in 1976, belongs to the Filoviridae family, which also includes Marburg and Lloviu viruses. They are negative-stranded RNA viruses with six known species identified to date. Ebola virus (EBOV) is a member of Zaire ebolavirus species and can cause the Ebola virus disease (EVD), an emerging zoonotic disease that results in homeostatic imbalance and multi-organ failure. There are three EBOV outbreaks documented in the last six years resulting in significant morbidity (&gt; 32,000 cases) and mortality (&gt; 13,500 deaths). The potential factors contributing to the high infectivity of this virus include multiple entry mechanisms, susceptibility of the host cells, employment of multiple immune evasion mechanisms and rapid person-to-person transmission. EBOV infection leads to cytokine storm, disseminated intravascular coagulation, host T cell apoptosis as well as cell mediated and humoral immune response. In this review, a concise recap of cell types targeted by EBOV and EVD symptoms followed by detailed run-through of host innate and adaptive immune responses, virus-driven regulation and their combined effects contributing to the disease pathogenesis has been presented. At last, the vaccine and drug development initiatives as well as challenges related to the management of infection have been discussed.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30513823": "There is an increasing frequency of reports regarding the persistence of the Ebola virus (EBOV) in Ebola virus disease (EVD) survivors. During the 2014\u207b2016 West African EVD epidemic, sporadic transmission events resulted in the initiation of new chains of human-to-human transmission. Multiple reports strongly suggest that these re-emergences were linked to persistent EBOV infections and included sexual transmission from EVD survivors. Asymptomatic infection and long-term viral persistence in EVD survivors could result in incidental introductions of the Ebola virus in new geographic regions and raise important national and local public health concerns. Alarmingly, although the persistence of filoviruses and their potential for sexual transmission have been documented since the emergence of such viruses in 1967, there is limited knowledge regarding the events that result in filovirus transmission to, and persistence within, the male reproductive tract. Asymptomatic infection and long-term viral persistence in male EVD survivors could lead to incidental transfer of EBOV to new geographic regions, thereby generating widespread outbreaks that constitute a significant threat to national and global public health. Here, we review filovirus testicular persistence and discuss the current state of knowledge regarding the rates of persistence in male survivors, and mechanisms underlying reproductive tract localization and sexual transmission.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30381349": "Ebola virus (EBOV) has been responsible for sporadic outbreaks in Central Africa since 1976 and has the potential of causing social disruption and public panic as illustrated by the 2013-2016 epidemic in West Africa. Transmission of EBOV has been described to occur via contact with infected bodily fluids, supported by data indicating that infectious EBOV could be cultured from blood, semen, saliva, urine, and breast milk. Parameters influencing transmission of EBOV are, however, largely undefined in part due to the lack of an established animal model to study mechanisms of pathogen spread. Here, we investigated EBOV transmissibility in male and female ferrets. After intranasal challenge, an infected animal was placed in direct contact with a naive ferret and in contact with another naive ferret (separated from the infected animal by a metal mesh) that served as the indirect-contact animal. All challenged animals, male direct contacts, and one male indirect contact developed disease and died. The remaining animals were not viremic and remained asymptomatic but developed EBOV-glycoprotein IgM and/or IgG specific antibodies-indicative of virus transmission. EBOV transmission via indirect contact was frequently observed in this model but resulted in less-severe disease compared to direct contact. Interestingly, these observations are consistent with the detection of specific antibodies in humans living in areas of EBOV endemicity.IMPORTANCE Our knowledge regarding transmission of EBOV between individuals is vague and is mostly limited to spreading via direct contact with infectious bodily fluids. Studying transmission parameters such as dose and route of infection is nearly impossible in naturally acquired cases-hence the requirement for a laboratory animal model. Here, we show as a proof of concept that ferrets can be used to study EBOV transmission. We also show that transmission in the absence of direct contact is frequent, as all animals with indirect contact with the infected ferrets had detectable antibodies to the virus, and one succumbed to infection. Our report provides a new small-animal model for studying EBOV transmission that does not require adaptation of the virus, providing insight into virus transmission among humans during epidemics.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25719678": "As late as September 14, 2014, Liberia's Gbarpolu County had reported zero cases of Ebola virus disease (Ebola). On October 25, the Bong County Health Team, a local health department in the Liberian Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MOHSW), received confirmation of Ebola in a man who had recently left Geleyansiesu, a remote village of approximately 800 residents, after his wife and daughter had died of illnesses consistent with Ebola. MOHSW requested assistance from CDC, the World Health Organization, and other international partners to investigate and confirm the outbreak in Geleyansiesu and begin interventions to interrupt transmission. A total of 22 cases were identified, of which 18 (82%) were laboratory confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. There were 16 deaths (case-fatality rate = 73%). Without road access to or direct telecommunications with the village, interventions had to be tailored to the local context. Public health interventions included 1) education of the community about Ebola, transmission of the virus, signs and symptoms, the importance of isolating ill patients from family members, and the potential benefits of early diagnosis and treatment; 2) establishment of mechanisms to alert health authorities of possibly infected persons leaving the village to facilitate safe transport to the closest Ebola treatment unit (ETU); 3) case investigation, contact tracing, and monitoring of contacts; 4) training in hygienic burial of dead bodies; 5) active case finding and diagnosis; and 6) isolation and limited no-touch treatment in the village of patients unwilling or unable to seek care at an ETU.

Up to 90% of infected patients die, and there is no available treatment or vaccine. The sporadic human outbreaks are believed to result when EBOV \"jumps\" from an infected animal to a person and is subsequently transmitted between persons by direct contact with infected blood or body fluids. This study was undertaken to investigate the mechanism by which EBOV can persistently infect and then escape from model cell and animal reservoir systems. We report a model system in which infection of mouse and bat cell lines with EBOV leads to persistence, which can be broken with low levels of lipopolysaccharide or phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA). This reactivation depends on the Ras/MAPK pathway through inhibition of RNA-dependent protein kinase and eukaryotic initiation factor 2alpha phosphorylation and occurs at the level of protein synthesis. EBOV also can be evoked from mice 7 days after infection by PMA treatment, indicating that a similar mechanism occurs in vivo. Our findings suggest that EBOV may persist in nature through subclinical infection of a reservoir species, such as bats, and that appropriate physiological stimulation may result in increased replication and transmission to new hosts. Identification of a presumptive mechanism responsible for EBOV emergence from its reservoir underscores the \"hit-and-run\" nature of the initiation of human and/or nonhuman primate EBOV outbreaks and may provide insight into possible countermeasures to interfere with transmission.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36690705": "Patients with metastatic NSCLC bearing a ROS1 gene fusion usually experience prolonged disease control with ROS1-targeting tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), but significant clinical heterogeneity exists in part due to the presence of co-occurring genomic alterations.

At progression, the patient continued entrectinib and started sotorasib, a small molecule inhibitor of KRAS p.G12C. A patient-derived cell line generated at progression on entrectinib demonstrated improved TKI responsiveness when treated with entrectinib and sotorasib.

We compared the efficacy and safety of sotorasib with a standard-of-care treatment in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with the KRASG12C mutation who had been previously treated with other anticancer drugs.\nMETHODS: We conducted a randomised, open-label phase 3 trial at 148 centres in 22 countries. We recruited patients aged at least 18 years with KRASG12C-mutated advanced NSCLC, who progressed after previous platinum-based chemotherapy and a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor. Key exclusion criteria included new or progressing untreated brain lesions or symptomatic brain lesions, previously identified oncogenic driver mutation other than KRASG12C for which an approved therapy is available (eg EGFR or ALK), previous treatment with docetaxel (neoadjuvant or adjuvant docetaxel was allowed if the tumour did not progress within 6 months after the therapy was terminated), previous treatment with a direct KRASG12C inhibitor, systemic anticancer therapy within 28 days of study day 1, and therapeutic or palliative radiation therapy within 2 weeks of treatment initiation.

This discovery stemmed from our finding that Survivin expression is downregulated upon treatment of pancreatic cancer cells with the KRASG12C inhibitor Sotorasib. We went on to show that oncogenic KRAS increases Survivin expression by activating extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 in pancreatic cancer cells and that treating the cells either with siRNAs targeting Survivin or with YM155, a small molecule that potently blocks Survivin expression, downregulates MYC and strongly inhibited their growth. We further determined that Survivin protects MYC from degradation by blocking autophagy, which then prevents cellular inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A from undergoing autophagic degradation. Cellular inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A, by inhibiting protein phosphatase 2A, helps to maintain MYC phosphorylation at Ser 62, thereby ensuring its cooperation with oncogenic KRAS in driving cancer progression. Overall, these findings highlight a novel role for Survivin in mediating the cooperative actions of KRAS and MYC during malignant transformation and raise the possibility that targeting Survivin may offer therapeutic benefits against KRAS-driven cancers.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37387368": "INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: Vector diseases are common in Europe, including Poland. Every year, 77,000 Europeans are infected with transmissive diseases as a result of contact with infected vectors. In Poland, ticks are vectors of great epidemiological importance. The most important etiological factors causing disease in humans and transmitted by ticks include bacteria of the genus Borrelia and the species Francisella tularensis, Anaplasma phagophytophilum and Coxiella burnetii; as well as tick-borne encephalitis viruses. The level of the number of diagnosed cases of vector diseases in humans is influenced by environmental conditions, the most important of which is the COVID-19 pandemic that has been spreading for two years.\nOBJECTIVE: The aim of the review was to assess knowledge about tick-borne diseases in humans, as well as etiological factors, epidemiology of these diseases in Poland and other European countries. Infection with pathogens can occur both during recreation in nature and during work related to a profession. Professional groups include those particularly exposed to contact with vectors and pathogens - foresters, farmers and soldiers.\nREVIEW METHODS: A comprehensive assessment was conducted of extant publications.\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE STATE OF KNOWLEDGE: The results of the literature research revealed that in recent years an increase in the number of people suffering from tick-borne diseases has been recorded, possibly influenced by the changing climate. The vector diseases of the greatest importance for the inhabitants of Poland include Lyme disease and tick-borne encephalitis.\nSUMMARY: Soldiers, as a professional group who perform their duties in an environment where there is a high risk of exposure to infected ticks, are particularly at risk of acquiring transmission of vector diseases.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35190334": "Q fever is a global zoonotic infection caused by the intracellular Gram-negative bacterium Coxiella burnetii. Historically, it is considered a vector-borne disease, but the role of ticks in transmission has not fully been elucidated yet. Excretion of C. burnetii in tick feces and saliva is well documented but the role of these findings or the epidemiological context is discussed controversially. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of C. burnetii DNA in ticks to clarify the potential role of tick species for maintenance of C. burnetii infection. A literature review was performed using Google scholar, Agora, Science Direct, PubMed and Scopus to identify original studies on C. burnetii DNA presence in ticks. The search was limited to literature published from 2009 to 2020 in English and French and focused on data obtained by molecular detection of C. burnetii DNA in ticks. Overall, the prevalence of C. burnetii in ticks collected in Africa varied from 2.91% to 13.97%, in Europe from 2.46% to 10.52% and the Middle East from 4.76% to 12.53%. Ticks collected from animals showed a prevalence of 8% (95% CI: 6%-10%), followed by ticks collected from the environment and animals of 7% (95% CI: 5%-10%). C. burnetii DNA has been found in samples of many tick species with the highest prevalence in Rhipicephalus evertsi and Amblyomma variegatum. However, most of these studies did not include a differentiation between C. burnetii and Coxiella-like endosymbionts making it finally difficult to estimate the potential role that ticks play in the epidemiology of Q fever. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze the vector competence of different tick species to transmit C. burnetii. Knowledge of the vector and reservoir competence of ticks is important for taking adequate preventive measures to limit infection risks.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37866329": "Ticks are the main vectors for the transmission of bacterial, protist and viral pathogens in Europe affecting wildlife and domestic animals. However, some of them are zoonotic and can cause serious, sometimes fatal, problems in human health. A systematic review in PubMed/MEDLINE database was conducted to determine the spatial distribution and host and tick species ranges of a selection of tick-borne bacteria (Anaplasma spp., Borrelia spp., Coxiella spp., and Rickettsia spp.), protists (Babesia spp. and Theileria spp.), and viruses (Orthonairovirus, and flaviviruses tick-borne encephalitis virus and louping ill virus) on the European continent in a five-year period (November 2017 - November 2022). Only studies using PCR methods were selected, retrieving a total of 429 articles. Overall, up to 85 species of the selected tick-borne pathogens were reported from 36 European countries, and Anaplasma spp. was described in 37% (159/429) of the articles, followed by Babesia spp. (34%, 148/429), Borrelia spp. (34%, 147/429), Rickettsia spp. (33%, 142/429), Theileria spp. (11%, 47/429), tick-borne flaviviruses (9%, 37/429), Orthonairovirus (7%, 28/429) and Coxiella spp. (5%, 20/429). Host and tick ranges included 97 and 50 species, respectively. The highest tick-borne pathogen diversity was detected in domestic animals, and 12 species were shared between humans, wildlife, and domestic hosts, highlighting the following zoonotic species: Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Babesia divergens, Babesia microti, Borrelia afzelii, Borrelia burgdorferi s.s., Borrelia garinii, Borrelia miyamotoi, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, Coxiella burnetii, Rickettsia monacensis and tick-borne encephalitis virus.

We argue that, although ticks may readily transmit C. burnetii in experimental systems, they only occasionally transmit the pathogen in the field. Furthermore, we underscore that many Coxiella-like bacteria are widespread in ticks and may have been misidentified as C. burnetii. Our recommendation is to improve the methods currently used to detect and characterize C. burnetii, and we propose that further knowledge of Coxiella-like bacteria will yield new insights into Q fever evolutionary ecology and C. burnetii virulence factors.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33406079": "Q fever is a widespread zoonotic disease caused by the intracellular bacterium Coxiella burnetii.

However, recent observations revealed that endosymbionts of ticks have been commonly misidentified as C. burnetii, calling the importance of tick-borne transmission into question. In this study, we re-evaluated the vector competence of the African soft tick Ornithodoros moubata for an avirulent strain of C. burnetii. To this end, we used an artificial feeding system to initiate infection of ticks, specific molecular tools to monitor further infections, and culture assays in axenic and cell media to check for the viability of C. burnetii excreted by ticks. We observed typical traits associated with vector competence: The exposure to an infected blood meal resulted in viable and persistent infections in ticks, trans-stadial transmissions of infection from nymphs to adults and the ability of adult ticks to transmit infectious C. burnetii. However, in contrast to early studies, we found that infection differed substantially between tick organs. In addition, while adult female ticks were infected, we did not observe C. burnetii in eggs, suggesting that transovarial transmission is not effective. Finally, we detected only a sporadic presence of C. burnetii DNA in tick faeces, but no living bacterium was further isolated in culture assays, suggesting that excretion in faeces is not a common mode of transmission in O. moubata.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36946211": "INTRODUCTION: Methotrexate (MTX) is an antifolate and immunosuppressive drug prescribed for various malignancies and immune diseases. However, delayed elimination of MTX associated with concomitant use of some medications can lead to severe and lifethreatening adverse effects.\nAREAS COVERED: This paper investigated drugMTX interactions that lead to elevated MTX levels and related adverse effects due to the role of transporters. Methotrexate toxicity occurs at both low and high doses administrations. According to the studies we reviewed in this paper, most interaction records with methotrexate occurred with coadministration of indomethacin, ketoprofen, omeprazole, piperacillin/tazobactam, ciprofloxacin, cotrimoxazole, probenecid, and imatinib, mainly due to the role of transporters. However, most studies were performed as case reports or series, and confirming the exact drugmethotrexate interaction still needs further clinical investigations.\nEXPERT OPINION: Our findings showed no firm evidence of interactions of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), levetiracetam, and NSAIDS with MTX. Moreover, patients' risk factors, hypoalbuminemia, renal failure, third space fluid retention, the elderly, polypharmacy, and transport inhibition are the most critical factors for MTX toxicity.

Several cancers, including gastrointestinal, gynecological, breast, lung, and squamous cell head and neck cancers overexpress FR and are currently under investigation to correlate receptor status to disease state. Traditional chemotherapies have included antifolate medications, such as methotrexate and pemetrexed, which generate anticancer activity during the synthesis phase of the cell cycle. Increasingly, the repertoire of pharmacotherapies is expanding to include FR as a target, with a heterogenous pool of directed therapies.

In oncology, methotrexate is frequently administered at a high dose (>1 g/m(2)) and comes with various procedures to reduce the occurrence of toxicity and particularly to ensure optimal renal elimination. Drug-drug interactions involving methotrexate are the origin of severe side effects owing to delayed elimination of the antifolate and, more rarely, of decreased efficacy in relation to suboptimal exposure. Most of these interactions are driven by membrane drug transporters whose activity/expression can be inhibited by the interacting medication. In the last 10 years, research on drug transporters has permitted retrospective identification of the molecular mechanisms underlying drug-drug interactions with methotrexate. This article summarizes reported drug-drug interactions involving methotrexate in clinical oncology with reference to the role of drug transporters that control the disposition of the antifolate agent.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20579471": "Methotrexate (MTX) is an antimetabolite and antifolate drug used in the treatment of cancer and autoimmune diseases.

Cutaneous toxicity is usually dose-related and generally occurs when recommended guidelines are ignored or there is a decrease in renal excretion. Self-medication is a problem with unknown prevalence. Signs of MTX toxicity include bone marrow suppression, hepatotoxicity, and mucocutaneous toxicity. Painful erosions of psoriatic plaques and, less commonly, erosions in patients without psoriasis have been reported as an early sign of MTX toxicity.

Folate antagonists, purine analogues, and pyrimidine analogues are the three main categories of antimetabolites. Methotrexate, the most studied folate antagonist, is effective in many malignancies. Methotrexate inhibits dihydrofolate reductase, which leads to accumulation of polyglutamated folates, causing further inhibition of thymidylate synthase and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase. Subsequently, the lack of reduced folate substrates impairs synthesis of purine nucleotides, thymidylate, and certain amino acids, which can lead to cell death. However, methotrexate resistance develops through several mechanisms, including decreased folate carrier-mediated membrane transport, dihydrofolate reductase gene amplification, specific transcription-translational modifications, and downregulation of intracellular methotrexate polyglutamation. Antifolate drug development has focused on agents designed to overcome different aspects of methotrexate resistance. This article reviews the enzymatic targets for antifolates, describes the known mechanisms of antifolate resistance, and summarizes the current development of novel antifolate agents.

So far, the repurposing of drugs has been exercised heavily for the identification of therapeutic agents against COVID-19, which led FDA to approve many drugs for the same e.g., remdesivir, favipiravir, ribavirin, etc. The anti-COVID drugs explored via other approaches include nirmatrelvir (used in combination with ritonavir as Paxlovid), tixagevimab and cilgavimab (both used in combination with each other) and others. However, these approved drugs failed to achieve a significant clinical outcome. Globally, natural bioactive have also been explored for anti-COVID-19 effects, based on their traditional medicinal values. Although the clinical findings suggest that FDA-approved drugs and natural bioactives can help reducing the overall mortality rate but the significant clinical outcome was not achieved. Therefore, the focus has been shifted towards new drug development. In line with that, a lot of work has been done and still going on to explore heterocyclic compounds as potent anti- COVID-19 drugs. Several heterocyclic scaffolds have been previously reported with potent antiinflammatory, anticancer, anti-viral, antimicrobial and anti-tubercular effects. Few of them are under consideration for clinical trials whereas others are under preclinical investigation. Hence, this review discusses the evidence of rationally designed and tested heterocyclic compounds acting on different targets against COVID-19. The present article will help the researches and will serve as a pivotal resource in the design and development of novel anti-COVID-19 drugs.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37969744": "Paxlovid is a nirmatrelvir (NMV) and ritonavir (RTV) co-packaged medication used for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The active component of Paxlovid is NMV and RTV is a pharmacokinetic booster. Our work aimed to investigate the drug/herb-drug interactions associated with Paxlovid and provide mechanism-based guidance for the clinical use of Paxlovid. By using recombinant human cytochrome P450s (CYPs), we confirmed that CYP3A4 and 3A5 are the major enzymes responsible for NMV metabolism. The role of CYP3A in Paxlovid metabolism were further verified in Cyp3a-null mice, which showed that the deficiency of CYP3A significantly suppressed the metabolism of NMV and RTV. Pregnane X receptor (PXR) is a ligand-dependent transcription factor that upregulates CYP3A4/5 expression. We next explored the impact of drug- and herb-mediated PXR activation on Paxlovid metabolism in a transgenic mouse model expressing human PXR and CYP3A4/5. We found that PXR activation increased CYP3A4/5 expression, accelerated NMV metabolism, and reduced the systemic exposure of NMV. In summary, our work demonstrated that PXR activation can cause drug interactions with Paxlovid, suggesting that PXR-activating drugs and herbs should be used cautiously in COVID-19 patients receiving Paxlovid.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36181334": "One of the most recently described clinical associations with SARS-CoV-2 infection is rebound COVID-19, which occurs between five and eight days following the cessation of antiviral treatment. Most case reports of rebound COVID-19 have been associated with cessation of treatment with the combined oral antiviral agent nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid). On 24 May 2022, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a Health Alert Network (HAN) Health Advisory update for patients, healthcare providers, and public health departments on COVID-19 rebound or recurrence of COVID-19. However, population data from the US showed no significant differences in the risk of developing rebound COVID-19 between patients treated with Paxlovid and Molnupiravir. The mechanisms of rebound COVID-19 remain unclear but may involve the development of resistance to the antiviral drug, impaired immunity to the virus, or insufficient drug dosing. A further explanation may be the persistence of a high viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in individuals who are no longer symptomatic.

Approaches based on effect size estimates from each study are generally regarded as the most informative. However, these methods can only be used if comparable effect sizes can be computed from each study, and this may not be the case due to variation in how the studies were done or limitations in how their results were reported. Other methods, such as vote counting, are then used to summarize the results of these studies, but most of these methods are limited in that they do not provide any indication of the magnitude of effect. We propose a novel plot, the albatross plot, which requires only a 1-sided P value and a total sample size from each study (or equivalently a 2-sided P value, direction of effect and total sample size). The plot allows an approximate examination of underlying effect sizes and the potential to identify sources of heterogeneity across studies. This is achieved by drawing contours showing the range of effect sizes that might lead to each P value for given sample sizes, under simple study designs. We provide examples of albatross plots using data from previous meta-analyses, allowing for comparison of results, and an example from when a meta-analysis was not possible.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34035181": "The published evidence on whether workplace health and well-being interventions are as effective in male-dominated industries compared with mixed-gender environments has not been synthesised. We performed a systematic review of workplace interventions aimed at improving employee health and well-being in male-dominated industries. We searched Web of Knowledge, PubMed, Medline, Cochrane Database and Web of Science for articles describing workplace interventions in male-dominated industries that address employee health and well-being. The primary outcome was to determine the effectiveness of the intervention and the process evaluation (intervention delivery and adherence). To assess the quality of evidence, Cochrane Collaboration's Risk of Bias Tool was used. Due to the heterogeneity of reported outcomes, meta-analysis was performed for only some outcomes and a narrative synthesis with albatross plots was presented. After full-text screening, 35 studies met the eligibility criteria. Thirty-two studies delivered the intervention face-to-face, while two were delivered via internet and one using postal mail. Intervention adherence ranged from 50% to 97%, dependent on mode of delivery and industry. 17 studies were considered low risk of bias. Albatross plots indicated some evidence of positive associations, particularly for interventions focusing on musculoskeletal disorders. There was little evidence of intervention effect on body mass index and systolic or diastolic blood pressure. Limited to moderate evidence of beneficial effects was found for workplace health and well-being interventions conducted within male-dominated industries.

Parents are assumed to play an important role in influencing children's PA. Earlier reviews have mainly focused on parental modelling, encouragement, and support for PA, rather than the actual PA levels of parents. Therefore, the purpose of this review was to systematically summarize the evidence on the relationship between parent and child PA.\nMETHODS: Papers were identified using electronic databases and manual searches of reference lists. Papers reporting on associations between objectively measured child PA and at least one measure of parental PA were included. The quality of the papers was assessed using a modified version of the ROBINS-I tool. For interpretation of the results across studies, we produced albatross plots for all studies combined and by age-groups, sex of the parents, sex of the child, methodology of assessment of parental PA, and type of PA.\nRESULTS: Thirty-nine papers were included with sample size of parent-child dyads ranging from 15 to 1267 (mean\u2009=\u2009319 dyads, median\u2009=\u2009227 dyads). The majority of studies were published from 2008 to 2018 and used accelerometry to assess PA. Most of the studies were classified as having moderate, serious, or critical risk of bias. The albatross plot for all studies combined showed that the clear majority of studies observed a positive relationship between parent and child PA. The plot suggested an average magnitude of correlation across studies to be around 0.13, and the overall impression was that this was fairly similar across child age-groups and gender of parent-child dyads. Studies using objective assessment of parental PA showed stronger relationship between parent and child PA compared with studies using self-report (average magnitude of correlation around 0.16 vs 0.04 respectively). No clear evidence was found for the strength of relationship being dependent on type of PA measure of parent and child (total PA, moderate-to-vigorous PA, steps), however, the relationship for light PA appeared weaker.\nCONCLUSION: This systematic review showed that the clear majority of studies observed a weak positive relationship between parent and child PA regardless of age of the child, the gender of the parent-child dyad, and type of PA.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: Registration in PROSPERO: CRD42019093462.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33771150": "BACKGROUND: Opioid related overdoses and overdose deaths continue to constitute an urgent public health crisis. The implementation of naloxone programs, such as 'take-home naloxone' (THN), has emerged as a key intervention in reducing opioid overdose deaths. These programs aim to train individuals at risk of witnessing or experiencing an opioid overdose to recognize an opioid overdose and respond with naloxone. Naloxone effectively reverses opioid overdoses on a physiological level; however, there are outstanding questions on community THN program effectiveness (adverse events, dosing requirements, dose-response between routes of administration) and implementation (accessibility, availability, and affordability). The objective of this scoping review is to identify existing systematic reviews and best practice guidelines relevant to clinical and operational guidance on the distribution of THN.\nMETHODS: Using the Arksey & O'Malley framework for scoping reviews, we searched both academic literature and grey literature databases using keywords (Naloxone) AND (Overdose) AND (Guideline OR Review OR Recommendation OR Toolkit). Only documents which had a structured review of evidence and/or provided summaries or recommendations based on evidence were included (systematic reviews, meta-analyses, scoping reviews, short-cut or rapid reviews, practice/clinical guidelines, and reports). Data were extracted from selected evidence in two key areas: (1) study identifiers; and (2) methodological characteristics.\nRESULTS: A total of 47 articles met inclusion criteria: 20 systematic reviews; 10 grey literature articles; 8 short-cut or rapid reviews; 4 scoping reviews; and 5 other review types (e.g. mapping review and comprehensive reviews). The most common subject themes were: naloxone effectiveness, safety, provision feasibility/acceptability of naloxone distribution, dosing and routes of administration, overdose response after naloxone administration, cost-effectiveness, naloxone training and education, and recommendations for policy, practice and gaps in knowledge.\nCONCLUSIONS: Several recent systematic reviews address the effectiveness of take-home naloxone programs, naloxone dosing/route of administration, and naloxone provision models. Gaps remain in the evidence around evaluating cost-effectiveness, training parameters and strategies, and adverse events following naloxone administration. As THN programs continue to expand in response to opioid overdose deaths, this review will contribute to understanding the evidence base for policy and THN program development and expansion.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31420089": "Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a chronic, relapsing condition, often associated with legal, interpersonal, and employment problems. Medications demonstrated to be effective for OUD are methadone (a full opioid agonist), buprenorphine (a partial agonist), and naltrexone (an opioid antagonist). Methadone and buprenorphine act by suppressing opioid withdrawal symptoms and attenuating the effects of other opioids. Naltrexone blocks the effects of opioid agonists. Oral methadone has the strongest evidence for effectiveness. Longer duration of treatment allows restoration of social connections and is associated with better outcomes. Treatments for OUD may be limited by poor adherence to treatment recommendations and by high rates of relapse and increased risk of overdose after leaving treatment. Treatment with methadone and buprenorphine has the additional risk of diversion and misuse of medication. New depot and implant formulations of buprenorphine and naltrexone have been developed to address issues of safety and problems of poor treatment adherence. For people with OUD who do not respond to these treatments, there is accumulating evidence for supervised injectable opioid treatment (prescribing pharmaceutical heroin). Another medication mode of minimizing risk of overdose is take-home naloxone. Naloxone is an opioid antagonist used to reverse opioid overdose, and take-home naloxone programs aim to prevent fatal overdose. All medication-assisted treatment is limited by lack of access and by stigma. In seeking to stem the rising toll from OUD, expanding access to approved treatment such as methadone, for which there remains the best evidence of efficacy, may be the most useful approach.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36123614": "BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has amplified the need for wide deployment of effective harm reduction strategies in preventing opioid overdose mortality. Placing naloxone in the hands of key responders, including law enforcement officers who are often first on the scene of a suspected overdose, is one such strategy. New York State (NYS) was one of the first states to implement a statewide law enforcement naloxone administration program. This article provides an overview of the law enforcement administration of naloxone in NYS between 2015 and 2020 and highlights key characteristics of over 9000 opioid overdose reversal events.\nMETHODS: Data in naloxone usage report forms completed by police officers were compiled and analyzed. Data included 9133 naloxone administration reports by 5835 unique officers located in 60 counties across NYS. Descriptive statistics were used to examine attributes of the aided individuals, including differences between fatal and non-fatal incidents. Additional descriptive analyses were conducted for incidents in which law enforcement officers arrived first at the scene of suspected overdose. Comparisons were made to examine year-over-year trends in administration as naloxone formulations were changed. Quantitative analysis was supplemented by content analysis of officers' notes (n\u2009=\u20092192).\nRESULTS: In 85.9% of cases, law enforcement officers arrived at the scene of a suspected overdose prior to emergency medical services (EMS) personnel. These officers assessed the likelihood of an opioid overdose having occurred based on the aided person's breathing status and other information obtained on the scene. They administered an average of 2 doses of naloxone to aided individuals. In 36.8% of cases, they reported additional administration of naloxone by other responders including EMS, fire departments, and laypersons. Data indicated the aided survived the suspected overdose in 87.4% of cases.\nCONCLUSIONS: With appropriate training, law enforcement personnel were able to recognize opioid overdoses and prevent fatalities by administering naloxone and carrying out time-sensitive medical interventions. These officers provided life-saving services to aided individuals alongside other responders including EMS, fire departments, and bystanders. Further expansion of law enforcement naloxone administration nationally and internationally could help decrease opioid overdose mortality.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33682423": "Opioid overdose is the leading cause of death for Americans 25 to 64 years of age, and opioid use disorder affects >2 million Americans. The epidemiology of opioid-associated out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in the United States is changing rapidly, with exponential increases in death resulting from synthetic opioids and linear increases in heroin deaths more than offsetting modest reductions in deaths from prescription opioids. The pathophysiology of polysubstance toxidromes involving opioids, asphyxial death, and prolonged hypoxemia leading to global ischemia (cardiac arrest) differs from that of sudden cardiac arrest. People who use opioids may also develop bacteremia, central nervous system vasculitis and leukoencephalopathy, torsades de pointes, pulmonary vasculopathy, and pulmonary edema. Emergency management of opioid poisoning requires recognition by the lay public or emergency dispatchers, prompt emergency response, and effective ventilation coupled to compressions in the setting of opioid-associated out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Effective ventilation is challenging to teach, whereas naloxone, an opioid antagonist, can be administered by emergency medical personnel, trained laypeople, and the general public with dispatcher instruction to prevent cardiac arrest. Opioid education and naloxone distributions programs have been developed to teach people who are likely to encounter a person with opioid poisoning how to administer naloxone, deliver high-quality compressions, and perform rescue breathing. Current American Heart Association recommendations call for laypeople and others who cannot reliably establish the presence of a pulse to initiate cardiopulmonary resuscitation in any individual who is unconscious and not breathing normally; if opioid overdose is suspected, naloxone should also be administered. Secondary prevention, including counseling, opioid overdose education with take-home naloxone, and medication for opioid use disorder, is important to prevent recurrent opioid overdose.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30924736": "The opioid crisis is a growing concern for Americans, and it has become the leading cause of injury-related death in the United States. An adjunct to respiratory support that can reduce this high mortality rate is the administration of naloxone by Emergency Medical Services (EMS) practitioners for patients with suspected opioid overdose. However, clear evidence-based guidelines to direct EMS use of naloxone for opioid overdose have not been developed. Leveraging the recent Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) systematic review on the EMS administration of naloxone for opioid poisonings, federal partners determined the need for a clinical practice guideline for EMS practitioners faced with suspected opioid poisoning. Project funding was provided by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Office of EMS, (NHTSA OEMS), and the Health Resources and Services Administration, Maternal and Child Health Bureau's EMS for Children Program (EMSC). The objectives of this project were to develop and disseminate an evidence-based guideline and model protocol for administration of naloxone by EMS practitioners to persons with suspected opioid overdose. We have four recommendations relating to route of administration, all conditional, and all supported by low or very low certainty of evidence. We recommend the intravenous route of administration to facilitate titration of dose, and disfavor the intramuscular route due to difficulty with titration, slower time to clinical effect, and potential exposure to needles. We equally recommend the intranasal and intravenous routes of administration, while noting there are variables which will determine which route is best for each patient. Where we are unable to make recommendations due to evidence limitations (dosing, titration, timing, and transport) we offer technical remarks. Limitations of our work include the introduction of novel synthetic opioids after many of the reviewed papers were produced, which may affect the dose of naloxone required for effect, high risk of bias and imprecision in the reviewed papers, and the introduction of new naloxone administration devices since many of the reviewed papers were published.

Sparsentan significantly delayed onset of glomerulosclerosis, interstitial fibrosis, proteinuria, and glomerular filtration rate decline. Sparsentan attenuated glomerular basement membrane defects, blunted mesangial filopodial invasion into the glomerular capillaries, increased lifespan more than losartan, and lessened changes in profibrotic/pro-inflammatory gene pathways in both the glomerular and the renal cortical compartments. Notably, treatment with sparsentan, but not losartan, prevented accumulation of extracellular matrix in the strial capillary basement membranes in the inner ear and reduced susceptibility to hearing loss.

The pathogenic antibodies mostly belong to the immunoglobulin subclass (Ig)G4, a feature which attributes them their specific properties and pathogenic profile. On the other hand, acetylcholine receptor (AChR) MG, the most prevalent form of MG, is characterized by immunoglobulin (Ig)G1 and IgG3 antibodies to the AChR. IgG4 class autoantibodies are impotent to fix complement and only weakly bind Fc-receptors expressed on immune cells and exert their pathogenicity via interfering with the interaction between their targets and binding partners (e.g. between MuSK and LRP4). Cardinal differences between AChR and MuSK-MG are the thymus involvement (not prominent in MuSK-MG), the distinct HLA alleles, and core immunopathological patterns of pathology in neuromuscular junction, structure, and function. In MuSK-MG, classical treatment options are usually less effective (e.g. IVIG) with the need for prolonged and high doses of steroids difficult to be tapered to control symptoms. Exceptional clinical response to plasmapheresis and rituximab has been particularly observed in these patients. Reduction of antibody titers follows the clinical efficacy of anti-CD20 therapies, a feature implying the role of short-lived plasma cells (SLPB) in autoantibody production. Novel therapeutic monoclonal against B cells at different stages of their maturation (like plasmablasts), or against molecules involved in B cell activation, represent promising therapeutic targets. A revolution in autoantibody-mediated diseases is pharmacological interference with the neonatal Fc receptor, leading to a rapid reduction of circulating IgGs (including autoantibodies), an approach already suitable for AChR-MG and promising for MuSK-MG. New precision medicine approaches involve Chimeric autoantibody receptor T (CAAR-T) cells that are engineered to target antigen-specific B cells in MuSK-MG and represent a milestone in the development of targeted immunotherapies. This review aims to provide a detailed update on the pathomechanisms involved in MuSK-MG (cellular and humoral aberrations), fostering the understanding of the latest indications regarding the efficacy of different treatment strategies.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35967183": "Introduction Fever is the most common presenting symptom in children and causes distress in patients and parents. Although nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly used as antipyretics, they should be reserved for pain or chronic inflammatory conditions due to safety concerns. If we can safely achieve the same antipyretic effect using a higher dose (20 mg/kg) of paracetamol, NSAIDs may be avoided for treating fever. There is a paucity of literature comparing the antipyretic effect of mefenamic acid and high-dose paracetamol. We hypothesized that there would be no difference in the antipyretic effect of high-dose paracetamol and mefenamic acid. Methods In this randomized control trial, 165 febrile children were randomly allocated to one of the following three groups: standard-dose (15 mg/kg) paracetamol (SDPCM) as the control group and high-dose (20 mg/kg) paracetamol (HDPCM) and mefenamic acid (6 mg/kg) (MFN) as the intervention groups. The temperature was measured using a digital thermometer at the start of drug dosage and every 15 minutes until it reached normal. One-way between-group analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare outcome measures such as time for\u00a0temperature to reach normal, fall of temperature in 60 minutes, and time for the next fever. Post hoc analysis was performed to compare mean differences. Patients were monitored for adverse effects. Results Out of 165 enrolled patients, 159 were analyzed. The baseline demographic data were comparable among the groups. There was a statistically significant difference in the mean time taken for the temperature to reach normal (F-value (F) (2,156)=3.184, p<0.05) and the mean reduction in temperature at 60 minutes (F (2,156)=23.40, p<0.001) among the groups. The mean time for temperature to reach normal in the\u00a0SDPCM group (97.50\u00b126.60 minutes) was longer than that in the HDPCM\u00a0(85.09\u00b131.43 minutes) and MFN\u00a0(84.90\u00b130.42 minutes) groups. The decrease in temperature over 60 minutes was greater in the HDPCM (0.46\u00b0C\u00b10.19\u00b0C) and MFN (0.45\u00b0C\u00b10.11\u00b0C) groups than in the SDPCM (0.33\u00b0C\u00b10.10\u00b0C) group. The time to the next fever spike was shorter for the SDPCM\u00a0group (5.07\u00b12.66 hours) than for the HDPCM (7.20\u00b13.08 hours) and MFN (8.82\u00b13.83 hours) groups. Post hoc analysis demonstrated that high-dose paracetamol and mefenamic acid had similar and faster antipyretic effects than standard-dose paracetamol. Although the duration of action was found to be longer in the mefenamic acid group, the difference was not statistically significant. There were negligible adverse effects in the groups. Conclusion\u00a0 Standard-dose paracetamol (15 mg/kg/dose) had a slower and shorter antipyretic effect than high-dose paracetamol (20 mg/kg/dose) and mefenamic acid (6 mg/kg/dose). A single dose of high-dose paracetamol was safe and had a similar antipyretic effect as mefenamic acid. Mefenamic acid may be avoided as an antipyretic and spared for pain and anti-inflammatory indications.

The overall aim of the present publication was to overview guidance and provide an algorithm for use in the emergency setting as well as recommendations to inform parents for home care. To obtain consensus, a core steering committee drafted a management algorithm and general consensus was obtained by remote voting among experts. A number of common messages are found in current guidelines: management of fever depends on age, antipyretics are indicated only for discomfort; paracetamol or ibuprofen can be recommended; physical methods for lowering temperature are discouraged. A consensus algorithm is presented in which infants <28 days are considered separately, while those >28 days and <90 days are divided into those ill or well appearing. All infants <28 days with fever \u226537.5 \u00b0C should undergo complete work-up for sepsis, strongly considered to receive empirical antibiotics \u00b1 acyclovir, and be hospitalized. All infants (between 28 and 90 days) ill appearing should undergo diagnostic work-up for sepsis, receive empirical antibiotics, and be hospitalized. In well appearing infants, diagnostic work-up should be carried out to decide admission to hospital and administration of antibiotics. Specific recommendations are also given for home discharge that can be used to inform parents about the actions to take during home care in the attempt to reinforce existing guidelines.

Currently there are no guidelines for assessment and management of fever specifically for community and primary healthcare workers in the sub-Saharan Africa region. This multidisciplinary consensus guide was developed to assist pharmacists and primary healthcare workers in sub-Saharan Africa to risk stratify and manage children who present with fever, decide when to refer, and how to advise parents and caregivers. Fever is defined as body temperature \u2265\u00a037.5\u00a0\u00b0C and is a normal physiological response to illness that facilitates and accelerates recovery. Although it is often associated with self-limiting illness, it causes significant concern to both parents and attending healthcare workers. Clinical signs may be used by pharmacy staff and primary healthcare workers to determine level of distress and to distinguish between a child with fever who is at high risk of serious illness and who requires specific treatment, hospitalisation or specialist care, and those at low risk who could be managed conservatively at home. In children with warning signs, serious causes of fever that may need to be excluded include infections (including malaria), non-infective inflammatory conditions and malignancy. Simple febrile convulsions are not in themselves harmful, and are not necessarily indicative of serious infection. In the absence of illness requiring specific treatment, relief from distress is the primary indication for prescribing pharmacotherapy, and antipyretics should not be administered with the sole intention of reducing body temperature. Care must be taken not to overdose medications and clear instructions should be given to parents/caregivers on managing the child at home and when to seek further medical care.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9578327": "Entering both the old dispute (whether fever is adaptive or maladaptive) and its more recent modification (whether hypothermia is protective or detrimental in systemic inflammation), we suggest a new solution. We hypothesize that fever and hypothermia represent two different strategies of fighting systemic inflammation, each developed as an adaptive response to certain conditions, and each beneficial under these conditions. The antimicrobial and immunostimulating benefits of a high body temperature could be easily offset by its high energy cost. Fever, therefore, is protective only when there is no immediate threat of a substantial energy deficit. Hypothermia, on the other hand, constitutes a response aimed at energy conservation and, as such, is beneficial exactly under the conditions of a substantial energy deficit. The two thermoregulatory responses represent two complementary strategies of survival in systemic inflammation: fever ensures the active attack against the pathogen; hypothermia secures the defense of the host's vital systems. The importance of each response's contribution to the whole campaign depends on the severity of the pathogenic insult, premorbid pathology, and current conditions (stress, nutrition, ambient temperature, etc.).", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33738101": "Although fever is one of the main presenting symptoms of COVID-19 infection, little public attention has been given to fever as an evolved defense. Fever, the regulated increase in the body temperature, is part of the evolved systemic reaction to infection known as the acute phase response. The heat of fever augments the performance of immune cells, induces stress on pathogens and infected cells directly, and combines with other stressors to provide a nonspecific immune defense. Observational trials in humans suggest a survival benefit from fever, and randomized trials published before COVID-19 do not support fever reduction in patients with infection. Like public health measures that seem burdensome and excessive, fevers involve costly trade-offs but they can prevent infection from getting out of control. For infections with novel SARS-CoV-2, the precautionary principle applies: unless evidence suggests otherwise, we advise that fever should be allowed to run its course. Lay summary: For COVID-19, many public health organizations have advised treating fever with medicines such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Even though this is a common practice, lowering body temperature has not improved survival in laboratory animals or in patients with infections. Blocking fever can be harmful because fever, along with other sickness symptoms, evolved as a defense against infection. Fever works by causing more damage to pathogens and infected cells than it does to healthy cells in the body.

The patient's medical history was significant for poorly controlled HIV. Imaging demonstrated a large mass in the rectum and the patient was admitted to the colorectal surgery service for management of presumed rectal cancer. Sigmoidoscopy demonstrated a rectal stricture and biopsies showed severe proctitis without evidence for malignancy. Given the patient's history and discordant clinical findings an infectious workup was pursued. The patient tested positive for syphilis and was diagnosed with syphilitic proctitis. He underwent treatment with penicillin and although he experienced a Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction, his bowel obstruction completely resolved. Final pathology on the rectal biopsies demonstrated positive Warthin-Starry and spirochete immunohistochemical stain.\nDISCUSSION: This case illustrates key aspects in the care of a patient with syphilitic proctitis mimicking an obstructing rectal cancer, including the need for high clinical suspicion, thorough evaluation including sexual and sexually transmitted disease history, multidisciplinary communication, and management of the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction.\nCONCLUSION: Severe proctitis leading to large bowel obstruction is a possible presentation of syphilis, and a high degree of clinical suspicion is necessary to be able to accurately identify the cause.

Neuropsychiatric adverse effects of domperidone such as akathisia and depression are previously described. It has never been reported to be associated with infanticide ideation. The aim of this article is to discuss the occurrence of infanticide ideation following domperidone usage in an adoptive mother and the potential mechanisms by which these may occur. Methods: With Institutional Review Board approval, we herein report a nulliparous adoptive mother who developed infanticide ideation after 3 months of exposure to domperidone. The infanticide ideation was intrusive, recurrent, ego-dystonic, causing significant depressive symptoms and affecting the patient's functions. Physical examination and relevant biological investigations were unremarkable. Results: The patient is treated as domperidone-induced obsessional thought with adjustment disorder. The domperidone was stopped immediately. Serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors was started. The infanticide ideation gradually resolved and patient achieved complete remission after 10 months of treatment. Conclusion: The infanticide ideation following consumption of domperidone is a potential neuropsychiatric adverse event that warrants further examination into the safety of domperidone as an \"off-labeled\" galactagogue.

Conclusion: Domperidone as a galactagogue may pose a significant psychiatric risk upon discontinuation. This presentation is commonly confused with, but clinically distinct from, postpartum depression. Lactating mothers who present with psychiatric symptoms should be explicitly probed about domperidone use, even in areas where domperidone is not authorized for use.

Complications of OCD include interpersonal difficulties, unemployment, substance abuse, criminal justice issues, and physical injuries. Areas of the brain involved in the pathophysiology include the orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate gyrus, and basal ganglia.

In this study, we utilized magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) in an effort to provide a better understanding of the role of brain gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate in the pathophysiology of OCD. We hypothesized that beyond the separate effects of these neurotransmitter systems, a disruption in the balance between GABA and glutamate could be particularly relevant to OCD.\nMETHODS: We obtained MRS measures of GABA and glutamate concentrations in the anterior cingulate cortex from 23 adult patients with OCD and 20 sex- and age-matched healthy community volunteers. Established clinical rating scales were used to assess the severities of OCD, anxiety, and depression symptoms. Statistical analysis involved the assessment of patient-control group differences in the individual measures of GABA and glutamate, as well as in the ratio of the GABA to glutamate measures. Additionally, we explored whether differences in the MRS measures existed between two subgroups of patients formed according to the severity of their OCD symptoms. Finally, we assessed the relations of demographic and clinical variables to the MRS measures.\nRESULTS: Patients with OCD displayed a higher estimated GABA level and a higher GABA to glutamate ratio than healthy participants, but no significant group differences were observed in the measure of glutamate. The MRS measures did not vary by subgroup and showed no correlations with demographic and clinical variables.\nCONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that GABA abnormalities within the anterior cingulate cortex contribute to the pathophysiology of OCD. The results fail to provide evidence that glutamate abnormalities alone are involved in adult OCD.

Although advanced extraction approaches have been applied to some clinical research reviews, existing methods are not well suited for addressing toxicology or environmental health questions due to unique data needs to support reviews in these fields.\nOBJECTIVES: To develop and evaluate a flexible, web-based tool for semi-automated data extraction that: 1) makes data extraction predictions with user verification, 2) integrates token-level annotations, and 3) connects extracted entities to support hierarchical data extraction.\nMETHODS: Dextr was developed with Agile software methodology using a two-team approach. The development team outlined proposed features and coded the software. The advisory team guided developers and evaluated Dextr's performance on precision, recall, and extraction time by comparing a manual extraction workflow to a semi-automated extraction workflow using a dataset of 51 environmental health animal studies.\nRESULTS: The semi-automated workflow did not appear to affect precision rate (96.0% vs. 95.4% manual, p\u00a0=\u00a00.38), resulted in a small reduction in recall rate (91.8% vs. 97.0% manual, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01), and substantially reduced the median extraction time (436\u00a0s vs. 933\u00a0s per study manual, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) compared to a manual workflow.\nDISCUSSION: Dextr provides similar performance to manual extraction in terms of recall and precision and greatly reduces data extraction time. Unlike other tools, Dextr provides the ability to extract complex concepts (e.g., multiple experiments with various exposures and doses within a single study), properly connect the extracted elements within a study, and effectively limit the work required by researchers to generate machine-readable, annotated exports. The Dextr tool addresses data-extraction challenges associated with environmental health sciences literature with a simple user interface, incorporates the key capabilities of user verification and entity connecting, provides a platform for further automation developments, and has the potential to improve data extraction for literature reviews in this and other fields.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32856160": "The use of primary care electronic health records for research is abundant. The benefits gained from utilising such records lies in their size, longitudinal data collection and data quality. However, the use of such data to undertake high quality epidemiological studies, can lead to significant challenges particularly in dealing with misclassification, variation in coding and the significant effort required to pre-process the data in a meaningful format for statistical analysis. In this paper, we describe a methodology to aid with the extraction and processing of such databases, delivered by a novel software programme; the \"Data extraction for epidemiological research\" (DExtER). The basis of DExtER relies on principles of extract, transform and load processes. The tool initially provides the ability for the healthcare dataset to be extracted, then transformed in a format whereby data is normalised, converted and reformatted. DExtER has a user interface designed to obtain data extracts specific to each research question and observational study design. There are facilities to input the requirements for; eligible study period, definition of exposed and unexposed groups, outcome measures and important baseline covariates. To date the tool has been utilised and validated in a multitude of settings. There have been over 35 peer-reviewed publications using the tool, and DExtER has been implemented as a validated public health surveillance tool for obtaining accurate statistics on epidemiology of key morbidities. Future direction of this work will be the application of the framework to linked as well as international datasets and the development of standardised methods for conducting electronic pre-processing and extraction from datasets for research purposes.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37402676": "Records of secondary hydrocephalus patients undergoing shunt surgery in the Department of Neurosurgery of Peking Union Medical College Hospital from September 2012 to April 2022 and their clinical characteristics and outcomes were retrospectively reviewed and analyzed. Among 121 patients who received first time shunt placement, the most common causes of secondary hydrocephalus were brain hemorrhage (55, 45.5%) and trauma (35, 28.9%). Cognition decline (106, 87.6%), abnormal gait (50, 41.3%) and incontinence (40, 33.1%) were the most prevalent manifestations.

Gravitation-assisted shunt valves are designed to prevent hydrostatic over-drainage frequently observed in the long course of shunt-treated hydrocephalus. We prospectively studied and analyzed the implication, safety, and feasibility for an adjustable gravitational unit combined with a fixed differential-pressure (DP) valve for neonates and infants primary shunted within the first 12 months of life.\nMETHODS: Clinical course of hydrocephalic neonates and infants who received initial VP-shunt insertion in the early post-natal phase were monitored prospectively on the basis of our digital institutional Hydrocephalus & Shunt Registry. All patients were equipped with a fixed DP valve combined with a programmable gravitational unit activated in upright body position. Patients with a minimum shunt follow-up of 24 months were considered for further statistical analysis regarding hydrocephalus etiology, surgical setting, pre- and post-operative ventricular enlargement, head circumference, valve pressure setting, implication for the adjustment option of the gravitational unit, type and number of shunt complications, and revision-free shunt and valve survival.\nRESULTS: Seventy-eight pediatric patients received primary VP-shunt insertion at a mean age of 10 weeks with age gestationally corrected for preterm neonates. Hydrocephalus was related to perinatal IVH (64%), CNS malformation (11%), spina bifida (9%), congenital aqueductal stenosis (9%), and idiopathic (4%) or post-infectious etiology (3%). Fifty-two patients (70%) presented with history of prematurity (gestational age 23-36 weeks). Regular follow-up carried out for a mean period of 63 months demonstrated that ventricular enlargement decreased significantly after applied treatment and excessive head growth could be counteracted effectively. At least one pressure level adjustment was performed in 31% of all patients after 12 months, in 42% after 24 months, and in 64% at the time of last clinical follow-up since initial shunt insertion. Pressure level adjustments were successful in cases of clinical or radiographic signs of under- or over-drainage for individual patients of various ages during entire clinical course. Mean pressure setting for upright position was 24.1 cm H<sub>2</sub>O at the time of initial shunt insertion and increased to 26.4 cmH<sub>2</sub>O at the time of last clinical follow-up. Revision-free shunt-survival rates after 12 and 24 months were 79% and 70% and valve-survival rates 91% and 90%, respectively.\nCONCLUSION: The combination of a fixed DP valve with an adjustable gravitational unit utilized as first-line shunt regimen was feasible and safe in a highly vulnerable subgroup of hydrocephalic infants. The adjustment option for the gravitational unit showed frequent and increasing implication over time and was beneficial even during the very early developmental stage of limited autonomous mobility.

Though effective, shunts are associated with risk of dysfunction leading to multiple surgical revisions, affecting patient quality-of-life and incurring high healthcare costs. There is a need for ambulatory monitoring systems for life-long assessment of shunt status. The present study aimed to develop a preclinical model assessing the feasibility of our wireless device for continuous monitoring of cerebral pressure in shunts.\nMETHODS: We first adapted a previous hydrocephalus model in sheep, which used an intracisternal kaolin injection. Seven animals were used to establish the model, and 1 sheep with naturally dilated ventricles was used as control. Hydrocephalus was confirmed by clinical examination and brain imaging before inserting the ventriculoperitoneal shunts and the monitoring device allowing continuous measurement of the pressure through the shunt for a few days in 3 sheep. An external ventricular drain was used as gold standard.\nRESULTS: Our results showed that a reduction in kaolin dose associated to postoperative management was crucial to reduce morbidity and mortality rates in the model. Ventriculomegaly was confirmed by imaging 4 days after injection of 75mg kaolin into the cisterna magna. For the implanted sheep, recordings revealed high sensitivity of our sensor in detecting fluctuations in cerebral pressure compared to conventional measurements.\nCONCLUSIONS: This proof-of-concept study highlights the potential of this preclinical model for testing new shunt devices.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21961546": "Ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt placement is the most common surgical treatment for hydrocephalus.

Laparoscopic shunt placement has been associated with decreased operating time, less blood loss, and shorter hospital stays. The authors describe a single-incision laparoscopic shunt (SILS) insertion technique that facilitates directed placement of the peritoneal portion of the catheter in children. A total of 6 pediatric patients underwent the SILS procedure between December 2008 and March 2009. This cohort included 5 girls and 1 boy; the average age was 6 years (range 1 day-16 years). One patient had previously undergone a VP shunt placement, but all other patients were undergoing the initial creation of their shunt. The most common pathological condition encountered was posttraumatic hydrocephalus (2 patients). All patients underwent successful placement of the peritoneal catheters. All catheters were seen to have CSF flowing freely within the peritoneal space. The authors' recent experience shows that SILS placement is safe and feasible in children.

A retrospective institutional analysis and review of patient records in those who had undergone PFL surgery was performed. In so doing, the authors identified patients that went on to develop post-operative hydrocephalus. The study included pediatric and adult patients treated between 2009 and 2017. Fifteen of 40 pediatric (37.5%) and 18 of 262 adult (6.9%) patients developed hydrocephalus after PFL surgery.

Microglia, the primary immune cells in the brain, undergo rapid activation and phenotypic polarization, which are crucial for regulating neuroinflammatory responses following ischemic stroke. Melatonin is a promising neuroprotective agent that can regulate microglial polarization in central nervous system (CNS) diseases. However, the specific mechanism underlying the neuroprotective effects of melatonin against ischemic stroke-induced brain injury by modulating microglial polarization after ischemic stroke remains poorly understood. To investigate this mechanism, we used the transient middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (tMCAO/R) model in C57BL/6 mice to induce ischemic stroke and administered intraperitoneal melatonin (20\u00a0mg/kg) or an equivalent volume of vehicle daily after reperfusion. Our results demonstrated that melatonin treatment reduced the infarct volume, prevented neuronal loss and apoptosis, and improved neurological deficits after ischemic stroke. Furthermore, melatonin attenuated microglial activation and reactive astrogliosis, while promoting the polarization of microglia toward M2 phenotype via signal transducer and activator of transcription 1/6 (STAT1/6) pathways. Collectively, these findings suggest that melatonin exerts neuroprotective effects against ischemic stroke-induced brain injury by modulating microglial polarization toward M2 phenotype and has the potential as a promising candidate for the treatment of ischemic stroke.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37321200": "INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to investigate how melatonin administration for 3 days or 7 days following cerebral ischemia (CI) injury would affect autophagy and, therefore, survival in neurons of the penumbra region.

After the start of reperfusion, the groups were treated with melatonin (10 mg/kg/day) for 3 days or 7 days. In all groups, neurological deficit scoring, rotarod, and adhesive removal tests were executed during reperfusion. Infarct areas were determined by TTC (2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride) staining at the end of the 3rd and 7th days of reperfusion. Beclin-1, LC3, p62, and caspase-3 protein levels were assessed using Western blot and immunofluorescence methods in the brain tissues.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of melatonin on CCH-induced AD pathology, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and synaptic plasticity, all of which are correlated with the activation of oxidative stress, apoptosis, and cognitive impairment. CCH was induced in male Wistar rats by bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (2VO).

Unless ischemia is promptly reversed, reperfusion produces further cerebral damage. Acute thrombolysis or defibrinogenation is effective only in selective patients with ischemic stroke and carries a significant risk of bleeding complications. Whereas numerous neuroprotectants were shown to be effective in experimental studies, none of them have been shown to work in clinical trials. The major pathogenetic mechanisms of ischemia/reperfusion injury include excitotoxicity, disturbed calcium ion homeostasis, overproduction of nitric oxide and other free radicals, inflammation, and apoptosis. Nitric oxide and other free radicals, the key mediators of excitotoxicity and disturbed calcium ion homeostasis, cause direct injury and also indirectly damage via inflammation and apoptosis. Melatonin is a potent free radical scavenger and an indirect antioxidant. This mini review summarizes the in vivo and in vitro evidence that melatonin protects against ischemia/reperfusion injury. There is convincing evidence from the literature that melatonin treatment is highly effective in different in vivo and in vitro models of excitotoxicity or ischemia/reperfusion in multiple animal species. Melatonin is safe and non-toxic in humans, and its administration via the oral route or intravenous injection is convenient. While more experimental studies should be conducted to further explore the neuroprotective mechanisms and to document any synergistic or additive protection from combining melatonin with thrombolysis, defibrinogenation or other neuroprotectants, interested clinical scientists should consider planning phase II and III studies to confirm the benefit of melatonin as an acute stroke treatment or a preventive measure for stroke patients.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24646622": "Melatonin, a natural product of the pineal gland, has been shown to protect against ischemic stroke, but the molecular mechanisms underlying its protective function are not fully understood.

The I/R brain injury was induced by the established rat transient middle cerebral artery occlusion model. We found intraperitoneal injection of melatonin can ameliorate rat brain injury as evidenced by multiple morphological and behavioral criteria, such as infarct size, neurological score, serum creatine kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase content, as well as pyknotic-positive cells. Further studies revealed that the beneficial effects of melatonin is through targeting the autophagy pathway by inhibiting expression of beclin-1 and conversion of LC3, as well as activating the PI3K/Akt pro-survival pathway. To further confirm this finding, the autophagy pathway was activated by lentiviral mediated beclin-1 delivery and the PI3K/Akt pathway was inhibited by a pharmacological inhibitor, LY294002.

This approval was supported by an effect on the cerebral amyloid plaque load and evidence of cognitive efficacy to be confirmed in post-marketing trials. Other anti-amyloid antibodies are under investigation in phase III (donanemab, lecanemab, gantenerumab) and have shown preliminary evidence of a cognitive benefit in phase II trials. Although these agents target a small segment of patients with mild cognitive impairment due to AD or mild AD dementia, their advent will change the design of future clinical trials both for anti-amyloid and non-amyloid drugs. These changes will promote the selection of patients in clinical trials by amyloid and tau biomarkers that identify patients with appropriate biology and may follow the treatment response to approved amyloid antibodies. The use of these agents creates the opportunity to test combined drug therapies and to conduct comparative assessments with innovative therapies and newly approved drugs available in clinical practice. Blood-based AD biomarkers should be implemented in research and could facilitate the recruitment into clinical trials.

Anti-amyloid monoclonal antibodies can substantially reverse amyloid plaque pathology and may modify the course of the disease by slowing or stopping its clinical progression. Several molecules targeting amyloid have failed in clinical development due to drug-related factors (e.g., treatment-limiting adverse events, low potency, poor brain penetration), study design/methodological issues (e.g., disease stage, lack of AD pathology confirmation), and other factors. The US Food and Drug Administration's approval of aducanumab, an anti-amyloid monoclonal antibody as the first potential disease-modifying therapy for AD, signaled the value of more than 20 years of drug development, adding to the available therapies the first nominal success since cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine were approved. BODY: Here, we review over 2 decades of gantenerumab development in the context of scientific discoveries in the broader AD field. Key learnings from the field were incorporated into the gantenerumab phase 3 program, including confirmed amyloid positivity as an entry criterion, an enriched clinical trial population to ensure measurable clinical decline, data-driven exposure-response models to inform a safe and efficacious dosing regimen, and the use of several blood-based biomarkers. Subcutaneous formulation for more pragmatic implementation was prioritized as a key feature from the beginning of the gantenerumab development program.\nCONCLUSION: The results from the gantenerumab phase 3 programs are expected by the end of 2022 and will add critical information to the collective knowledge on the search for effective AD treatments.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37017737": "PURPOSE: Pittsburgh Compound-B (11C-PiB) and 18F-florbetapir are amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracers that have been used as endpoints in Alzheimer's disease (AD) clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy of anti-A\u03b2 monoclonal antibodies. However, comparing drug effects between and within trials may become complicated if different A\u03b2 radiotracers were used. To study the consequences of using different A\u03b2 radiotracers to measure A\u03b2 clearance, we performed a head-to-head comparison of 11C-PiB and 18F-florbetapir in a Phase 2/3 clinical trial of anti-A\u03b2 monoclonal antibodies.\nMETHODS: Sixty-six mutation-positive participants enrolled in the gantenerumab and placebo arms of the first Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network Trials Unit clinical trial (DIAN-TU-001) underwent both 11C-PiB and 18F-florbetapir PET imaging at baseline and during at least one follow-up visit. For each PET scan, regional standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs), regional Centiloids, a global cortical SUVR, and a global cortical Centiloid value were calculated. Longitudinal changes in SUVRs and Centiloids were estimated using linear mixed models. Differences in longitudinal change between PET radiotracers and between drug arms were estimated using paired and Welch two sample t-tests, respectively. Simulated clinical trials were conducted to evaluate the consequences of some research sites using 11C-PiB while other sites use 18F-florbetapir for A\u03b2 PET imaging.\nRESULTS: In the placebo arm, the absolute rate of longitudinal change measured by global cortical 11C-PiB SUVRs did not differ from that of global cortical 18F-florbetapir SUVRs. In the gantenerumab arm, global cortical 11C-PiB SUVRs decreased more rapidly than global cortical 18F-florbetapir SUVRs. Drug effects were statistically significant across both A\u03b2 radiotracers. In contrast, the rates of longitudinal change measured in global cortical Centiloids did not differ between A\u03b2 radiotracers in either the placebo or gantenerumab arms, and drug effects remained statistically significant. Regional analyses largely recapitulated these global cortical analyses. Across simulated clinical trials, type I error was higher in trials where both A\u03b2 radiotracers were used versus trials where only one A\u03b2 radiotracer was used. Power was lower in trials where 18F-florbetapir was primarily used versus trials where 11C-PiB was primarily used.\nCONCLUSION: Gantenerumab treatment induces longitudinal changes in A\u03b2 PET, and the absolute rates of these longitudinal changes differ significantly between A\u03b2 radiotracers. These differences were not seen in the placebo arm, suggesting that A\u03b2-clearing treatments may pose unique challenges when attempting to compare longitudinal results across different A\u03b2 radiotracers. Our results suggest converting A\u03b2 PET SUVR measurements to Centiloids (both globally and regionally) can harmonize these differences without losing sensitivity to drug effects. Nonetheless, until consensus is achieved on how to harmonize drug effects across radiotracers, and since using multiple radiotracers in the same trial may increase type I error, multisite studies should consider potential variability due to different radiotracers when interpreting A\u03b2 PET biomarker data and, if feasible, use a single radiotracer for the best results.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01760005.

Specifically, we discussed randomized clinical trials in subjects with Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis bearing pathogenic gene mutations, and glucocerebrosidase-associated Parkinson's disease. Learning potential lessons to improve future therapeutic approaches is the aim of this review. Two long-term, controlled trials on three anti-\u03b2-amyloid monoclonal antibodies (solanezumab, gantenerumab and crenezumab) in subjects carrying Alzheimer's disease-linked mutated genes encoding for amyloid precursor protein or presenilin 1 or presenilin 2 failed to show cognitive or functional benefits. A major trial on tominersen, an antisense oligonucleotide designed to reduce the production of the huntingtin protein in subjects with Huntington's disease, was prematurely interrupted because the drug failed to show higher efficacy than placebo and, at highest doses, led to worsened outcomes. A 28-week trial of tofersen, an antisense oligonucleotide for superoxide dismutase 1 in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with superoxide dismutase 1 gene mutations failed to show significant beneficial effects but the 1-year open label extension of this study indicated better clinical and functional outcomes in the group with early tofersen therapy. A trial of venglustat, a potent and brain-penetrant glucosylceramide synthase inhibitor, in Parkinson's disease subjects with heterozygous glucocerebrosidase gene mutations revealed worsened clinical and cognitive performance of patients on the enzyme inhibitor compared to placebo. We concluded that clinical trials in neurodegenerative diseases with a genetic basis should test monoclonal antibodies, antisense oligonucleotides or gene editing directed against the mutated enzyme or the mutated substrate without dramatically affecting physiological wild-type variants.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36281062": "Despite considerable investment into potential therapeutic approaches for Alzheimer's disease (AD), currently approved treatment options are limited. Predictive modeling using quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) can be used to guide the design of clinical trials in AD. This study developed a QSP model representing amyloid beta (A\u03b2) pathophysiology in AD. The model included mechanisms of A\u03b2 monomer production and aggregation to form insoluble fibrils and plaques; the transport of soluble species between the compartments of brain, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and plasma; and the pharmacokinetics, transport, and binding of monoclonal antibodies to targets in the three compartments. Ordinary differential equations were used to describe these processes quantitatively. The model components were calibrated to data from the literature and internal studies, including quantitative data supporting the underlying AD biology and clinical data from clinical trials for anti-A\u03b2 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) aducanumab, crenezumab, gantenerumab, and solanezumab. The model was developed for an apolipoprotein E (APOE) \u025b4 allele carrier and tested for an APOE \u025b4 noncarrier. Results indicate that the model is consistent with data on clinical A\u03b2 accumulation in untreated individuals and those treated with monoclonal antibodies, capturing increases in A\u03b2 load accurately. This model may be used to investigate additional AD mechanisms and their impact on biomarkers, as well as predict A\u03b2 load at different dose levels for mAbs with known targets and binding affinities. This model may facilitate the design of scientifically enriched and efficient clinical trials by enabling a priori prediction of biomarker dynamics in the brain and CSF.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37823427": "BACKGROUND: Congenital fibrinogen deficiencies (CFD) are a group of rare bleeding disorders (RBD).

From the first clinical description of afibrinogenemia in 1920, many major achievements have contributed to a better understanding of these complex disorders. The finding of causative mutations in all three fibrinogen genes has contributed to reveal the molecular mechanisms involved in biosynthesis of the fibrinogen molecule and to clarify the basic processes of fibrin polymerization and fibrinolysis. The compilation of abundant cases with detailed genetic, biological, and clinical features has enabled the classification of congenital fibrinogen disorders into several types and subtypes. Thus, the recent classification of congenital fibrinogen disorder is based not only on the clottable and antigenic fibrinogen levels but also on the patient's clinical phenotype and genotype. Fibrinogen supplementation is the cornerstone of bleeding management in fibrinogen disorders. Since the discovery of blood fractionation, the method of production of fibrinogen concentrate has been progressively modified to significantly improve purity and safety. Nevertheless, the availability of such products is still limited to a few countries and the optimal threshold of fibrinogen to target is still not established. In this review, we describe the major advances that have characterized 100 years of congenital fibrinogen disorders, focusing on afibrinogenemia and dysfibrinogenemia.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35853369": "Ranging from bleeding to thrombosis, the clinical features of congenital fibrinogen qualitative disorders, including dysfibrinogenemia and hypodysfibrinogenemia, are highly heterogeneous. Although the associations between some specific fibrinogen mutations and the thrombotic phenotypes have been well elucidated, the underlying mechanism between fibrinogen variants and bleeding events remains underestimated. After systematically reviewing the literature of (hypo-)dysfibrinogenemia patients with bleeding phenotypes, we identified several well-characterized bleeding-related fibrinogen variants in those patients. Several possible pathomechanisms are proposed to explain the genotype-phenotype associations: 1, mutations in the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal portion of the A\u03b1 chain hamper fibrinogen fitting into the active site cleft of thrombin and drastically slow the conversion of fibrinogen into monomeric fibrin; 2, mutations adding new N-linked glycosylation sites introduce bulky and negatively charged carbohydrate side chains and undermine the alignment of fibrin monomers during polymerization; 3, mutations generating unpaired cysteine form extra disulfide bonds between the abnormal fibrinogen chains and produce highly branched and fragile fibrin networks; 4, truncation mutations in the fibrinogen \u03b1C regions impair the lateral fibril aggregation, as well as factor XIII crosslinking, endothelial cell and platelet binding. These established relationships between specific variants and the bleeding tendency will help manage (hypo-)dysfibrinogenemia patients to avoid adverse bleeding outcomes.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35821906": "UNLABELLED: Fibrinogen deficiencies are very rare. Qualitative fibrinogen deficiencies (dysfibrinogenaemia and hypodysfibrinogenemia) are functional disorders that can present with both haemorrhagic symptoms and with thrombotic phenomena as unique and paradoxical manifestation. We present the case of a 77-year-old man being investigated for a partially thrombosed abdominal aortic aneurysm as well as an ischaemic stroke 20 years previously. Basic coagulation tests were normal but extended tests revealed a lengthened thrombin time (TT) combined with a significant drop in fibrinogen concentration measured with the Clauss assay and by nephelometry. After secondary fibrinogen deficiencies were ruled out, a heterozygous variant in the FGG gene was detected by next-generation sequencing, and congenital hypodysfibrinogenemia was diagnosed. Acenocumarol was initiated and no new thrombotic or haemorrhagic events had occurred after a year of follow-up. In almost 25% of cases, thrombotic events may be the only clinical manifestation of functional fibrinogen deficiencies. They are a rare cause of thrombophilia, and are probably underdiagnosed due to normal standard coagulation test results as well as a possible absence of haemorrhagic events. Consequently, a TT test (an initial 'rule out' test) should be requested in order to promptly identify these patients. Moreover, discrepancies in derived and Clauss fibrinogen test results should suggest a functional disorder. Finally, new coagulation techniques based on the functional characterization of clot formation, such as ROTEM or thrombin generation assay, could help characterize these entities and suggest new therapeutic approaches.\nLEARNING POINTS: Functional fibrinogen deficiencies can present with thrombotic manifestations only, and are a rare and probably underdiagnosed cause of thrombophilia.Thrombin time is a highly sensitive test to rule out other conditions as aPTT and PT results may be within normal ranges, especially in functional deficiencies.Discrepancies between derived and Clauss fibrinogen findings, fibrinogen protein measurements and the use of new techniques (ROTEM or thrombin generation) are important for correct approach.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35207353": "Congenital fibrinogen disorders are diseases associated with a bleeding tendency; however, there are also reports of thrombotic events. Fibrinogen plays a role in the pathogenesis of thrombosis due to altered plasma concentrations or modifications to fibrinogen's structural properties, which affect clot permeability, resistance to lysis, and its stiffness. Several distinct types of genetic change and pathogenetic mechanism have been described in patients with bleeding and a thrombotic phenotype, including mutations affecting synthesis or processing in three fibrinogen genes. In this paper, we focused on familial hypofibrinogenemia, a rare inherited quantitative fibrinogen disorder characterized by decreased fibrinogen levels with a high phenotypic heterogeneity. To begin, we briefly review the basic information regarding fibrinogen's structure, its function, and the clinical consequences of low fibrinogen levels. Thereafter, we introduce 15 case reports with various gene mutations derived from the fibrinogen mutation database GFHT (French Study Group on Hemostasis and Thrombosis), which are associated with congenital hypofibrinogenemia with both bleeding and thrombosis. Predicting clinical presentations based on genotype data is difficult. Genotype-phenotype correlations would be of help to better understand the pathologic properties of this rare disease and to provide a valuable tool for the identification of patients who are not only at risk of bleeding, but also at risk of a thrombotic event.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25617013": "Thalidomide is resurging in the management of adult rheumatologic skin conditions, especially lupus erythematosus.

NF-\u03baB is retained in the cytoplasm with I\u03baB\u03b1, and is activated by a wide variety of inflammatory stimuli including TNF, IL-1 and endotoxin followed by its translocation to the nucleus.

Thalidomide is currently under investigation for the treatment of a wide variety of diseases, including conditions thought to have an inflammatory or immune basis, malignancies and complications of infection with HIV. Interest in the potential anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory and anti- angiogenic effects of thalidomide has resulted in off-label use of prescription thalidomide. During the first 18 months of spontaneous postmarketing adverse event surveillance for Thalomid, 1210 spontaneous postmarketing adverse event reports were received for patients treated with prescription thalidomide for all therapeutic indications, including off-label use. The most common adverse events spontaneously reported would have been expected on the basis of the current Thalomid labelling/product information. The current labelling/product information reflects what was known about the risks associated with thalidomide therapy in limited patient populations at the time of the approval of Thalomid. With the postmarketing use of thalidomide in populations other than patients with ENL, it becomes increasingly important to identify patient groups that may be particularly susceptible to specific adverse drug effects and to identify conditions under which specific adverse events may be more likely to occur. Oncology patients may represent a patient population with increased susceptibility to thalidomide-associated adverse effects, including thromboembolic events. Consideration of the spontaneous postmarketing safety surveillance data may help to identify and characterise factors associated with increased risk in this and other patient groups. Serious unexpected adverse events reported with sufficient frequency to signal previously undetected product-event associations for which there may potentially be plausible evidence to suggest a causal relationship have included seizures and Stevens-Johnson syndrome. The potential effects of thalidomide on wound healing are also being closely monitored. Premarketing human clinical trials of drug products are inherently limited in their ability to detect adverse events.

In this study, we report the case of a 30-year-old man who presented with upper gastrointestinal bleeding and obstructive symptoms due to a giant Brunner's gland hamartoma in the duodenal bulb. The hamartoma was successfully removed by endoscopic resection. No significant complications were observed.

As well known, the small intestine, including the 4th portion of duodenum, jejunum, and ileum, is relatively inaccessible with routine endoscopy. Thus, the diagnosis of Brunner's gland hamartoma in these area can be delayed up to several months after onset of symptoms.

Most patients are asymptomatic, some may present with gastrointestinal hemorrhage or intestinal obstruction. Symptomatic larger lesions leading to bleeding or obstruction should be excised either endoscopically or surgically. Whether it is safe and effective that removing a BGH measuring about 7\u2009cm by HSP is not known.\nCASE PRESENTATION: Here, we reported a rare case of a proximal duodenum pedunculated mass measuring about 7\u2009cm which was responsible for the patient's severe anemia. we treated it as a pedunculated polyp. After being pretreated the stalk with an endoloop which was placed around the base of the mass to prevent post-polypectomy bleeding (PPB), the pedunculated BGH was removed by HSP completely. The stalk of the mass was negative.

Paediatric data, however, remain extremely scarce.\nMETHODS: We conducted a prospective observational study of children (0-18\u00a0years) receiving APD with cloud-based RPM over two 24-week periods (pre- and post-RPM). Primary outcomes were unplanned hospitalizations and fluid management. Children receiving APD without RPM (non-RPM) were included as control.\nRESULTS: Seven patients (6 females) receiving APD were enrolled in the RPM programme at 11.3\u00a0years (IQR 2.6-17.1). Main indications for RPM included history of fluid overload (n\u2009=\u20093) and non-adherence (n\u2009=\u20092). Ten children were included in the non-RPM group (6 females; 16.9\u00a0years, IQR 12.8-17.6). Four patients (57.1%, 95% CI 22.5-100%) experienced fewer unplanned hospitalizations and 5 patients (71.4%, 95% CI 34.1-100%) had shorter hospital stays during the post-RPM period. The hospitalization rates and length of stay were reduced by 45% and 42%, respectively. The higher hospitalization rates among the RPM group, compared to the non-RPM group, were no longer observed following implementation of RPM. There was a significant increase in ultrafiltration (565.6\u2009\u00b1\u2009248.7 vs. 501.7\u2009\u00b1\u2009286.6\u00a0ml/day, p\u2009=\u20090.03) and reduction in systolic blood pressure (114.1\u2009\u00b1\u200912.6 vs. 119.9\u2009\u00b1\u200911.19\u00a0mmHg, p\u2009=\u20090.02) during the post-RPM period. All patients demonstrated satisfactory adherence. Although quality of life (PedsQL 3.0 ESRD module) was not different pre- and post-RPM, all patients agreed in the questionnaires that the use of RPM improved their quality of life and sense of security.\nCONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, RPM in children receiving APD is associated with fewer and shorter unplanned hospitalizations, improved fluid management and favourable adherence to PD.

We present guidelines for dialysis initiation, modality selection, small solute clearance, and fluid removal in children on PD. A review of the literature and key studies that support these statements are presented.\nMETHODS: An extensive Medline search for all publications on PD in children was performed using predefined search criteria.\nRESULTS: High-quality randomized trials in children are scarce and current clinical practice largely relies on data extrapolated from adult studies or drawn from observational cohort studies in children. The evidence and strength of the recommendation is GRADE-ed, but in the absence of high-quality evidence, the opinion of the authors is provided and must be carefully considered by the treating physician, and adapted to local expertise and individual patient needs as appropriate. We discuss the timing of dialysis initiation, factors to be considered when selecting a dialysis modality, the assessment and management of volume status on PD, achieving optimal small solute clearance, and the importance of preserving residual kidney function. While optimal dialysis must remain the goal for every patient, a careful discussion with fully informed patients and caregivers is important to understand the patient and family's expectations of dialysis and reasonable adjustments to the dialysis program may be considered in accordance with a philosophy of shared decision-making.\nCONCLUSIONS: There continues to be very poor evidence in the field of chronic PD in children and these recommendations can at best serve to guide clinical decision-making.

Hemodialysis (HD) is used less often due to the technical challenges and risk of complications in smaller patients. There are limited data on chronic HD in this patient population.\nMETHODS: This was a retrospective study of children younger than 24\u00a0months on HD and PD in the North American Pediatric Renal Trials and Collaborative Studies (NAPRTCS) registry between January 1992 and December 2018. We compared demographic, clinical, and laboratory data and outcomes, including patient survival and kidney transplantation.\nRESULTS: We identified 1125 infants and toddlers younger than 2\u00a0years of age who initiated KRT from January 1992 to December 2018. Of those, 1011 (89.8%) initiated peritoneal dialysis and 114 (10.2%) initiated hemodialysis. Median (IQR) age at HD onset was 12 (5.6-18.7) months compared to 4.6 (0.8-11.7) months at PD onset (p\u2009<\u20090.001). The primary cause of kidney failure with replacement therapy was congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (56.2% of PD versus 39.5% of HD group). Patients on HD had superior growth and nutrition markers than those on PD. Patient survival was similar between the two groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: While HD may not be the modality of choice for chronic KRT in younger children, 10% of children younger than 24\u00a0months of age receive maintenance HD and the numbers have increased over time.

Amyloid b<sub>1-42</sub> (A\u03b2) has been the main target of experimental therapies, based on evidence of the neurotoxic effects of A\u03b2, and of the potential adverse effects of brain A\u03b2\u00a0burden detected in humans in vivo by positron emission tomography (PET). Progress on passive anti-amyloid immunotherapy research includes identification of antibodies that facilitate microglial activation, catalytical disaggregation, and increased flow of A\u03b2\u00a0from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to plasma, thus decreasing the neurotoxic effects of A\u03b2. Recently completed phase 2 and 3 trials of 3rd generation anti-amyloid immunotherapies are supportive of their clinical efficacy in reducing brain A\u03b2\u00a0burden and preventing cognitive decline. Data from recent trials implicate these agents as the first effective disease-modifying therapies against AD and has led to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recent approval of aducanumab and lecanemab, under an accelerated approval pathway. The clinical effects of these agents are modest, however, and associated with amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA).

At the time of writing, two amyloid-lowering antibodies, aducanumab and lecanemab, have obtained United States Food and Drug Administration accelerated approval, with further agents of this class in the Alzheimer's disease treatment pipeline. Based on limited published clinical trial data to date, regulators, payors and physicians will need to assess their efficacy, clinical effectiveness and safety, as well as cost and accessibility. We propose that attention to three important questions related to treatment efficacy, clinical effectiveness and safety should guide evidence-based consideration of this important class of drugs. These are: (1) Were trial statistical analyses appropriate and did they convincingly support claims of efficacy? (2) Do reported treatment effects outweigh safety concerns and are they generalizable to a representative clinical population of people with Alzheimer's disease? and (3) Do the data convincingly demonstrate disease course modification, suggesting that increasing clinical benefits beyond the duration of the trials are likely? We suggest specific approaches to interpreting trial results for these drugs and highlight important areas of uncertainty where additional data and a cautious interpretation of existing results is warranted. Safe, effective and accessible treatments for Alzheimer's disease are eagerly awaited by millions of patients and their caregivers worldwide. While amyloid-targeting immunotherapies may be promising disease-modifying Alzheimer's disease treatments, rigorous and unbiased assessment of clinical trial data is critical to regulatory decision-making and subsequently determining their provision and utility in routine clinical practice.

To inform this debate, we reviewed the literature on randomized clinical trials conducted with eight such antibodies focusing on clinical efficacy, cerebral amyloid removal, amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIAs) and cerebral volumes to the extent such measurements have been reported. Two antibodies, donanemab and lecanemab, have demonstrated clinical efficacy, but these results remain uncertain. We further argue that the decreased amyloid PET signal in these trials is unlikely to be a one-to-one reflection of amyloid removal, but rather a reflection of increased therapy-related brain damage, as supported by the increased incidence of ARIAs and reported loss of brain volume. Due to these uncertainties of benefit and risk, we recommend that the FDA pauses existing approvals and approval of new antibodies until results of phase 4 studies with these drugs are available to inform on these risk-benefit uncertainties. We recommend that the FDA prioritize FDG PET and detection of ARIAs and accelerated brain volume loss with MRI in all trial patients, and neuropathological examination of all patients who die in these phase 4 trials.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37334596": "After the CLARITY-AD clinical trial results of lecanemab were interpreted as positive, and supporting the amyloid hypothesis, the drug received accelerated Food and Drug Administration approval.

We note potential biases from inclusion, unblinding, dropouts, and other issues. Given substantial adverse effects and subgroup heterogeneity, we conclude that lecanemab's efficacy is not clinically meaningful, consistent with numerous analyses suggesting that amyloid-\u03b2 and its derivatives are not the main causative agents of Alzheimer's disease dementia.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37357276": "Lecanemab (Leqembi\u00ae) is approved in the United States for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) to be initiated in early AD (mild cognitive impairment [MCI] due to AD or mild AD dementia) with confirmed brain amyloid pathology. Appropriate Use Recommendations (AURs) are intended to help guide the introduction of new therapies into real-world clinical practice. Community dwelling patients with AD differ from those participating in clinical trials. Administration of lecanemab at clinical trial sites by individuals experienced with monoclonal antibody therapy also differs from the community clinic-based administration of lecanemab. These AURs use clinical trial data as well as research and care information regarding AD to help clinicians administer lecanemab with optimal safety and opportunity for effectiveness. Safety and efficacy of lecanemab are known only for patients like those participating in the phase 2 and phase 3 lecanemab trials, and these AURs adhere closely to the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the trials. Adverse events may occur with lecanemab including amyloid related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) and infusion reactions. Monitoring guidelines for these events are detailed in this AUR. Most ARIA with lecanemab is asymptomatic, but a few cases are serious or, very rarely, fatal. Microhemorrhages and rare macrohemorrhages may occur in patients receiving lecanemab. Anticoagulation increases the risk of hemorrhage, and the AUR recommends that patients requiring anticoagulants not receive lecanemab until more data regarding this interaction are available. Patients who are apolipoprotein E \u03b54 (APOE4) gene carriers, especially APOE4 homozygotes, are at higher risk for ARIA, and the AUR recommends APOE genotyping to better inform risk discussions with patients who are lecanemab candidates. Clinician and institutional preparedness are mandatory for use of lecanemab, and protocols for management of serious events should be developed and implemented. Communication between clinicians and therapy candidates or those on therapy is a key element of good clinical practice for the use of lecanemab.

The incidence of malaria in the United States has increased since 2011, in conjunction with the increase in worldwide travel. An estimated 2,000 cases of malaria occur annually in the United States. All travelers to malaria-endemic regions should be prescribed prophylaxis. Malaria has a broad range of clinical presentations. Travelers who have symptoms of malaria should seek medical attention as soon as possible. All febrile travelers who have recently returned from a malarious area should be evaluated for malaria. The accurate, timely, and species-specific diagnosis of malaria is essential for successful treatment. Direct microscopy of Giemsa-stained blood smears is the reference standard for laboratory diagnosis. Rapid testing for malaria has emerged as an important adjunctive diagnostic modality. Malaria treatment is determined by individual patient factors and geography.

Over the past decade, the incidence of imported malaria has decreased in all age groups, reflecting the decrease in the incidence of malaria in endemic areas. The rates of severe pediatric cases have increased as in adults, but fatalities are rare. The parasitological diagnosis requires a thick blood smear (or a rapid immunochromatographic test) and a thin blood film. Alternatively, a rapid antigen detection test can be paired with a thin blood film. Thrombocytopenia in children presenting with fever is highly predictive of malaria following travel to a malaria-endemic area and, when detected, malaria should be strongly considered. The first-line treatment of uncomplicated P.\u00a0falciparum\u00a0malaria is now an artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT), either artemether-lumefantrine or artenimol-piperaquine, as recommended by the World Health Organization in endemic areas. Uncomplicated presentations of\u00a0non-falciparum\u00a0malaria should be treated either with chloroquine or ACT. The first-line treatment of severe malaria is now intravenous artesunate which is more effective than quinine in endemic areas.
