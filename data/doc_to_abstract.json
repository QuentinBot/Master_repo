A previous trial of concizumab (explorer4) established proof of concept in patients with hemophilia A or B with inhibitors.\nMETHODS: We conducted the explorer7 trial to assess the safety and efficacy of concizumab in patients with hemophilia A or B with inhibitors. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:2 ratio to receive no prophylaxis for at least 24 weeks (group 1) or concizumab prophylaxis for at least 32 weeks (group 2) or were nonrandomly assigned to receive concizumab prophylaxis for at least 24 weeks (groups 3 and 4). After a treatment pause due to nonfatal thromboembolic events in three patients receiving concizumab, including one from the explorer7 trial, concizumab therapy was restarted with a loading dose of 1.0 mg per kilogram of body weight, followed by 0.2 mg per kilogram daily (potentially adjusted on the basis of concizumab plasma concentration as measured at week 4). The primary end-point analysis compared treated spontaneous and traumatic bleeding episodes in group 1 and group 2.

SUMMARY: Background Concizumab is a humanized mAb targeting tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), leading to enhanced thrombin generation (TG) potential. explorer\u21223 (NCT02490787) was a phase 1b, double-blind, multiple-dose escalation trial of subcutaneous concizumab in people with severe hemophilia A without inhibitors. Objectives The primary objective was to evaluate safety. Assessments of pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and subcutaneous concizumab immunogenicity were secondary objectives. Patients/Methods Adverse events (AEs), clinical assessments and bleeding episodes were recorded. Plasma concizumab levels and unbound TFPI levels were measured with ELISAs; residual TFPI activity was measured with a chromogenic assay. Standardized assays were used to assess TG, D-dimer and prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 (F<sub>1 + 2</sub> ) levels. explorer\u21223 was completed after investigation of three dose cohorts (0.25, 0.5 and 0.8 mg kg-1 , once every 4 days) had been completed. Twenty-four patients received 12 doses of concizumab or placebo in a 3 : 1 randomization over a 42-day period. Results No serious AEs and no anti-drug antibodies were observed. Fifty-four mild and two moderate AEs were observed in 19 patients. Concizumab exposure increased with dose in a non-linear manner, confirming target-mediated drug disposition. D-dimer and F<sub>1 + 2</sub> levels were increased mostly in the highest dose cohort, in line with previous observations. The level of unbound TFPI decreased in a dose-dependent manner, and was accompanied by a residual TFPI activity decrease and an increase in peak TG. Although the trial was not powered to evaluate efficacy, a trend towards lower bleeding rates was observed in patients in the highest dose cohort.

However, the age-specific cumulative risk (penetrance) of these cancers is still poorly defined for PMS2-associated Lynch syndrome. Using a large data set from a worldwide collaboration, our aim was to determine accurate penetrance measures of cancers for carriers of heterozygous pathogenic PMS2 variants.\nMETHODS: A modified segregation analysis was conducted that incorporated both genotyped and nongenotyped relatives, with conditioning for ascertainment to estimates corrected for bias. Hazard ratios (HRs) and corresponding 95% CIs were estimated for each cancer site for mutation carriers compared with the general population, followed by estimation of penetrance.\nRESULTS: In total, 284 families consisting of 4,878 first- and second-degree family members were included in the analysis. PMS2 mutation carriers were at increased risk for colorectal cancer (cumulative risk to age 80 years of 13% [95% CI, 7.9% to 22%] for males and 12% [95% CI, 6.7% to 21%] for females) and endometrial cancer (13% [95% CI, 7.0%-24%]), compared with the general population (6.6%, 4.7%, and 2.4%, respectively). There was no clear evidence of an increased risk of ovarian, gastric, hepatobiliary, bladder, renal, brain, breast, prostate, or small bowel cancer.\nCONCLUSION: Heterozygous PMS2 mutation carriers were at small increased risk for colorectal and endometrial cancer but not for any other Lynch syndrome-associated cancer. This finding justifies that PMS2-specific screening protocols could be restricted to colonoscopies. The role of risk-reducing hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy for PMS2 mutation carriers needs further discussion.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25856668": "Germ-line mutations in MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 have been shown to cause Lynch syndrome. The penetrance of the cancer and tumor spectrum has been repeatedly studied, and multiple professional societies have proposed clinical management guidelines for affected individuals. Several studies have demonstrated a reduced penetrance for monoallelic carriers of PMS2 mutations compared with the other mismatch repair (MMR) genes, but clinical management guidelines have largely proposed the same screening recommendations for all MMR gene carriers. The authors considered whether enough evidence existed to propose new screening guidelines specific to PMS2 mutation carriers with regard to age at onset and frequency of colonic screening. Published reports of PMS2 germ-line mutations were combined with unpublished cases from the authors' research registries and clinical practices, and a discussion of potential modification of cancer screening guidelines was pursued. A total of 234 monoallelic PMS2 mutation carriers from 170 families were included. Approximately 8% of those with colorectal cancer (CRC) were diagnosed before age 30, and each of these tumors presented on the left side of the colon. As it is currently unknown what causes the early onset of CRC in some families with monoallelic PMS2 germline mutations, the authors recommend against reducing cancer surveillance guidelines in families found having monoallelic PMS2 mutations in spite of the reduced penetrance.Genet Med 18 1, 13-19.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15256438": "The MutLalpha heterodimer formed by mismatch repair (MMR) proteins MLH1 and PMS2 is a major component of the MMR complex, yet mutations in the PMS2 gene are rare in the etiology of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer. Evidence from five published cases suggested that contrary to the Knudson principle, PMS2 mutations cause hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer or Turcot syndrome only when they are biallelic in the germline or abnormally expressed. As candidates for PMS2 mutations, we selected seven patients whose colon tumors stained negative for PMS2 and positive for MLH1 by immunohistochemistry. After conversion to haploidy, truncating germline mutations of PMS2 were found in two patients (2192delTAACT and deletion of exon 8). These mutations abrogated PMS2 protein in germline cells by Western analysis. In two additional patients, PMS2 protein from one allele also was abrogated. Novel or previously described missense variants of PMS2 were detected, but their pathogenicity is undetermined. We detected and characterized a new transcript, PMS2CL, showing 98% sequence identity with exons 9 and 11-15 of PMS2 and emanating from a locus close to PMS2 in chromosome 7p. Its predicted protein product was not detected. Thus, in addition to several previously described PMS2-related genes resembling the 5' end of PMS2, at least one related gene resembles the 3' end of PMS2. In conclusion, both detectable and presently undefined germline mutations are deleterious and produce susceptibility to cancer by the two-hit mechanism. Paralogous genes interfere with mutation detection, resulting in underdiagnosis of PMS2 mutations.

Recently, it was shown that germline mutations in another mismatch repair gene, PMS2, play a far more important role in Lynch syndrome than initially thought. To explore this further, we determined the prevalence of pathogenic germline PMS2 mutations in a series of Lynch syndrome-suspected patients. Ninety-seven patients who had early-onset microsatellite instable colorectal or endometrial cancer, or multiple Lynch syndrome-associated tumors and/or were from an Amsterdam Criteria II-positive family were selected for this study. These patients carried no pathogenic germline mutation in MLH1, MSH2, or MSH6. When available, tumors were investigated for immunohistochemical staining (IHC) for PMS2. PMS2 was screened in all patients by exon-by-exon sequencing. We identified four patients with a pathogenic PMS2 mutation (4%) among the 97 patients we selected. IHC of PMS2 was informative in one of the mutation carriers, and in this case, the tumor showed loss of PMS2 expression.

Here, we determined PMS2 mutation detection yield and mutation spectrum in a nationwide cohort of 396 probands. Furthermore, we studied concordance between tumor IHC/MSI (immunohistochemistry/microsatellite instability) profile and mutation carrier state. Overall, we found 52 different pathogenic PMS2 variants explaining 121 Lynch syndrome and nine CMMRD patients. In vitro mismatch repair assays suggested pathogenicity for three missense variants. Ninety-one PMS2 mutation carriers (70%) showed isolated loss of PMS2 in their tumors, for 31 (24%) no or inconclusive IHC was available, and eight carriers (6%) showed discordant IHC (presence of PMS2 or loss of both MLH1 and PMS2). Ten cases with isolated PMS2 loss (10%; 10/97) harbored MLH1 mutations.

The aim of this observational study was to evaluate the effect of nocturnal respiratory-related indices based on nocturnal respiratory polygraphy on clinical outcomes (including mortality and non-fatal events) in patients with ischemic stroke.\nMETHODS: A total of 328 consecutive patients (181 (55%) males, mean age 65.8 \u00b1 11.2 years old) with confirmed ischemic stroke admitted to a stroke unit within 24 h after stroke onset were included in the analysis. All patients underwent standard diagnostic and treatment procedures, and sleep polygraphy was performed within the clinical routine in the first 72 h after admission. The long-term outcomes were assessed by cumulative endpoint (death of any cause, new non-fatal myocardial infarction, new non-fatal stroke/transient ischemic attack, emergency revascularization, emergency hospitalization due to the worsening of cardiovascular disease). A Cox-regression analysis was applied to evaluate the effects of nocturnal respiratory indices on survival.\nRESULTS: The mean follow-up period comprised 12 months (maximal-48 months). Patients with unfavourable outcomes demonstrated a higher obstructive apnea-hypopnea index, a higher hypoxemia burden assessed as a percent of the time with SpO<sub>2</sub> &lt; 90%, a higher average desaturation drop, and a higher respiratory rate at night.

Thirty-two studies were identified, including 22 observational studies and 10 randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Identified studies included the following as predictors of post-stroke recurrent events: obstructive sleep apnea (OSA, n\u00a0=\u00a015 studies), treatment of OSA with positive airway pressure (PAP, n\u00a0=\u00a013 studies), sleep quality and/or insomnia (n\u00a0=\u00a03 studies), sleep duration (n\u00a0=\u00a01 study), polysomnographic sleep/sleep architecture metrics (n\u00a0=\u00a01 study), and restless legs syndrome (n\u00a0=\u00a01 study). A positive relationship of OSA and/or OSA severity with recurrent events/mortality was seen. Findings on PAP treatment for OSA were mixed. Positive findings indicating a benefit of PAP for post-stroke risk came largely from observational studies (pooled RR [95% CI] for association between PAP and recurrent cardiovascular event: 0.37 [0.17-0.79], I2\u00a0=\u00a00%).

Observational studies have shown an increased risk of ischemic stroke in patients with untreated OSA when compared with patients treated with CPAP; however, results are not statistically significant. RCTs and meta-analyses have shown no significant ischemic stroke risk reduction in CPAP treated patients with OSA. Several studies have shown improved outcomes in post-stroke patients with OSA treated with CPAP; however, few data is available for subsequent ischemic stroke risk reduction. Further research is needed for surgical treatment of OSA and assessment of ischemic stroke risk. OSA is associated with increased risk of ischemic stroke, and OSA should be treated with the appropriate therapy.

One reason might be that widely used clinical criteria for detection of OSA in the general community are not applicable in patients with stroke. We hypothesized that patients with stroke report less sleepiness and are less obese than subjects from a community sample with the same severity of OSA.\nMETHODS: We performed polysomnography in 96 consecutive patients with stroke admitted to a stroke rehabilitation unit and in a community sample of 1093 subjects without a history of stroke. We compared the degrees of subjective sleepiness assessed by the Epworth Sleepiness Scale and body mass index between the 2 samples according to OSA categories assessed by the frequency of apneas and hypopneas per hour of sleep (<5, no OSA; 5 to <15 mild OSA; and >or=15, moderate to severe OSA).\nRESULTS: Compared with the community sample, patients with stroke with OSA had significantly lower Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores and body mass index for mild OSA (Epworth Sleepiness Scale 9.3+/-0.3 versus 5.6+/-0.5, P<0.001 and body mass index 33.1+/-0.5 versus 28.5+/-1.1, P<0.048) and for moderate to severe OSA (Epworth Sleepiness Scale 9.7+/-0.4 versus 7.1+/-0.9, P=0.043 and body mass index 36.4+/-0.8 versus 27.2+/-0.8 kg/m(2), P<0.025).\nCONCLUSIONS: For a given severity of OSA, patients with stroke had less daytime sleepiness and lower body mass index than subjects without stroke. These factors may make the diagnosis of OSA elusive in the poststroke period and preclude many such patients from the potential benefits of OSA therapy.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18927265": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) increases the risk of stroke independent of known vascular and metabolic risk factors. Although patients with OSA have higher prevalence of hypertension and evidence of hypercoagulability, the mechanism of this increased risk is unknown. Obstructive apnea events are associated with surges in blood pressure, hypercapnia, and fluctuations in cerebral blood flow. These perturbations can adversely affect the cerebral circulation. We hypothesized that patients with OSA have impaired cerebral autoregulation, which may contribute to the increased risk of cerebral ischemia and stroke. We examined cerebral autoregulation in patients with and without OSA by measuring cerebral artery blood flow velocity (CBFV) by using transcranial Doppler ultrasound and arterial blood pressure using finger pulse photoplethysmography during orthostatic hypotension and recovery as well as during 5% CO(2) inhalation. Cerebral vascular conductance and reactivity were determined. Forty-eight subjects, 26 controls (age 41.0+/-2.3 yr) and 22 OSA (age 46.8+/-2.3 yr) free of cerebrovascular and active coronary artery disease participated in this study. OSA patients had a mean apnea-hypopnea index of 78.4+/-7.1 vs. 1.8+/-0.3 events/h in controls. The oxygen saturation during sleep was significantly lower in the OSA group (78+/-2%) vs. 91+/-1% in controls. The dynamic vascular analysis showed mean CBFV was significantly lower in OSA patients compared with controls (48+/-3 vs. 55+/-2 cm/s; P <0.05, respectively). The OSA group had a lower rate of recovery of cerebrovascular conductance for a given drop in blood pressure compared with controls (0.06+/-0.02 vs. 0.20+/-0.06 cm.s(-2).mmHg(-1); P <0.05). There was no difference in cerebrovascular vasodilatation in response to CO(2). The findings showed that patients with OSA have decreased CBFV at baseline and delayed cerebrovascular compensatory response to changes in blood pressure but not to CO(2).

This abnormality can be identified early in gestation and the damage can be progressive over the course of pregnancy. Advances in fetal treatment have made minimally invasive prenatal surgery a realistic consideration for spina bifida in order to improve the outcome for children affected this condition.\nEVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Prenatal surgery for spina bifida via open fetal surgery with hysterotomy decreases the rate of ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement and improves motor function compared to standard postnatal surgery. Maternal risks of open fetal surgery are primarily related to complications of the hysterotomy including thinning or rupture that begins in the index pregnancy but persists for every future pregnancy. Minimizing maternal risks is the largest impetus to explore and optimize a minimally invasive fetoscopic alternative. Techniques vary from using a complete percutaneous approach to open fetoscopy, which requires laparotomy but is minimally invasive to the uterus. This allows vaginal delivery at term and no scar complications are reported thus far. Fetal short-term neurosurgical outcomes compare favorably with improvement in hindbrain herniation >70% and decreased need for treatment for hydrocephalus between 40-45% after prenatal surgery performed either fetoscopically or through open fetal surgery.\nEVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Maternal obstetric outcomes are superior for fetoscopic spina bifida repair compared to open fetal surgery and avoids the ongoing risk in future pregnancy. Neonatal and infant benefits appear equivalent. The open fetoscopic approach minimizes the risk of ruptured membranes and subsequent preterm delivery as opposed to a completely percutaneous procedure. International collaboration is ongoing to share experience and assess long term treatment effects.\nCONCLUSIONS: Continued refinement of a minimally invasive strategy for prenatal treatment of spina bifida is necessary to maximize benefits to the child and further minimize maternal risks and preterm birth.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36964773": "Spina bifida is a serious birth defect affecting the central nervous system, characterized by incomplete closure of the neural tube. Ethiopia has a very high prevalence of spina bifida, affecting about 40 cases per 10,000 births.

All women underwent two prenatal systematic ultrasound evaluations, approximately 4\u2009weeks apart, with the second one being performed less than 1\u2009week before surgery, and one postnatal evaluation via physical examination within 2\u2009months of birth. Motor-function classification was from spinal level T12 to S1, according to key muscle function. Each leg was analyzed separately; in case of discrepancy between the two legs, the worst motor-function level was considered for analysis. Motor-function-level evaluations were compared with each other and with the anatomical level as observed on ultrasound. Independent predictors of a postnatal reduction in motor-function level were assessed using a logistic regression model.\nRESULTS: Prenatal motor-function level was assessed at a median gestational age of 22.5 (interquartile range (IQR), 20.7-24.3) and 26.7 (IQR, 25.4-27.3) weeks, with a median interval of 4.0 (IQR, 2.4-6.0)\u2009weeks. The median gestational age at surgery was 27.0 (IQR, 25.9-27.6)\u2009weeks and the postnatal examination was at median age of 0.8 (IQR, 0.3-5.4)\u2009months. There was no significant difference in motor-function level between the two prenatal evaluations (P\u2009=\u20090.861). We therefore decided to use the second prenatal evaluation for comparison with postnatal motor function and anatomical level. Overall, prenatal and postnatal motor function evaluations were significantly different from the anatomical level (preoperative assessment, P\u2009=\u20090.0015; postnatal assessment, P\u2009=\u20090.0333). Comparing prenatal with postnatal motor-function level, we found that 87.2% of babies had similar or improved motor function compared with that prior to prenatal surgery. On logistic regression analysis, lower anatomical level of defect and greater difference between anatomical level and prenatal motor-function level were identified as independent predictors of postnatal motor function (odds ratio, 0.237 (95%\u2009CI, 0.095-0.588) (P\u2009=\u20090.002) and 3.44 (95%\u2009CI, 1.738-6.813) (P\u2009<\u20090.001), respectively).\nCONCLUSIONS: During a 4-week interval between first ultrasound evaluation and late fetal surgical repair of open spina bifida, motor function does not change significantly, suggesting that late repair, \u2265\u200926\u2009weeks, does not impact negatively on motor-function outcome.

Spina bifida should be found in utero for the immediate operation after birth. At present, most of these major anomalies of CNS can be successfully screened or diagnosed by using ultrasonography. Brain anomalies such as hydrocephalus, Dandy-Walker anomaly and holoprosencephaly show characteristic dilatation of ventricles, which can be easily found in the routine screening ultrasonography from the beginning of the second trimester of gestation. Ultrasonographic detection of neural tube defects such as anencephaly and spina bifida is not difficult in utero. Thus it is possible to diagnose the most of CNS anomalies by using prenatal ultrasound in the early stage of gestation now. Recent advances of ultrasonography, particularly the development of transvaginal technique have contributed to the earlier diagnosis of CNS anomaly even in the first trimester of gestation.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33805441": "Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is a late-onset intractable myopathy, characterized by slowly progressive ptosis, dysphagia, and proximal limb weakness. It is caused by the abnormal expansion of the alanine-encoding (GCN)n trinucleotide repeat in the exon 1 of the polyadenosine (poly[A]) binding protein nuclear 1 gene (11-18 repeats in OPMD instead of the normal 10 repeats). As the disease progresses, the patients gradually develop a feeling of suffocation, regurgitation of food, and aspiration pneumonia, although the initial symptoms and the progression patterns vary among the patients. Autologous myoblast transplantation may provide therapeutic benefits by reducing swallowing problems in these patients. Therefore, it is important to assemble information on such patients for the introduction of effective treatments in nonendemic areas. Herein, we present a concise review of recent progress in clinical and pathological studies of OPMD and introduce an idea for setting up a nation-wide OPMD disease registry in Japan. Since it is important to understand patients' unmet medical needs, realize therapeutically targetable symptoms, and identify indices of therapeutic efficacy, our attempt to establish a unique patient registry of OPMD will be a helpful tool to address these urgent issues.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35942670": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Oculopharyngodistal myopathy (OPDM) is a rare adolescent or adult-onset neuromuscular disease that is characterized by progressive ocular, facial, pharyngeal and distal limb muscle weakness. The rimmed vacuoles and intranuclear inclusions in myofibers constitute the pathological hallmark of OPDM. In this review, the latest findings related to the genetic, molecular and clinical features of OPDM, as well as the diagnosis and management are summarized.\nRECENT FINDINGS: Four gene mutations, CGG repeats in the 5'-untranslated region of LRP12 , GIPC1 , NOTCH2NLC and RILPL1 have been reported to be disease-causing genes in OPDM, namely OPDM1, OPDM2, OPDM3 and OPDM4, accordingly. So far, limited studies have suggested that CGG repeat expansion within the pathogenic range may play a key role in the pathogenesis of OPDM with the gain-of-function mechanism at the RNA and/or protein level, while repeat expansion over a threshold limit may cause hypermethylation, leading to the transcriptional silencing of the CGG repeats in the expanded allele, which results in the existence of mild phenotype or asymptomatic carriers.\nSUMMARY: Novel gene mutations, possible molecular mechanisms and the clinical features related to different causative genes are discussed in this review. More studies on the exact pathogenic mechanism are needed.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14526187": "Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is a muscle disease of late onset associated with progressive ptosis of the eyelids, dysphagia, and unique tubulofilamentous intranuclear inclusions (INIs). OPMD is usually transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait (OMIM 164300). A rarer allelic autosomal recessive form has also been observed (OMIM 257950). Both forms are caused by short (GCG)8-13 expansions in the polyadenylate-binding protein nuclear 1 gene (PABPN1) located on chromosome 14q11.1. The mutations cause the lengthening of an N-terminal polyalanine domain. Both slippage and unequal recombination have been proposed as the mutation mechanisms. The size of the mutation has not yet been conclusively shown to inversely correlate with the severity of the phenotype. Mutated PABPN1 proteins have been shown to be constituents of the INIs. The INIs also contain ubiquitin, proteasome subunits, HSP 40, HSP 70, SKIP, and abundant poly(A)-mRNA. The exact mechanism responsible for polyalanine toxicity in OPMD is unknown. Various intranuclear inclusion dependent and independent mechanisms have been proposed based on the major known function of PABPN1 in polyadenylation of mRNA and its shuttling from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. OPMD is one of the few triplet-repeat diseases for which the function of the mutated gene is known. Because of the increasing number of diseases caused by polyalanine expansions and the pathological overlap with CAG/polyglutamine diseases, what pathological insight is gained by the study of OPMD could lead to a better understanding of a much larger group of developmental and degenerative diseases.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29725764": "Dysphagia is one of the primary symptoms experienced by individuals with Oculopharyngeal Muscular Dystrophy (OPMD). However, we lack understanding of the discrete changes in swallowing physiology that are seen in OPMD, and the resulting relationship to impairments of swallowing safety and efficiency. This study sought to describe the pathophysiology of dysphagia in a small sample of patients with OPMD using a videofluoroscopy examination (VFSS) involving 3\u2009\u00d7\u20095\u00a0mL boluses of thin\u00a0liquid barium (22% w/v). The aim of this study is to extend what is known about the pathophysiology of dysphagia in OPMD, by quantifying changes in swallow timing, kinematics, safety, and efficiency, measured from VFSS. This study is a secondary analysis of baseline VFSS collected from 11 adults (4 male), aged 48-62 (mean 57) enrolled in an industry-sponsored phase 2 therapeutic drug trial. Blinded raters scored the VFSS recordings for safety [Penetration-Aspiration Scale (PAS)], efficiency [Normalized Residue Ratio Scale (NRRS)], timing [Pharyngeal Transit Time (PTT), Swallow Reaction Time (SRT), Laryngeal Vestibule Closure Reaction Time (LVCrt), Upper Esophageal Sphincter Opening Duration (UESD)], and kinematics (hyoid movement, pharyngeal constriction, UES opening width). Impairment thresholds from existing literature were defined to characterize swallowing physiology and function. Further, Fisher's Exact tests and Pearson's correlations were used to conduct a preliminary exploration of associations between swallowing physiology (e.g., kinematics, timing) and function (i.e., safety, efficiency). Compared to published norms, we identified significant differences in the degree of maximum pharyngeal constriction, hyoid movement distance and speed, as well as degree and timeliness of airway closure. Unsafe swallowing (PAS\u2009\u2265\u20093) was seen in only 3/11 patients. By contrast, clinically significant residue (i.e., NRRS scores\u2009\u2265\u20090.09 vallecular;\u2009\u2265\u20090.2 pyriform) was seen in 7/11 patients. Fisher's Exact tests revealed associations between prolonged SRT, PTT, and unsafe swallowing. Weak associations were also identified between post-swallow residue and poor pharyngeal constriction during the swallow. Detailed analysis of swallowing physiology in this series of adults with OPMD aligns with impaired muscular function (e.g., reduced pharyngeal constriction, incomplete laryngeal vestibule closure) associated with the disease, and primary functional challenges with swallow efficiency. Further work is needed to explore a greater range of food and liquid textures, and to identify additional physiological mechanisms underlying swallowing impairment in OPMD.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32842713": "Small non-coding microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in the regulation of mRNA stability. Their features, including high stability and secretion to biofluids, make them attractive as potential biomarkers for diverse pathologies. This is the first study reporting miRNA as potential biomarkers for oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD), an adult-onset myopathy. We hypothesized that miRNA that is differentially expressed in affected muscles from OPMD patients is secreted to biofluids and those miRNAs could be used as biomarkers for OPMD. We first identified candidate miRNAs from OPMD-affected muscles and from muscles from an OPMD mouse model using RNA sequencing. We then compared the OPMD-deregulated miRNAs to the literature and, subsequently, we selected a few candidates for expression studies in serum and saliva biofluids using qRT-PCR. We identified 126 miRNAs OPMD-deregulated in human muscles, but 36 deregulated miRNAs in mice only (pFDR &lt; 0.05). Only 15 OPMD-deregulated miRNAs overlapped between the in humans and mouse studies. The majority of the OPMD-deregulated miRNAs showed opposite deregulation direction compared with known muscular dystrophies miRNAs (myoMirs), which are associated. In contrast, similar dysregulation direction was found for 13 miRNAs that are common between OPMD and aging muscles. A significant age-association (p &lt; 0.05) was found for 17 OPMD-deregulated miRNAs (13.4%), whereas in controls, only six miRNAs (1.4%) showed a significant age-association, suggesting that miRNA expression in OPMD is highly age-associated. miRNA expression in biofluids revealed that OPMD-associated deregulation in saliva was similar to that in muscles, but not in serum. The same as in muscle, miRNA expression levels in saliva were also found to be associated with age (p &lt; 0.05). Moreover, the majority of OPMD-miRNAs were found to be associated with dysphagia as an initial symptom. We suggest that levels of specific miRNAs in saliva can mark muscle degeneration in general and dysphagia in OPMD.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37043653": "BACKGROUND: Erythropoietic protoporphyria and X-linked protoporphyria are inborn errors of heme biosynthesis that cause elevated circulating levels of metal-free protoporphyrin and phototoxicity. Both disorders are characterized by excruciating phototoxic attacks after exposure to visible light. Dersimelagon is a new, orally administered, selective melanocortin 1 receptor agonist that increases levels of skin eumelanin.\nMETHODS: We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial to investigate the efficacy and safety of dersimelagon with respect to the time to onset and the severity of symptoms associated with sunlight exposure in patients with erythropoietic protoporphyria or X-linked protoporphyria. Patients 18 to 75 years of age were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive placebo or dersimelagon at a dose of 100 or 300 mg once daily for 16 weeks. The primary end point was the change from baseline to week 16 in the time to the first prodromal symptom associated with sunlight exposure. Patients recorded daily sunlight exposure and symptom data in an electronic diary. Quality of life and safety were also assessed.\nRESULTS: Of the 102 patients (93 with erythropoietic protoporphyria and 9 with X-linked protoporphyria) who underwent randomization, 90% completed the treatment period. The mean daily time to the first prodromal symptom associated with sunlight exposure increased significantly with dersimelagon: the least-squares mean difference from placebo in the change from baseline to week 16 was 53.8 minutes in the 100-mg dersimelagon group (P\u2009=\u20090.008) and 62.5 minutes in the 300-mg dersimelagon group (P\u2009=\u20090.003). The results also suggest that quality of life improved in patients receiving dersimelagon as compared with placebo. The most common adverse events that occurred or worsened during treatment were nausea, freckles, headache, and skin hyperpigmentation.\nCONCLUSIONS: At both doses evaluated, dersimelagon significantly increased the duration of symptom-free sunlight exposure in patients with erythropoietic protoporphyria or X-linked protoporphyria.

Microarray-based gene expression analysis and serum protein profiling were performed in the BLM-induced SSc models. The effect of MT-7117 on transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2)-induced activation of human dermal fibroblasts was evaluated in vitro. Immunohistochemical analyses of MC1R expression in the skin of SSc patients were performed.\nRESULTS: Prophylactic treatment with MT-7117 (\u2265 0.3 mg/kg/day p.o.) significantly inhibited skin fibrosis and lung inflammation, and therapeutic treatment with MT-7117 (\u2265 3 mg/kg/day p.o.) significantly suppressed the development of skin fibrosis in the BLM-induced SSc models. Gene array analysis demonstrated that MT-7117 exerts an anti-inflammatory effect via suppression of the activation of inflammatory cells and inflammation-related signals; additionally, vascular dysfunction was extracted as the pathology targeted by MT-7117. Serum protein profiling revealed that multiple SSc-related biomarkers including P-selectin, osteoprotegerin, cystatin C, growth and differentiation factor-15, and S100A9 were suppressed by MT-7117. MT-7117 inhibited the activation of human dermal fibroblasts by suppressing TGF-\u03b2-induced ACTA2 (encoding \u03b1-smooth muscle actin) mRNA elevation.

Similar trends exist for colorectal adenoma, although the risk appears lower. Visceral fat, or abdominal obesity, seems to be of greater concern than subcutaneous fat obesity, and any 1 kg/m(2) increase in BMI confers additional risk (HR 1.03). Obesity might be associated with worse cancer outcomes, such as recurrence of the primary cancer or mortality. Several factors, including reduced sensitivity to antiangiogenic-therapeutic regimens, might explain these differences. Except for wound infection, obesity has no significant impact on surgical procedures. The underlying mechanisms linking obesity to CRC are still a matter of debate, but metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance and modifications in levels of adipocytokines seem to be of great importance.

However, both psilocybin and MDMA can increase blood pressure and heart rate, which could be a concern if used in older adults with cardiovascular disease. Very few older adults or patients with serious comorbidities have been included in clinical trials of psychedelics to date, raising the question of how generalizable study results are for the patients that most geropsychiatrists will be treating. Research on the neurophysiologic and mechanistic effects of psychedelics in older adults could also provide insights into the aging brain that could have clinical applications in the future. Given the potential of psychedelic compounds to benefit older adults, more research is needed to establish safety and efficacy among older adults, particularly those with multi-morbidity.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12691208": "The FDA and the Spanish Ministry of Health have concluded that the risk/benefit ratio is favorable under certain circumstances for clinical studies investigating MDMA-assisted psychotherapy. Both agencies have approved pilot studies in chronic posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) patients who have failed to obtain relief from at least one course of conventional treatment. These studies, the only ones in the world into the therapeutic use of MDMA, are being funded by a nonprofit research and educational organization, the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS, www.maps.org). A rationale is offered explaining why MAPS chose to focus its limited resources on MDMA, and also on PTSD patients. A Clinical Plan is elaborated for the conduct of the \"adequate and well-controlled\" trials necessary to evaluate the safety and efficacy of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for PTSD, with the studies estimated to cost about 5 million dollars and to take about five years. The Clinical Plan has been developed, in part, through analysis of the studies conducted by Pfizer in its successful effort to have Zoloft approved by the FDA for use with PTSD patients, and through review of transcripts of the FDA's Psychopharmacologic Drugs Advisory Committee meeting that recommended approval of Zoloft for PTSD.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26579955": "Prior to 1985, \u00b13,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) was readily used as a psychotherapeutic adjunct. As MDMA became popular in treating various psychiatric illnesses by mental health professionals, the public started to abuse the MDMA-containing recreational drug \"ecstasy.\" This alarmed the DEA, which led to emergency scheduling of MDMA as a Schedule I drug. Due to its scheduling in 1985, human research and clinical use has been limited. The majority of research on MDMA has been focused on the drug's potential harmful effects rather than its possible therapeutic effects. The limitations on retrospective human studies and preclinical animal models of MDMA neurotoxicity are examined in this analysis. New research has shown that MDMA, used as a catalyst in psychotherapy, is effective in treating posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). This review also examines the psychopharmacological basis for the efficacy of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy. Specifically, the brain regions involved with both PTSD and those activated by MDMA (i.e., amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex, and hippocampus) are examined. Also, the possible neurochemical mechanisms involved in MDMA's efficacy in treating PTSD are reviewed.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37367190": "Bats are well-known to be natural reservoirs of various zoonotic coronaviruses, which have caused outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2002 and 2019, respectively. In late 2020, two new Sarbecoviruses were found in Russia, isolated in Rhinolophus bats, i.e., Khosta-1 in R. ferrumequinum and Khosta-2 in R. hipposideros. The potential danger associated with these new species of Sarbecovirus is that Khosta-2 has been found to interact with the same entry receptor as SARS-CoV-2. Our multidisciplinary approach in this study demonstrates that Khosta-1 and -2 currently appear to be not dangerous with low risk of spillover, as confirmed by prevalence data and by phylogenomic reconstruction. In addition, the interaction between Khosta-1 and -2 with ACE2 appears weak, and furin cleavage sites are absent. While the possibility of a spillover event cannot be entirely excluded, it is currently highly unlikely. This research further emphasizes the importance of assessing the zoonotic potential of widely distributed batborne CoV in order to monitor changes in genomic composition of viruses and prevent spillover events (if any).", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37672628": "Background: Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is a mosquito-borne zoonotic flavivirus and the leading cause of pediatric encephalitis in the Asian Pacific region. The transmission cycle primarily involves Culex spp. mosquitoes and Ardeid birds, with domestic pigs (Sus scrofa domestica) being the source of infectious viruses for the spillover of JEV from the natural endemic transmission cycle into the human population. Although many studies have concluded that domestic pigs play an important role in the transmission cycle of JEV, and infection of humans, the role of feral pigs in the transmission of JEV remains unclear. Since domestic and feral pigs are the same species, and because feral pig populations in the United States are increasing and expanding geographically, the current study aimed to test the hypothesis that if JEV were introduced into the United States, feral pigs might play a role in the transmission cycle. Materials and Methods: Sinclair miniature pigs, that exhibit the feral phenotype, were intradermally inoculated with JEV genotype Ib. These pigs were derived from crossing miniature domestic pig with four strains of feral pigs and were used since obtaining feral swine was not possible. Results: The Sinclair miniature pigs became viremic and displayed pathological outcomes similar to those observed in domestic swine. Conclusion: Based on these findings, we conclude that in the event of JEV being introduced into the United States, feral pig populations could contribute to establishment and maintenance of a transmission cycle of JEV and could lead to the virus becoming endemic in the United States.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28555073": "Zoonotic spillover, which is the transmission of a pathogen from a vertebrate animal to a human, presents a global public health burden but is a poorly understood phenomenon. Zoonotic spillover requires several factors to align, including the ecological, epidemiological and behavioural determinants of pathogen exposure, and the within-human factors that affect susceptibility to infection. In this Opinion article, we propose a synthetic framework for animal-to-human transmission that integrates the relevant mechanisms. This framework reveals that all zoonotic pathogens must overcome a hierarchical series of barriers to cause spillover infections in humans. Understanding how these barriers are functionally and quantitatively linked, and how they interact in space and time, will substantially improve our ability to predict or prevent spillover events.

As these events sometimes involve pathogens with epidemic or pandemic potential, they pose a serious threat to population health. Public policies may play a key role in preventing these events. The aim of this review is to identify evaluations of public policies that target the determinants of zoonotic spillover, examining approaches taken to evaluation, choice of outcomes measures and evidence of effectiveness. Our approach to identifying and analysing this literature will be informed by a One Health lens, acknowledging the interconnectedness of human, animal and environmental health.\nMETHODS AND ANALYSIS: A systematic scoping review methodology will be used. To identify articles, we will search Medline, SCOPUS, Web of Science and Global Health in May 2021 using search terms combining animal health and the animal-human interface, public policy, prevention and zoonoses. We will screen titles and abstracts and extract data according to published guidelines for scoping reviews. All evaluations of public policies aiming to prevent zoonotic spillover events will be eligible for inclusion. We will summarise key data from each study, mapping policies along the spillover pathway and outlining the range of policies, approaches to evaluation and outcome measures. Review findings will provide a useful reference for researchers and practitioners, outlining the state of the evaluative evidence around policies to prevent zoonotic spillover.\nETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Formal ethical approval is not required, because the study does not involve primary data collection.

The factors leading to such spillover events are little explored. Filoviridae viruses have a wide range of natural hosts and are unstable once outside hosts. Spillover events, which involve the physical transfer of viral particles across species, could therefore be directly promoted by conditions of host ecology and environment. In this report, we outline a proof of concept that temporal fluctuations of a set of ecological and environmental variables describing the dynamics of the host ecosystem are able to predict such events of Ebola virus spillover to humans and animals. We compiled a data set of climate and plant phenology variables and Ebola virus disease spillovers in humans and animals. We identified critical biotic and abiotic conditions for spillovers via multiple regression and neural network-based time series regression. Phenology variables proved to be overall better predictors than climate variables. African phenology variables are not yet available as a comprehensive online resource. Given the likely importance of phenology for forecasting the likelihood of future Ebola spillover events, our results highlight the need for cost-effective transect surveys to supply phenology data for predictive modelling efforts.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30506906": "INTRODUCTION: Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD) is a hereditary myopathy characterized as triad of muscular dystrophy, joint contractures, and conduction cardiomyopathy.

Targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) was performed to identify the underlying mutation in the proband and validated by Sanger sequencing. Segregation analysis was applied to all 13 participants.\nRESULTS: A novel frameshift mutation (c.253_254insT, p.Y85Lfs*8) of emerin gene (EMD) was found and co-segregated with family members.

However, this disorder is linked to 8 different genes encoding nuclear envelope proteins, raising the question of whether a particular protein is most relevant. Therefore, myoblast/fibroblast cultures from biopsy and tissue sections from a panel of nine Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy patients (4 male, 5 female) including those carrying emerin and FHL1 (X-linked) and several lamin A (autosomal dominant) mutations were stained for the proteins linked to the disorder. As tissue-specific nuclear envelope proteins have been postulated to mediate the tissue-specific pathologies of different nuclear envelopathies, patient samples were also stained for several muscle-specific nuclear membrane proteins. Although linked proteins nesprin 1 and SUN2 and muscle-specific proteins NET5/Samp1 and Tmem214 yielded aberrant distributions in individual patient cells, none exhibited defects through the larger patient panel. Muscle-specific Tmem38A normally appeared in both the nuclear envelope and sarcoplasmic reticulum, but most patient samples exhibited a moderate redistribution favouring the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The absence of striking uniform defects in nuclear envelope protein distribution indicates that such staining will be unavailing for general diagnostics, though it remains possible that specific mutations exhibiting protein distribution defects might reflect a particular clinical variant. These findings further argue that multiple pathways can lead to the generally similar pathologies of this disorder while at the same time the different cellular phenotypes observed possibly may help explain the considerable clinical variation of EDMD.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27179216": "Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD), a rare inherited disease, is characterized clinically by humero-peroneal muscle atrophy and weakness, multijoint contractures, spine rigidity and cardiac insufficiency with conduction defects.

The majority of the EDMD cases described so far are of the emerinopathy (EDMD1) kind, with a recessive X-linked mode of inheritance, or else laminopathy (EDMD2), with an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance.

EDMD is also distinctive for its association with defects of the cardiac conduction system that can result in sudden death. It can be inherited in an X-linked, autosomal dominant, or autosomal recessive fashion and is caused by mutations in proteins of the nuclear membrane. Mutations in the EMD gene, which encodes emerin, a transmembrane protein found at the inner nuclear membrane, are responsible for X-linked EDMD. The most common etiology of autosomal dominant EDMD is an LMNA gene mutation; LMNA encodes the intermediate filament protein lamins A and C, which constitute the major scaffolding protein of the inner nuclear membrane. Murine models of LMNA gene mutations have helped to identify different mechanisms of disease. Loss of LMNA function leads to nuclear fragility as well as other defects, such as abnormal nuclear function. Additional genes encoding nuclear membrane proteins such as SYNE1 and SYNE2 have also been implicated in EDMD, and in some cases their importance for cardiac and muscle function has been supported by animal modeling.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17567779": "Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD) is an inherited disorder characterized by slowly progressive skeletal muscle weakness in a humero-peroneal distribution, early contractures and prominent cardiomyopathy with conduction block.

Emerin and A-type lamins are proteins of the inner membrane of the nuclear envelope. Whereas the genetic cause of EDMD has been described and the proteins well characterized, little is known on how abnormalities in nuclear envelope proteins cause striated muscle disease. In this study, we analyzed genome-wide expression profiles in hearts from Emd knockout mice, a model of X-linked EDMD, using Affymetrix GeneChips. This analysis showed a molecular signature similar to that we previously described in hearts from Lmna H222P knock-in mice, a model of autosomal dominant EDMD. There was a common activation of the ERK1/2 branch of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway in both murine models, as well as activation of downstream targets implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiomyopathy.

We compared pregnancies with first trimester exposure to lamotrigine monotherapy to ASM-unexposed, carbamazepine, valproate, oxcarbazepine, levetiracetam, and topiramate to lamotrigine monotherapy, and stratified monotherapy groups by dose. The outcome was nongenetic MCM and specific subtypes. We estimated adjusted risk ratios (aRRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) with log-binomial regression and propensity score weights.\nRESULTS: There was a higher crude risk of any MCM in pregnancies exposed to lamotrigine monotherapy (n\u00a0=\u00a08,339) compared to ASM-unexposed pregnancies (n\u00a0=\u00a04,866,362), but not after confounder adjustment (aRR\u00a0=\u00a00.97, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.87-1.08). Compared to lamotrigine, there was an increased risk of malformations associated with valproate (n\u00a0=\u00a02,031, aRR\u00a0=\u00a02.05, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.70-2.46) and topiramate (n\u00a0=\u00a0509, aRR\u00a0=\u00a01.81, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.26-2.60), which increased in a dose-dependent manner. We found no differences in malformation risk for carbamazepine (n\u00a0=\u00a02,674, aRR\u00a0=\u00a00.91, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.72-1.15), oxcarbazepine (n\u00a0=\u00a01,313, aRR =\u20091.09, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.83-1.44), or levetiracetam (n\u00a0=\u00a01,040, aRR\u00a0=\u00a00.78, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.53-1.13). Valproate was associated with several malformation subtypes, including nervous system, cardiac, oral clefts, clubfoot, and hypospadias, whereas lamotrigine and carbamazepine were not.\nINTERPRETATION: Topiramate is associated with an increased risk of MCM similar to that associated with valproate, but lower doses may mitigate the risks for both drugs. Conversely, we found no increased risks for lamotrigine, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, or levetiracetam, which is reassuring.

For the German Pharmacoepidemiological Research Database (GePaRD), covering ~20% of the German population, algorithms have been developed to identify pregnancies, to estimate their date of onset and to link mothers to their babies. Using this methodology, we aimed to conduct a proof-of-concept analysis on the known association between valproate (VPA) exposure in early pregnancy and spina bifida in the exposed child.\nMETHODS: We identified all pregnancies in GePaRD between 2006 and 2016 in women aged 12 to 50\u2009years. To each VPA dispensation of these women, an exposure period was assigned, based on the dispensation date and the number of defined daily doses in the dispensed package. A pregnancy was classified as exposed to VPA in the critical time window if this exposure period overlapped with the first 55\u2009days of pregnancy. Risk ratios were calculated for spina bifida in live births and induced abortions comparing VPA-exposed ones to all pregnancies.\nRESULTS: Overall, we identified 1\u2009271\u2009384 pregnancies fulfilling the inclusion criteria. Of these, 668 pregnancies (0.053%) were classified as exposed to VPA in the critical time window regarding spina bifida. An induced abortion accompanied by a diagnosis of spina bifida was observed in one of the VPA-exposed pregnancies (0.15%) and in 154 of all pregnancies (0.012%), yielding a risk ratio of 12.4 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.7-88.2). Out of 775\u2009875 pregnancies ending in a live birth, 366 (0.047%) were classified as VPA exposed. A diagnosis of spina bifida was coded in 3 of 366 VPA-exposed live births (0.82%) and in 260 of all live births (0.03%), yielding a relative risk of 24.5 (95% CI: 7.9-76.0).\nCONCLUSIONS: Our proof-of-concept analysis based on GePaRD showed a strong association between intrauterine exposure to VPA and occurrence of spina bifida.

Clinical and demographic information from each database was transformed to the ConcePTION Common Data Model, quality checks were conducted and a distributed analysis was performed using common scripts. Incident and prevalent use of valproate, proportion of discontinuers and switchers to alternative medicine, frequency of contraception coverage during valproate use, and occurrence of pregnancies during valproate exposure were estimated per month. Interrupted time series analyses were conducted to estimate the level or trend change in the outcome measures.\nRESULTS: We included 69,533 valproate users from 9,699,371 females of childbearing potential from the five participating centres. A significant decline in prevalent use of valproates was observed in Tuscany, Italy (mean difference post-intervention -7.7%), Spain (-11.3%), and UK (-5.9%) and a non-significant decline in the Netherlands (-3.3%), but no decline in incident use after the 2018 RMMs compared to the period before. The monthly proportion of compliant valproate prescriptions/dispensings with a contraceptive coverage was low (<25%), with an increase after the 2018 RMMs only in the Netherlands (mean difference post-intervention 12%). There was no significant increase in switching rates from valproates to alternative medicine after the 2018 intervention in any of the countries/regions. We observed a substantial number of concurrent pregnancies during valproate exposure, but with a declining rate after the 2018 RMMs in Tuscany, Italy (0.70 per 1000 valproate users pre- and 0.27 post-intervention), Spain (0.48 and 0.13), the Netherlands (0.34 and 0.00), and an increasing rate in UK (1.13 and 5.07).\nCONCLUSION: There was a small impact of the 2018 RMMs on valproate use in the studied European countries/regions.

However, to date, there has been little synthesis of the strength, precision, and quality of this evidence in aggregate.\nOBJECTIVE: To grade the evidence from published meta-analyses of prospective observational studies that assessed the association of dietary patterns, specific foods, food groups, beverages (including alcohol), macronutrients, and micronutrients with the incidence of CRC.\nDATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched from database inception to September 2019.\nEVIDENCE REVIEW: Only meta-analyses of prospective observational studies with a cohort study design were eligible. Evidence of association was graded according to established criteria as follows: convincing, highly suggestive, suggestive, weak, or not significant.\nRESULTS: From 9954 publications, 222 full-text articles (2.2%) were evaluated for eligibility, and 45 meta-analyses (20.3%) that described 109 associations between dietary factors and CRC incidence were selected. Overall, 35 of the 109 associations (32.1%) were nominally statistically significant using random-effects meta-analysis models; 17 associations (15.6%) demonstrated large heterogeneity between studies (I2\u2009>\u200950%), whereas small-study effects were found for 11 associations (10.1%). Excess significance bias was not detected for any association between diet and CRC. The primary analysis identified 5 (4.6%) convincing, 2 (1.8%) highly suggestive, 10 (9.2%) suggestive, and 18 (16.5%) weak associations between diet and CRC, while there was no evidence for 74 (67.9%) associations. There was convincing evidence of an association of intake of red meat (high vs low) and alcohol (\u22654 drinks/d vs 0 or occasional drinks) with the incidence of CRC and an inverse association of higher vs lower intakes of dietary fiber, calcium, and yogurt with CRC risk. The evidence for convincing associations remained robust following sensitivity analyses.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This umbrella review found convincing evidence of an association between lower CRC risk and higher intakes of dietary fiber, dietary calcium, and yogurt and lower intakes of alcohol and red meat.

Epidemiological studies have shown that a high fat (or meat) intake is associated positively and a high starch, fibre (non-starch polysaccharide), vegetable and fruit intake negatively with colorectal cancer incidence. One mechanism by which these effects are possibly exerted is through the metabolism of secondary bile acids. Secondary bile acids are formed after enzymatic deconjugation and dehydroxylation of primary bile acids in the large bowel by anaerobic bacteria. It has been shown that these compounds can have tumour-promoting capacities in animal experiments. In epidemiological studies, colonic cancer risk is related to the faecal bile acid concentration. In serum and bile of patients with colonic adenomas, more deoxycholic acid was detected than in healthy controls. Secondary bile acids are toxic to several cell systems at physiological concentrations. The exact mechanism by which these amphiphilic molecules exert their action is not well understood. It might act through membrane damage, intracellular mitochondrial action or genotoxic effects. So far the evidence that bile acids are involved in colonic carcinogenesis is largely circumstantial. It is, however, well accepted that environmental factors, such as dietary habits influence genetic susceptibility. Bile acids could play a promoting role in this process.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29873077": "Distal and proximal colon tumors have distinct incidence trends and embryonic origins; whether these sub-sites have distinct susceptibilities to known risk factors is unclear. We used pooled data from 407,270 participants in three US-based studies, with overall median follow-up of 13.8 years. We used adjusted Cox models to analyze the association between dietary intakes (from diet history questionnaire) of total, processed and unprocessed red meat; total white meat, poultry and fish and meat-related compounds: heme iron, nitrate, nitrite, the heterocyclic amines (HCAs) and benzo(a)pyrene (B(a)P) and incidence of colorectal cancer subsites. The risk of colorectal cancer (n = 6,640) increased by 35% for each 50 g/1,000 kcal higher daily intake of total red meat, with a significant right-to-left trend from proximal colon (HR: 1.24; 95% CI: 1.09-1.39) to distal colon (HR: 1.34; 95% CI: 1.13-1.55) and rectum (HR: 1.53; 95% CI: 1.28-1.79).

The highest quintile of heme iron was associated with increased cancer risk only in the distal colon (HR: 1.20; 95% CI: 1.02-1.42) and rectum (HR: 1.27; 95% CI: 1.07-1.52). The highest quintile of HCAs, and nitrate/nitrite were associated with increased risk of total colorectal cancer, but these associations did not vary across anatomical subsites.

Conversely, the consumption of fruits, vegetables and fiber decreases the risk of CRC, which is why dietary polyphenols have aroused interest in recent years as potentially anti-carcinogenic compounds. One of the driving forces of colorectal carcinogenesis, in both sporadic and hereditary CRC, is the aberrant activation/regulation of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway. This review discusses reports of modulation of the Wnt/\u03b2-Catenin signaling pathway by dietary polyphenols (resveratrol, avenanthramides, epigallocatechinin, curcumin, quercetin, silibinin, genistein and mangiferin) specifically focusing on CRC, and proposes a model as to how this modulation occurs. There is potential for implementing these dietary polyphenols into preventative and therapeutic therapies for CRC as evidenced by some clinical trials that have been carried out with promising results.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36992261": "DNA integrity is a key issue in gene therapy and genetic vaccine approaches based on plasmid DNA. In contrast to messenger RNA that requires a controlled cold chain for efficacy, DNA molecules are considered to be more stable. In this study, we challenged this concept by characterizing the immunological response induced by a plasmid DNA vaccine delivered using electroporation. As a model, we used COVID-eVax, a plasmid DNA-based vaccine that targets the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Increased nicked DNA was produced by using either an accelerated stability protocol or a lyophilization protocol. Surprisingly, the immune response induced in vivo was only minimally affected by the percentage of open circular DNA. This result suggests that plasmid DNA vaccines, such as COVID-eVax that have recently completed a phase I clinical trial, retain their efficacy upon storage at higher temperatures, and this feature may facilitate their use in low-/middle-income countries.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38063059": "INTRODUCTION: Nucleic acids represent a promising platform for creating vaccines. One disadvantage of this approach is its relatively low immunogenicity. Electroporation (EP) is an effective way to increase the DNA vaccines immunogenicity. However, due to the different configurations of devices used for EP, EP protocols optimization is required not only to enhance immunogenicity, but also to ensure greater safety and tolerability of the EP procedure.\nAREA COVERED: An data analysis for recent years on the DNA vaccines delivery against viral and parasitic infections using EP was carried out. The study of various EP physical characteristics, such as frequency, pulse duration, pulse interval, should be considered along with the immunogenic construct design and the site of delivery of the vaccine, through the study of the immunogenic and protective characteristics of the latter.\nEXPERT OPINION: Future research should focus on regulating the humoral and cellular response required for protection against infectious agents by modifying the EP protocol. Significant efforts will be directed to establishing the possibility of redirecting the immune response toward the Th1 or Th2 response by changing the EP physical parameters. It will allow for an individual selective approach during EP, depending on the pathogen type of an infectious disease.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15110305": "DNA vaccines are attracting increased attention due to multiple advantages over conventional vaccines. Attempts to improve these vaccines focus on enhancing DNA delivery and employing novel immunoadjuvants. Electroporation (EP) has emerged as an effective method for delivering DNA vaccines, significantly enhancing humoral and cellular responses. To further improve EP-augmented DNA vaccination, we used micron-size gold particles as a particulate adjuvant. DNA is not bound, or adsorbed, to the particles. Gold particles were coinjected intradermally with plasmid DNA encoding the hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) into mice, both in the absence and presence of noninvasive EP. The particles enhanced the percentage of responding animals, and shortened the time for reaching maximal antibody titers by 2 weeks. Subtyping of the produced antibodies revealed a predominantly Th1-like response which did not change significantly with the absence or presence of particles. The particles likely function as an attractant for antigen-presenting cells (APCs), and probably do not affect EP or antigen expression to a significant extent. We conclude that micron-size gold particles injected intradermally together with DNA followed by EP give rise to an accelerated, potent immune response with a strong cellular component. This method may become important for the development of fast-acting therapeutic and prophylactic vaccines.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19619001": "We are evaluating the use of electroporation (EP) to deliver a novel DNA vaccine, p.DOM-PSMA(27).

We report on safety and tolerability and on antibody response to DOM as a first indication of the effect of EP in patients. In this open label phase I/II, two-arm, dose escalation trial DNA was delivered either by intramuscular injection or by intramuscular injection followed by EP (DNA+EP), with five patients per dose level. Three vaccinations were given at 0, 4, and 8 weeks,with booster doses at 24 and 48 weeks; here we allowed crossover between study arms if supported by the safety and immunological data. In the 20 patients in the first two dose cohorts we observed that beyond brief and acceptable pain at the injection site, EP did not appear to add toxicity to the vaccination. We evaluated humoral responses to DOM. Low anti-DOM IgG antibody responses were observed after intramuscular injection of DNA without EP (at week 12: mean 1.7- vs. 24.5-fold increase over baseline with DNA+EP). These could be boosted by delivery of DNA+EP at later time points. Delivery of DNA+EP at all five vaccinations yielded the highest levels of anti-DOM antibody. Responses persisted to 18 months of follow-up. These data establish EP as a potent method for stimulating humoral responses induced by DNA vaccination in humans.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21180650": "The without a doubt major obstacle for making DNA vaccines a commercial success is delivery. If delivery cannot be made simple, cheap and effective, DNA vaccines may not become a viable option for human use. Numerous clinical trials have confirmed that a standard needle and syringe simply do not do the job, i.e., delivering the DNA payload inside the cell. Having recognized this shortcoming, investigators have developed several new approaches for DNA vaccine delivery. In particular, new types of delivery devices, originally intended for in vitro use, have been applied for in vivo delivery. These include particle bombardment or biolistic delivery, and in vivo electroporation (EP). Importantly, both techniques seem to overcome the size barrier, meaning that they work in both mice and larger animals. In vivo EP has the key features of improved DNA uptake, increased antigen expression and a local inflammation. These factors are essential to make DNA vaccines effective in a larger host. Early data from clinical trials with DNA vaccines delivered by in vivo EP are cautiously promising. Thus, we may be entering a new era of DNA vaccination where we start to see clinical effects in humans; however, these may also be accompanied by side effects, as the vaccines become more effective.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36680212": "Measles is a highly contagious, but vaccine-preventable disease caused by the measles virus (MeV). Although the administration of two doses of measles vaccines is the most effective strategy to prevent and eliminate measles, MeV continues to spread worldwide, even in 2022. In measles-eliminated countries, preparedness and response to measles outbreaks originating from imported cases are required to maintain elimination status. Under these circumstances, real-time reverse transcription (RT) PCR for MeV could provide a diagnostic method capable of strengthening the subnational capacity for outbreak responses. Real-time RT-PCR can detect MeV RNA from patients with measles at the initial symptomatic stage, which can enable rapid public health responses aimed at detecting their contacts and common sources of infection. Furthermore, low cycle threshold (Ct) values (i.e., high viral load) of throat swabs indicate high infectiousness in patients with measles. The high basic reproduction number of measles suggests that patients with high infectiousness can easily become super-spreaders. This opinion proposes a possible strategy of rapid and intensive responses to counter measles outbreaks caused by super-spreader candidates showing low Ct values in throat swabs.

Complications of measles affect most organ systems, with pneumonia accounting for most measles-associated morbidity and mortality. The management of patients with measles includes provision of vitamin A. Measles is best prevented through vaccination, and the major reductions in measles incidence and mortality have renewed interest in regional elimination and global eradication.

A resurgence in measles cases was already occurring before the COVID-19 pandemic, which has affected global immunisation programmes, resulting in millions of children, mostly in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs), missing out on their measles vaccine. This will leave many children living in the most vulnerable of circumstances highly susceptible to measles and RSV infections when current COVID-19 public health control measures are lifted.

Eradication of measles is feasible because of several key attributes, including humans as the only reservoir for the virus, broad access to diagnostic tools that can rapidly detect measles-infectious persons, and availability of highly safe and effective measles-containing vaccines (MCVs). All 6 World Health Organization (WHO) regions have established measles elimination goals. Globally, during 2000-2018, measles incidence decreased by 66% (from 145 to 49 cases per million population) and deaths decreased by 73% (from 535 600 to 142 300), drastically reducing global disease burden. Routine immunization with MCV has been the cornerstone for the control and prevention of measles. Two doses of MCV are 97% effective in preventing measles, qualifying MCV as one of the most effective vaccines ever developed. Mild adverse events occur in <20% of recipients and serious adverse events are extremely rare. The economic benefits of measles vaccination are highlighted by an overall return on investment of 58 times the cost of the vaccine, supply chains, and vaccination. Because measles is one of the most contagious human diseases, maintenance of high (\u226595%) 2-dose MCV coverage is crucial for controlling the spread of measles and successfully reaching measles elimination; however, the plateauing of global MCV coverage for nearly a decade and the global measles resurgence during 2018-2019 demonstrate that much work remains.

The method was based on a rapid extraction protocol from 50 \u03bcL human plasma and separation on a reversed-phase C-18 HPLC column after the addition of deuterated internal standards. Accurate analyte quantification using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) detection was then obtained using a Thermofisher Quantiva triple-quadrupole MS coupled to an Ultimate 3000 UHPLC. The method has been validated following international (EMA) guidelines for bioanalytical method validation and has been tested on plasma samples from 62 CF patients treated with the three-drug combination IVA/TEZ/ELX, marketed as Kaftrio\u00ae or Trikafta\u00ae, in steady-state condition. The assay was linear over wide concentration ranges (0.008-12 mg/L) in plasma for IVA, TEZ, and ELX, suitable for a broad range of plasma concentrations, and accurate and reproducible in the absence of matrix effects. The stability of analytes for at least 30 days at room temperature could allow for cost-effective shipment and storage. On the same day of sample collection, a sweat test was evaluated for 26 associated patients' samples, FEV1 (%) for 58, and BMI was calculated for 62. However, Spearman correlation showed no correlation between C<sub>through</sub> plasma concentrations of analytes (IVA, TEZ, ELX) and sweat test, FEV1 (%), or BMI. Our method proved to be suitable for TDM and could be helpful in assessing dose-concentration-response correlations in larger studies.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34026156": "We present a novel case of an urticaria multiforme-type drug reaction to the new cystic fibrosis medication Trikafta (elexacaftor + tezacaftor + ivacaftor).

Healthcare systems face significant challenges in integrating these treatments, with uncertainty in prevalence and optimal testing methods to identify eligible patients. We performed a systematic review of NTRK fusion prevalence to inform efficient diagnostic screening and scale of therapeutic uptake. We searched Medline, Embase and Cochrane databases on 31/03/2021. Inclusion criteria were studies reporting fusion rates in solid tumours, English language, post-2010 publication and minimum sample size. Critical appraisal was performed using a custom 11-item checklist. Rates were collated by cancer type and pooled if additional synthesis criteria were met. 160 studies were included, with estimates for 15 pan-cancer and 429 specific cancer types (63 paediatric). Adult pan-cancer estimates ranged 0.03-0.70%, with higher rates found in RNA-based assays. In common cancers, rates were consistently below 0.5%. Rare morphological subtypes, colorectal microsatellite instability, and driver mutation exclusion cancers had higher rates. Only 35.6% of extracted estimates used appropriate methods and sample size to identify NTRK fusions. NTRK fusion-positive cancers are rare and widely distributed across solid tumours.

Binding of neurotrophins to TRK proteins induces receptor dimerization, phosphorylation, and activation of the downstream signaling cascades via PI3K, RAS/MAPK/ERK, and PLC-gamma. TRK pathway aberrations, including gene fusions, protein overexpression, and single nucleotide alterations, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of many cancer types, with NTRK gene fusions being the most well validated oncogenic events to date. Although the NTRK gene fusions are infrequent in most cancer types, certain rare tumor types are predominately driven by these events. Conversely, in more common histologies, such as lung and colorectal cancers, prevalence of the NTRK fusions is well below 5%. Selective inhibition of TRK signaling may therefore be beneficial among patients whose tumors vary in histologies, but share underlying oncogenic NTRK gene alterations. Currently, several TRK-targeting compounds are in clinical development. The ongoing Phase 2 trials with entrectinib and LOXO-101, two of the leading TRK inhibitors, are designed as 'basket trials', inclusive of patients whose tumors harbor NTRK gene fusions, independent of histology. Additional Phase 1 studies of other TRK inhibitors, including MGCD516, PLX7486, DS-6051b, and TSR-011, are underway. Interim data examining NTRK-rearranged tumors treated with entrectinib or LOXO-101 demonstrate encouraging activity, with patients achieving rapid and durable responses.

Limited data exist on the overall survival (OS) of patients with tumors with NTRK gene fusions and on the co-occurrence of NTRK fusions with other oncogenic drivers.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included patients enrolled in the Genomics England 100,000 Genomes Project who had linked clinical data from UK databases. Patients who had undergone tumor whole genome sequencing between March 2016 and July 2019 were included. Patients with and without NTRK fusions were matched. OS was analyzed along with oncogenic alterations in ALK, BRAF, EGFR, ERBB2, KRAS, and ROS1, and tumor mutation burden (TMB) and microsatellite instability (MSI).\nRESULTS: Of 15,223 patients analyzed, 38 (0.25%) had NTRK gene fusions in 11 tumor types, the most common were breast cancer, colorectal cancer (CRC), and sarcoma. Median OS was not reached in both the NTRK gene fusion-positive and -negative groups (hazard ratio 1.47, 95% CI 0.39-5.57, P\u00a0=\u00a00.572). A KRAS mutation was identified in two (5%) patients with NTRK gene fusions, and both had hepatobiliary cancer. High TMB and MSI were both more common in patients with NTRK gene fusions, due to the CRC subset. While there was a higher risk of death in patients with NTRK gene fusions compared to those without, the difference was not statistically significant.\nCONCLUSION: This study supports the hypothesis that NTRK gene fusions are primary oncogenic drivers and the co-occurrence of NTRK gene fusions with other oncogenic alterations is rare.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34402529": "Neurotrophic tropomyosin receptor kinase (NTRK) gene fusions are emerging tissue-agnostic drug targets in malignancies including colorectal carcinomas (CRCs), but their detailed landscape in the context of various colorectal carcinogenesis pathways remains to be investigated. In this study, pan-tropomyosin receptor kinase (TRK) protein expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in retrospectively collected colorectal epithelial tumor tissues, including 441 CRCs [133 microsatellite instability-high (MSI-high) and 308 microsatellite stable (MSS)] and 595 premalignant colorectal lesions (330 serrated lesions and 265 conventional adenomas). TRK-positive cases were then subjected to next-generation sequencing and/or fluorescence in situ hybridization to confirm NTRK rearrangements. TRK IHC positivity was not observed in any of the MSS CRCs, conventional adenomas, traditional serrated adenomas, or hyperplastic polyps, whereas TRK positivity was observed in 11 of 58 (19%) MLH1-methylated MSI-high CRCs, 4 of 23 (17%) sessile serrated lesions with dysplasia (SSLDs), and 5 of 132 (4%) sessile serrated lesions (SSLs). The 11 TRK-positive MSI-high CRCs commonly harbored CpG island methylator phenotype-high (CIMP-high), MLH1 methylation, BRAF/KRAS wild-type, and NTRK1 or NTRK3 fusion (TPM3-NTRK1, TPR-NTRK1, LMNA-NTRK1, SFPQ-NTRK1, ETV6-NTRK3, or EML4-NTRK3). Both NTRK1 or NTRK3 rearrangement and BRAF/KRAS wild-type were detected in all nine TRK-positive SSL(D)s, seven of which demonstrated MSS and/or CIMP-low. TRK expression was selectively observed in distorted serrated crypts within SSLs and was occasionally localized at the base of serrated crypts. NTRK fusions were detected only in SSLs of patients aged \u226550\u2009years, whereas BRAF mutation was found in younger age-onset SSLs. In conclusion, NTRK-rearranged colorectal tumors develop exclusively through the serrated neoplasia pathway and can be initiated from non-dysplastic SSLs without BRAF/KRAS mutations prior to full occurrence of MSI-high/CIMP-high. \u00a9 2021 The Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

Development of new monoclonal antibodies targeting one or a few single cytokines, including anti-tumor necrosis factor agents, anti-IL 12/23 inhibitors, and anti-\u03b14\u03b27 integrin inhibitors, have dominated the pharmacological armamentarium in IBD in the last 20 years. Still, many patients experience incomplete or loss of response or develop serious adverse events and drug discontinuation. Janus kinase (JAK) is key to modulating the signal transduction pathway of several proinflammatory cytokines directly involved in gastrointestinal inflammation and, thus, probably IBD pathogenesis. Targeting the JAK-STAT pathway offers excellent potential for the treatment of IBD. The European Medical Agency has approved three JAK inhibitors for treating adults with moderate to severe Ulcerative Colitis when other treatments, including biological agents, have failed or no longer work or if the patient cannot take them. Although there are currently no approved JAK inhibitors for Crohn's disease, upadacitinib and filgotinib have shown increased remission rates in these patients.

The RNAseq colon tissue data from clinical studies of TNF-IR Crohn's disease patients treated with upadacitinib or risankizumab were used to identify TNF-IR mechanisms that were favorably modified by upadacitinib and risankizumab.\nRESULTS: We found 7 TNF-IR upregulated modules related to innate/adaptive immune responses, interferon signaling, and tissue remodeling and 6 TNF-IR upregulated cell types related to inflammatory fibroblasts, postcapillary venules, inflammatory monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, and cycling B cells. Upadacitinib was associated with a significant decrease in the expression of most TNF-IR upregulated modules in JAK1 responders (JAK1-R); in contrast, there was no change in these modules among TNF-IR patients treated with a placebo or among JAK1 inadequate responders (JAK1-IR). In addition, 4 of the 6 TNF-IR upregulated cell types were significantly decreased after upadacitinib treatment in JAK1-R but not among subjects treated with a placebo or among JAK1-IR patients.

Tofacitinib, a non-selective small molecule JAK inhibitor, and\u00a0upadacitinib and filgotinib, which are selective JAK-1 inhibitors, have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for moderate-to-severe active ulcerative colitis. Compared to biological drugs, JAK inhibitors have a short half-life, rapid onset of action, and no immunogenicity. Both clinical trials and real-world evidence support the use of JAK inhibitors in the treatment of IBD. However, these therapies have been linked with multiple adverse events (AEs) including infection, hypercholesterolemia, venous thromboembolism, major adverse cardiovascular events, and malignancy. While early studies recognized several potential AEs, post-marketing trials have shown that tofacitinib may increase the risk of thromboembolic diseases and major cardiovascular events. The latter are seen in patients aged 50 years or older with cardiovascular risk factors. Hence, the\u00a0benefits of treatment and risk stratification need to be considered when positioning tofacitinib.

Resected mesenteric lymph node [MLN] cells from 19 patients [9 CD, 10 UC] were analysed by flow cytometry in the presence or absence of different cytokine stimuli and titrated JAKinibs.\nRESULTS: We found a higher potency of the JAK 1/3-preferential inhibitor, tofacitinib, for JAK 3-dependent cytokine signalling pathways in comparison to filgotinib, but a higher potency of the JAK 1-preferential inhibitors, filgotinib and upadacitinib, for JAK 3-independent cytokine signalling pathways. Deucravacitinib, a TYK2-preferential inhibitor, demonstrated a much narrower selectivity by inhibiting only IL-10 and IFN-\u03b2 pathways, albeit more potently than the other JAKinibs. Additionally, we found some differences in the sensitivity of immune cells from CD versus UC, and patients with versus without a CD-associated NOD2 polymorphism, to phosphorylate signal transducer and activator of transcriptions in response to specific cytokine stimulation.\nCONCLUSIONS: Despite their similarities, differences exist in the relative potencies of different JAKinibs against distinct cytokine families, to explain their clinical efficacy.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37365258": "In areas of moderate to intense Plasmodium falciparum transmission, malaria in pregnancy remains a significant cause of low birth weight, stillbirth, and severe anaemia.

Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps were generated, with values from 5 healthy individuals serving as controls.\nRESULTS: Patients with SNCM had a wide spectrum of cerebral ADC values, including both decreased and increased values compared with controls. Patients with low ADC values, indicating cytotoxic edema, showed hypoxic patterns similar to cerebral malaria despite the absence of deep coma. Conversely, high ADC values, indicative of mild vasogenic edema, were observed in both patients with SNCM and patients with UM. Brain involvement was confirmed by elevated circulating levels of S100B. Creatinine was negatively correlated with ADC in SNCM, suggesting an association between acute kidney injury and cytotoxic brain changes.\nCONCLUSIONS: Brain involvement is common in adults with SNCM and a subgroup of hospitalized patients with UM, which warrants closer neurological follow-up.

BAFF is an instrumental cytokine for the development and maintenance of B cells.

DMD is a rare disease that worsens over time. People with DMD experience inflammation in their muscles and muscle loss over time. They also experience bone problems such as an abnormally bent spine, also known as scoliosis, as well as heart and lung problems.\nWHAT HAPPENED IN THE CINCINNATI STUDY?: Prednisone and deflazacort are steroids that help to reduce muscle inflammation and are used as treatments for DMD. The study researchers wanted to further understand the differences between using prednisone and deflazacort in males with DMD by reviewing data from past medical records of patients seen in clinics rather than in clinical studies.

Despite the phenomenal advances made in the understanding of the molecular genetics of the disease, no definitive cure has been found. Of all of the therapeutic drugs studied in Duchenne muscular dystrophy, only prednisone seems to have the potential for providing interim functional improvement for boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy while they wait for a cure with gene or cell therapy. There is still no consensus regarding recommending corticosteroids as standard therapy for boys. This is an evidence-based review of all of the studies of corticosteroids (prednisone, deflazacort, and oxandrolone) in Duchenne muscular dystrophy. From this review, it is clear that until a definitive treatment for Duchenne muscular dystrophy is available, the use of deflazacort and prednisone with judicious dietary control and close clinical monitoring for side effects seems the best intervention for interim preservation of function in such a common devastating disorder of young growing boys.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36411210": "INTRODUCTION: Chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapies have revolutionized the treatment paradigm for heavily pretreated B-cell malignancies such as large B-cell lymphoma. There is a major unmet need for effective treatments for heavily pretreated relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM), for which many CAR-T therapies are under active clinical investigation. Goal of the review: This review provides an overview of recently updated clinical trial data and indirect treatment comparison analyses regarding two clinically advanced CAR-T therapies, idecabtagene vicleucel (ide-cel) and ciltacabtagene autoleucel (cilta-cel).\nDISCUSSION: Recently presented data after prolonged follow-up periods for ide-cel (KarMMa) and cilta-cel (CARTITUDE-1) have demonstrated that both therapies have the potential to elicit responses in individuals with heavily pretreated RRMM. Indirect treatment comparisons between cilta-cel and ide-cel suggest cilta-cel is associated with deeper and more durable responses than ide-cel in triple class-exposed RRMM; however, these types of comparisons have limitations and direct head-to-head trials are needed to confirm these findings. Additional indirect treatment comparisons conducted separately for ide-cel and cilta-cel have demonstrated that these CAR-T therapies hold promise for substantial clinical benefit relative to currently available treatments for RRMM. Further considerations, including safety profiles and real-world treatment considerations, are also discussed.\nCONCLUSION: Data collected to date support CAR-T therapies holding substantial promise for patients with heavily pretreated RRMM relative to other currently available therapies.

All the patients had received one to three previous lines of treatment. The primary outcome was progression-free survival.\nRESULTS: A total of 419 patients underwent randomization (208 to receive cilta-cel and 211 to receive standard care). At a median follow-up of 15.9 months (range, 0.1 to 27.3), the median progression-free survival was not reached in the cilta-cel group and was 11.8 months in the standard-care group (hazard ratio, 0.26; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.18 to 0.38; P<0.001).

However, not all individuals with colonic adenomas have a risk of CRC substantially higher than those of the general population. The aim of the study was to determine the differences or similarities of mutation profile among low- and high-grade adenomas and in situ carcinoma with detailed follow up. We have investigated the mutation spectrum of well-known genes involved in CRC (such as APC, BRAF, EGFR, NRAS, KRAS, PIK3CA, POLE, POLD1, SMAD4, PTEN, and TP53) in a large, well-defined series of 96 adenomas and in situ carcinomas using a high-throughput genotyping technique. Besides, the microsatellite instability and APC and MLH1 promoter methylation were studied as well. We observed a high frequency of pathogenic variants in the studied genes. The APC, KRAS and TP53 mutation frequencies were slightly lower in adenoma samples than in in situ carcinoma samples. Further, when we stratified mutation frequency based on the grade, the frequency distribution was as follows: low-grade adenoma-high-grade adenomas-in situ carcinoma: APC gene 42.9-56.0-54.5%; KRAS gene 32.7-32.0-45.5%; TP53 gene 8.2-20.0-18.2%. The occurrence of KRAS mutation was associated with the presence of villous histology and methylation of the APC promoter was significantly associated with the presence of POLE genetic variations. However, no association was noticed with the presence of any singular mutation and occurrence of subsequent adenoma or CRC.

Recently, molecular abnormalities underlying the adenomacarcinoma progression have been defined. The adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene and mismatch repair genes are found to be dysfunctional early in the neoplastic process; either as inherited or somatic mutations. Subsequently, polyps progress to cancer along one of two paths depending on which gene is abnormal. When the APC gene is the initial mutation tumor development follows the \"loss of heterozygocity\" (LOH) pathway. If mismatch repair genes are altered, the \"replication error\" (RER) pathway is followed. Somatic mutations of the K-ras oncogene and the MCC, DCC, and p53 tumor suppressor genes accumulate in the LOH pathway and mark the progression through polyp stages. Microsatellite instability is a characteristic of the RER pathway but the precise genes involved in this pathway currently are not known.

We analyzed the mutation profile and copy number changes of 25 adenomas and adjacent mucosa from 12 familial adenomatous polyposis patients using whole-exome sequencing and validated allelic imbalances (AI) in 37 adenomas using SNP arrays. We assessed for evidence of clonality and performed estimations on the proportions of driver and passenger mutations using a systems biology approach. Adenomas had lower mutational rates than did colorectal cancers and showed recurrent alterations in known cancer driver genes (APC, KRAS, FBXW7, TCF7L2) and AIs in chromosomes 5, 7, and 13. Moreover, 80% of adenomas had somatic alterations in WNT pathway genes. Adenomas displayed evidence of multiclonality similar to stage I carcinomas. Strong correlations between mutational rate and patient age were observed in at-risk mucosa and adenomas. Our data indicate that at least 23% of somatic mutations are present in at-risk mucosa prior to adenoma initiation. The genomic profiles of at-risk mucosa and adenomas illustrate the evolution from normal tissue to carcinoma via greater resolution of molecular changes at the inflection point of premalignant lesions.

The DNA of the carcinomatous cells frequently has mutations in several genes. However, it is not exactly clear when during the neoplastic process each mutation develops. An adenoma with an area of in situ carcinoma provides an opportunity to evaluate genetic changes within a single neoplasia whose separate areas are comprised of both the benign adenoma as well as the malignant carcinoma.\nMETHODS: Thirty-seven neoplasms with areas of both benign adenoma and in situ carcinoma were studied. Both portions were evaluated for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene and for mutations in codons 12/13 of the K-ras oncogene using the polymerase chain reaction technique.\nRESULTS: Twenty-eight neoplasms showed no LOH in either portion whereas both portions of 4 neoplasms revealed a loss of heterozygosity. In three lesions the APC gene was normal in the adenomatous portion but LOH was present in the carcinomatous portion. Two neoplasms were uninformative for LOH of the APC gene. Thirteen neoplasms showed the wild-type pattern for the K-ras oncogene whereas 15 contained the identical mutation in both portions. Of the remaining nine neoplasms, six had a K-ras mutation in the adenomatous portion only and three had one pattern in the adenomatous portion and a different pattern in the in situ carcinoma portion.\nCONCLUSIONS: LOH of the APC gene is an early and persistent feature in the evolution of a benign colorectal adenoma into an in situ carcinoma.

The cancers were further evaluated for mucinous status and microsatellite instability. Standard PCR molecular techniques were used for KRAS and microsatellite analyses. A KRAS mutation was found in 61.9% of 134 adenomas, 67.8% of 84 in situ carcinomas, and just 31.6% of 171 carcinomas. Our study clearly demonstrates that tubulovillous and villous adenomas, as well as both the benign and malignant parts of in situ carcinomas, are statistically more likely to contain a somatic KRAS gene mutation than colorectal carcinomas. This difference is confined to the non-mucinous and the microsatellite stable tumors.

As such, the structure and characteristics of food systems can be considered key determinants of modern pandemic risks. This means that emerging infectious diseases should be more explicitly addressed in the discourse of food systems to mitigate the likelihood and impacts of spillover events. Here, we adopt a scenario framework to highlight the many connections among food systems, zoonotic diseases, and sustainability. We identify two overarching dimensions: the extent of land use for food production and the agricultural practices employed that shape four archetypal food systems, each with a distinct risk profile with respect to zoonotic spillovers and differing dimensions of sustainability. Prophylactic measures to curb the emergence of zoonotic diseases are therefore closely linked to diets and food policies.

Interspecies contacts and host populations vary with the proportion of land converted; enabling us to quantify infection risk across a changing landscape. In a range of scenarios, the highest spillover risk occurs at intermediate levels of habitat loss, whereas the largest, but rarest, epidemics occur at extremes of land conversion.

Regions of high predicted bat coronavirus prevalence coincide with global disease hotspots, suggesting that infection prevalence in wildlife may be an important factor underlying links between human land modification and zoonotic disease emergence.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33052311": "The health and economic impacts of infectious disease pandemics are catastrophic as most recently manifested by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The emerging infections that lead to substantive epidemics or pandemics are typically zoonoses that cross species boundaries at vulnerable points of animal-human interface. The sharing of space between wildlife and humans, and their domesticated animals, has dramatically increased in recent decades and is a key driver of pathogen spillover. Increasing animal-human interface has also occurred in concert with both increasing globalisation and failing health systems, resulting in a trifecta with dire implications for human and animal health. Nevertheless, to date we lack a geographical description of this trifecta that can be applied strategically to pandemic prevention. This investigation provides the first geographical quantification of the intersection of animal-human interfaces, poor human health system performance and global connectivity via the network of air travel. In so doing, this work provides a systematic, data-driven approach to classifying spillover hazard based on the distribution of animal-human interfaces while simultaneously identifying globally connected cities that are adjacent to these interfaces and which may facilitate global pathogen dissemination. We present this geography of high-impact spillover as a tool for developing targeted surveillance systems and improved health infrastructure in vulnerable areas that may present conduits for future pandemics.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35656052": "BACKGROUND: Pain assessment in unconscious patients is a major challenge for healthcare providers. This study aims to compare the diagnostic value of the critical-care pain observation tool (CPOT) and the behavioral pain scale (BPS) for pain assessment among unconscious patients.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted in 2019. Forty-five unconscious patients were selected randomly from four general intensive care units (ICUs) in the north of Iran. The discriminant validity of CPOT and BPS were evaluated for pain during a nociceptive and a nonnociceptive procedure. For reliability assessment, interrater agreement was obtained using Lin's concordance correlation coefficient and weighted kappa coefficient.\nRESULTS: Patients who had been hospitalized in ICU due to surgery or trauma (57.70%) or medical problems (42.30%) were studied. During the nociceptive procedure, the mean scores of CPOT and BPS and all their dimensions, except for the compliance with ventilator dimension, were significantly greater than the nonnociceptive procedure (p &lt;0.05) although the effect size of both instruments was small (0.32 vs 0.18). The Lin's concordance correlation coefficient in nonnociceptive and nociceptive procedures was respectively 0.67 and 0.62 for CPOT and 0.74 and 0.88 for BPS.\nCONCLUSION: CPOT and BPS have acceptable discriminant validity in differentiating nonnociceptive and nociceptive procedural pain although the effect size of CPOT is larger than that of BPS. Although both instruments have low reliability, the reliability of BPS is better.\nHOW TO CITE THIS ARTICLE: Nazari R, Froelicher ES, Nia HS, Hajihosseini F, Mousazadeh N.

PB_2016-02324].\nSETTING: A total of 49 ICU patients from cardiovascular, visceral and thoracic surgery and neurology and neurosurgery were recruited. Data from 24 patients were analyzed.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Three independent observers assessed pain with the BPS, the CPOT or ZOPA prior, during and after a potential painful nursing intervention. Tools were randomized concerning the pain management after each pain assessment. Frequency of nine additional pain indicating items from a previous qualitative, explorative study was calculated.\nRESULTS: ZOPA was positive in 32 of 33 measuring cycles (97.0%; 95%CI: 84.2-99.9%), followed by the CPOT (28/33 cycles, 84.8%; 95%CI: 68.1-94.9%) and the BPS (23/33 cycles, 67.0%; 95%CI: 51.3-84.4%). In 22/33 cycles all tools were concordant (66.7%; 95%CI: 48.2-82.0%). Analgesics were provided in 29 out of 33 cycles (87.9%; 95%CI: 71.8-96.6%). Additional pain indicating items were inconsistently reported.\nCONCLUSION: ZOPA is concordant with the BPS and the CPOT to indicate pain but detects pain earlier due to the low threshold value.

Many patients hospitalised in ICU are not able to speak and express their pain due to various causes, including mechanical ventilation, reduced consciousness, and administration of sedative drugs. Therefore, the use of observational and behavioural pain tools is recommended in this group of patients given their inability to express pain.\nAIM: To examine the existing observational and behavioural tools for assessment of in Nonverbal Intubated Critically Adult Patients after Open-Heart Surgery.\nMETHODS: A systematic review of available observational and behavioural tools for assessment of pain was undertaken using the COSMIN checklist. A literature search was conducted using the following databases: Ovid, Science Direct, Scopus, PubMed, and CINHAL databases, Google Scholar search engine as well as Persian resources Sid, Magiran, Iran doc, and IranMedex up to the end of 2017 were reviewed.\nRESULTS: A total of 47 studies that had examined five tools used in intensive care units after cardiac surgery in patients under mechanical ventilation were reviewed. Each of the five tools included behavioural and observational items, and only one tool had physiological items. All the tools had been evaluated regarding validity and reliability. In the three tools, sensitivity, specificity, responsiveness, and satisfaction were considered.\nCONCLUSION: Based on available evidence and investigations, CPOT and BPS tools have good validity and reliability to be used in pain assessment in Nonverbal Intubated Critically Adult Patients after Open-Heart Surgery.

Nearly 30% of patients experience pain at rest, while the percentage increases to 50% during nursing procedures. Pain in ICU patients can be divided into four categories: continuous ICU treatment-related pain/discomfort, acute illness-related pain, intermittent procedural pain and pre-existing chronic pain present before ICU admission. As daily nursing procedures and interventions performed in the ICU may be a potential source of pain, it is crucial to use simple pain monitoring tools. The assessment of pain intensity in ICU patients remains an everyday challenge for clinicians, especially in sedated, intubated and mechanically ventilated patients. Regular assessment of pain intensity leads to improved outcome and better quality of life of patients in the ICU and after discharge from ICU. The gold standard in pain evaluation is patient self-reporting, which is not always possible. Current research shows that the two tools best validated for patients unable to self-report pain are the Behavioral Pain Scale (BPS) and the Critical Care Pain Observation Tool (CPOT). Although international guidelines recommend the use of validated tools for pain evaluation, they underline the need for translation into a given language. The authors of this publication obtained an official agreement from the authors of the two behavioral scales - CPOT and BPS - for translation into Polish. Validation of these tools in the Polish population will aid their wider use in pain assessment in ICUs in Poland.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27833752": "BACKGROUND: Critically ill patients admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) may suffer from different painful stimuli, but the assessment of pain is difficult because most of them are almost sedated and unable to self-report. Thus, it is important to optimize evaluation of pain in these patients. The main aim of this study was to compare two commonly used scales for pain evaluation: Critical Care Pain Observation Tool (CPOT) and Behavioral Pain Scale (BPS), in both conscious and unconscious patients. Secondary aims were (1) to identifying the most relevant parameters to determine pain scales changes during nursing procedures, (2) to compare both pain scales with visual analog scale (VAS), and (3) to identify the best combination of scales for evaluation of pain in patients unable to communicate.\nMETHODS: In this observational study, 101 patients were evaluated for a total of 303 consecutive observations during 3\u00a0days after ICU admission. Measurements with both scales were obtained 1\u00a0min before, during, and 20\u00a0min after nursing procedures in both conscious (n.41) and unconscious (n.60) patients; furthermore, VAS was recorded when possible in conscious patients only. We calculated criterion and discriminant validity to both scales (Wilcoxon, Spearman rank correlation coefficients). The accuracy of individual scales was evaluated. The sensitivity and the specificity of CPOT and BPS scores were assessed. Kappa coefficients with the quadratic weight were used to reflect agreement between the two scales, and we calculated the effect size to identify the strength of a phenomenon.\nRESULTS: CPOT and BPS showed a good criterion and discriminant validity (p\u2009&lt;\u20090.0001). BPS was found to be more specific (91.7 %) than CPOT (70.8 %), but less sensitive (BPS 62.7 %, CPOT 76.5 %). COPT and BPS scores were significantly correlated with VAS (p\u2009&lt;\u20090.0001). The combination of BPS and CPOT resulted in better sensitivity 80.4 %. Facial expression was the main parameter to determine pain scales changes effect size\u2009=\u20091.4.\nCONCLUSIONS: In critically ill mechanically ventilated patients, both CPOT and BPS can be used for assessment of pain intensity with different sensitivity and specificity.

Patients received 200 mg intravenous pembrolizumab once every 3 weeks plus 20 mg oral lenvatinib once per day for up to 2 years or until disease progression, development of unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent. The primary endpoint was objective response rate identified by a local investigator according to mRECIST version 1.1. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04287829, and is recruiting for the second cohort.\nFINDINGS: Between March 5, 2021, and Jan 31, 2022, 42 patients were screened, of whom 38 were included in the primary endpoint and safety analyses (median age 71 years [IQR 65-75], 33 [87%] male and five [13%] female) . At data cutoff (Jan 31, 2023), with a median follow-up of 17\u00b77 months (IQR 13\u00b78-19\u00b74), 22 (58%; 95% CI 41-74) of 38 patients had an objective response. The independent review showed an objective response in 17 (45%; 95% CI 29-62) of 38 patients. Serious treatment-related adverse events occurred in ten (26%) patients, including one treatment-related death due to myocardial infarction. The most common treatment-related grade 3 or worse adverse events were hypertension (eight patients [21%]) and anorexia and lymphopenia (both four patients [11%]). In 29 (76%) of 38 patients, at least one dose reduction or discontinuation of lenvatinib was required.\nINTERPRETATION: Pembrolizumab plus lenvatinib showed promising anti-tumour activity in patients with pleural mesothelioma with considerable toxicity, similar to that in previous studies. Available evidence from the literature suggests a high starting dose of lenvatinib for optimal anti-tumour activity. This, however, demands a high standard of supportive care.

This can contribute to disease through increasing carcinogenic metabolite/toxin production, inducing inflammation, and activating oncogenic signaling. To limit disease progression, external factors that may influence the colonic microbiota need to be considered in patients with colorectal cancer. One major factor that can influence the colonic microbiota is iron. Iron is an essential micronutrient that is required by both prokaryotes and eukaryotes for cellular function. Most pathogenic bacteria have heightened iron acquisition mechanisms and therefore tend to outcompete protective bacteria for free iron. Colorectal cancer patients often present with anemia due to iron deficiency, and thus they require iron therapy. Depending upon the route of administration, iron therapy has the potential to contribute to a procarciongenic microbiota. Orally administered iron is the common treatment for anemia in these patients but can lead to an increased gut iron concentration. This suggests the need to reassess the route of iron therapy in these patients. Currently, this has only been assessed in murine studies, with human trials being necessary to unravel the potential microbial outcomes of iron therapy.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24071482": "The host and microbiota have evolved mechanisms for coexistence over millions of years.

Many recent studies have attempted to define links between microbiota residents, their function and the development of colorectal cancer (CRC). Gut microbiota drive the development of inflammation within the colon and such inflammation is implicated in colonic neoplastic development. Although the precise mechanisms through which the microbiota is involved in cancer development remain elusive, the message is clear: the microbiota contributes to cancer risk by influencing a number of key host processes. It is also recognized that we have the ability to influence the role of the gut microbiota by considering our nutritional intake. We have always known that 'we are what we eat' but it is also true that 'they (our gut microbiota) are what we eat'. We therefore have a huge opportunity to positively influence our health through microbial manipulation. There is now a clear need to move past defining the constituents of the gastrointestinal microbiota and to focus more on understanding the functional capabilities of the resident microbial community and how this impacts on host health. One such emerging concept is the development of microbial biofilms which can form in the gut in conjunction with CRC tissue.

The rats were later submitted to 2-acetylaminofluorene treatment and partial hepatectomy, and placental glutathione S-transferase-positive liver foci were detected and quantified. The in vivo effects of carotenoids or of 3-MC on AFB1-induced liver DNA damage were evaluated using different endpoints: liver DNA single-strand breaks (SSB) induced by AFB1, and in vivo binding of [3H]AFB1 to liver DNA and plasma albumin. Finally, the modulation of AFB1 metabolism by carotenoids or by 3-MC was investigated in vitro by incubating [14C]AFB1 with liver microsomes from rats that had been fed with carotenoids or treated by 3-MC, and the metabolites formed by HPLC were analyzed. In contrast to lycopene or to an excess of vitamin A, both of which had no effect, beta-carotene, beta-apo-8'carotenal, astaxanthin and canthaxanthin, as well as 3-MC, were very efficient in reducing the number and the size of liver preneoplastic foci. In a similar way as 3-MC, the P4501A-inducer carotenoids, beta-apo-8'-carotenal astaxanthin and canthaxanthin, decreased in vivo AFB1-induced DNA SSB and the binding of AFB1 to liver DNA and plasma albumin, and increased in vitro AFB1 metabolism to aflatoxin M1, a less genotoxic metabolite. It is concluded that these carotenoids exert their protective effect through the deviation of AFB1 metabolism towards detoxication pathways.

Three indirect adherence measures were obtained at week 48: medication possession ratio (MPR), pill count and self-report (30-days recall). Tenofovir diphosphate (TFV-DP) concentration in Dried Blood Spot (DBS) was measured at week 48. Areas under (AUC) the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve were used to evaluate the concordance between achieving protective drug levels (TFV-DP\u2265700fmol/punch) and the indirect adherence measures. Youden's index and distance to corner were used to determine the optimal cutoff points for each indirect adherence measure. We calculated sensitivity, specificity, negative (NPV) and positive (PPV) predictive values for the found cutoff points. Finally, Delong test was used to compare AUCs.\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION: From April, 2014 to July, 2016, 450 participants initiated PrEP, 375(83.3%) were retained through 48 weeks. Of these, 74% (277/375) had TFV-DP \u2265700fmol/punch. All adherence measures discriminated between participants with and without protective drug levels (AUC>0.5). High indirect adherence measure was predictive of protective drug levels (PPV>0.8) while low indirect adherence measure was not predictive of lack of protective drug levels (NPV<0.5).

As such, genetically determined mitochondrial diseases may result from a molecular defect involving the mitochondrial or the nuclear genome. The first is characterized by maternal inheritance and the second by Mendelian inheritance. Ragged-red fibers (RRF) are commonly seen with primary lesions of mtDNA, but this association is not invariant. Conversely, RRF are seldom associated with primary lesions of nuclear DNA. Large-scale rearrangements (deletions and insertions) and point mutations of mtDNA are commonly associated with RRF and lactic acidosis, e.g. Kearns-Sayre syndrome (KSS) (major large-scale rearrangements), Pearson syndrome (large-scale rearrangements), myoclonus epilepsy with RRF (MERRF) (point mutation affecting tRNA(lys) gene), mitochondrial myopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) (two point mutations affecting tRNA(leu)(UUR) gene) and a maternally-inherited myopathy with cardiac involvement (MIMyCa) (point mutation affecting tRNA(leu)(UUR) gene). However, RRF and lactic acidosis are absent in Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) (one point mutation affecting ND4 gene, two point mutations affecting ND1 gene, and one point mutation affecting the apocytochrome b subunit of complex III), and the condition associated with maternally inherited sensory neuropathy (N), ataxia (A), retinitis pigmentosa (RP), developmental delay, dementia, seizures, and limb weakness (NARP) (point mutation affecting ATPase subunit 6 gene). The point mutations in MELAS, MIMyCa, and MERRF, and the large-scale mtDNA rearrangements in KSS and Pearson syndrome have a broader biochemical impact since these molecular defects involve the translational sequence of mitochondrial protein synthesis. The nuclear defects involving mitochondrial function generally are not associated with RRF. The biochemical classification of mitochondrial diseases principally catalogues these nuclear defects. This classification divides mitochondrial diseases into five categories. Primary and secondary deficiencies of carnitine are examples of a substrate transport defect. A lipid storage myopathy is often present. Disturbances of pyruvate or fatty acid metabolism are examples of substrate utilization defects. Only four defects of the Krebs cycle are known: fumarase deficiency, dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase deficiency, alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase deficiency, and combined defects of muscle succinate dehydrogenase and aconitase. Luft disease is the singular example of a defect in oxidation-phosphorylation coupling. Defects of respiratory chain function are manifold. Two clinical syndromes predominate, one involving limb weakness, and the other primarily affecting brain function. Leigh syndrome may result from different enzyme defects, most notably pyruvate dehydrogenase complex deficiency, cytochrome c oxidase deficiency, complex I deficiency, and complex V deficiency associated with the recently described NARP point mutation. A new group of mitochondrial diseases has emerged.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10443880": "Mutations of SURF-1, a gene located on chromosome 9q34, have recently been identified in patients affected by Leigh syndrome (LS), associated with deficiency of cytochrome c oxidase (COX), the terminal component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. To investigate to what extent SURF-1 is responsible for human disorders because of COX deficiency, we undertook sequence analysis of the SURF-1 gene in 46 unrelated patients. We analyzed 24 COX-defective patients classified as having typical Leigh syndrome (LS(COX)), 6 patients classified as Leigh-like (LL(COX)) cases, and 16 patients classified as non-LS(COX) cases. Frameshift, stop, and splice mutations of SURF-1 were detected in 18 of 24 (75%) of the LS(COX) cases. No mutations were found in the LL(COX) and non-LS(COX) group of patients. Rescue of the COX phenotype was observed in transfected cells from patients harboring SURF-1 mutations, but not in transfected cell lines from 2 patients in whom no mutations were detected by sequence analysis. Loss of function of SURF-1 protein is specifically associated with LS(COX), although a proportion of LS(COX) cases must be the result of abnormalities in genes other than SURF-1. SURF-1 is the first nuclear gene to be consistently mutated in a major category of respiratory chain defects. DNA analysis can now be used to accurately diagnose LS(COX), a common subtype of Leigh syndrome.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36237717": "Leigh syndrome or subacute necrotizing encephalomyelopathy is a rare, rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disorder. In general, symptoms such as shortness of breath and decreased cardiac function usually occur within 1 year of life. It is a serious disease with a mortality rate of 75% in 2-3 years. The cause of Leigh syndrome is DNA mutation. Approximately 75% of patients have nuclear DNA mutations while 25% have mitochondrial DNA mutations. Clinical symptoms vary depending on the affected brain area. Neuroimaging plays an important role in diagnosing patients with Leigh syndrome. Late-onset Leigh syndrome is rarer and progresses more slowly compared to the classic form. Here, we report a case of late-onset Leigh's syndrome mimicking Wernicke's encephalopathy.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35217561": "Variants in the mitochondrial genome can result in dysfunction of Complex I within the electron transport chain, thus causing disruptions in oxidative phosphorylation. Pathogenic variants in the MT-ND1 (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase core subunit 1) gene that result in Complex I dysfunction are a known cause of Leigh syndrome. The patient is a 4-yr-old female who initially presented with generalized tonic-clonic seizures, with other symptoms of Leigh syndrome becoming apparent after the seizures. A three-generation pedigree revealed no family history of mitochondrial disorders. Laboratory studies were remarkable for elevated blood lactate, alanine, and GDF15. T<sub>2</sub>-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed bilateral asymmetric signal hyperintensities in the basal ganglia, specifically in the bilateral putamen and right caudate. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy showed regionally elevated glucose and lactate. Mitochondrial respiratory chain enzyme analysis on skin fibroblasts demonstrated slightly reduced Complex I function. A 16-gene dystonia panel and chromosomal microarray analysis did not identify any disease-causing variants. Combined exome and mitochondrial genome sequencing identified the m.3685T &gt; C (MT-ND1 p.Tyr127His) variant with 62.3% heteroplasmy with no alternative cause for the patient's condition. Mitochondrial genome sequencing of the mother demonstrated that the m.3685T &gt; C variant occurred de novo. The m.3685T &gt; C variant is absent from population databases. The tyrosine 127 residue is highly conserved, and several nearby pathogenic variants in the MT-ND1 gene have been previously associated with Leigh syndrome. We propose that the m.3685T &gt; C variant is a novel mitochondrial DNA variant that causes Leigh syndrome, and we classify this variant as likely pathogenic based on currently available information.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35166475": "Primary melanocytic tumors of the central nervous system (CNS) are extremely rare and account for only 1% of all melanomas and 0.05% of primary brain tumors.

Cranial magnetic resonance imaging showed obvious brain atrophy with bilateral extensive meningeal enhancement in the supratentorial region. Diffusion-weighted imaging and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery showed slightly hyperintensive signals in the cortex. Microscopic examination revealed invasion of pigment into the Virchow-Robin space and cortex. Immunohistochemical examination of biopsy samples showed that cells were immunopositive for HMB45 and S-100 and immunonegative for melan-A with a Ki-67-positive percentage of 3%. No obvious atypia or nuclear mitosis was observed. Pathohistologic results of biopsied meninges confirmed the diagnosis of diffuse meningeal melanomatosis.

We sought to\u00a0determine the contribution of differences in insurance, comorbidities, tumor characteristics, and treatment receipt to disparities in black vs white patients with CRC 18-64 years old.\nMETHODS: We used data from the National Cancer Database, a hospital-based cancer registry database sponsored by the American College of Surgeons and the American Cancer\u00a0Society, on non-Hispanic black (black) and non-Hispanic white (white) patients, 18-64 years old, diagnosed from 2004 through 2012 with single or first primary invasive stage I-IV CRC. Each black patient was matched, based on demographic, insurance, comorbidity, tumor, and treatment features, with 5 white patients, from partially overlapping subgroups, using propensity score and greedy matching algorithms. We used the\u00a0Kaplan-Meier method to estimate 5-year survival and Cox\u00a0proportional hazards models to generate hazard ratios.\nRESULTS: The absolute 5-year survival difference between black and white unmatched patients with CRC was 9.2% (57.3% for black patients vs 66.5% for\u00a0white patients; P\u00a0<\u00a0.0001). The absolute difference in survival did not change after patient groups were matched for demographics, but decreased to 4.9% (47% relative decrease [4.3% of 9.2%]) when they were matched for insurance and to\u00a02.3% when they were matched for tumor characteristics (26% relative decrease [2.4% of 9.2%]). Further matching by treatment did not reduce\u00a0the difference in 5-year survival between black and white patients. In proportional hazards model, insurance and\u00a0tumor characteristics matching accounted for the 54% and 27% excess risk of death in black patients, respectively.\nCONCLUSIONS: In an analysis of data\u00a0from the National Cancer Database, we found that insurance coverage differences accounted for approximately one half of the disparity in survival rate of black vs white patients with CRC, 18-64 years old; tumor characteristics accounted for a quarter of the disparity. Affordable health insurance coverage for all populations could substantially reduce differences in survival times of black vs white patients with CRC.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24231453": "BACKGROUND: Black patients with metastatic colorectal cancer have inferior survival compared to white patients. The purpose of this study was to examine disparity in specialist consultation and multimodality treatment and the impact that treatment inequality has on survival.\nMETHODS: We identified 9935 non-Hispanic white and 1281 black patients with stage IV colorectal cancer aged 66 years and older from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare linked database. Logistic regression models identified race-based differences in consultation rates and subsequent treatment with surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation. Multivariable Cox regression models identified potential factors that explain race-based survival differences. All statistical tests were two-sided.\nRESULTS: Black patients had lower rates of consultation with surgery, medical oncology, and radiation oncology. Among patients seen in consultation, black patients received less surgery directed at the primary tumor, liver- or lung-directed surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. Unadjusted survival analysis found a 15% higher chance of dying for black patients compared with white patients (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.15; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.08 to 1.22; P < .001). Adjustment for patient, tumor, and demographic variables marginally reduced the risk of death (HR = 1.08; 95% CI = 1.01 to 1.15; P = .03). After adjustment for differences in treatment, the increased risk of death for black patients disappeared.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our study shows racial disparity in specialist consultation as well as subsequent treatment with multimodality therapy for metastatic colorectal cancer, and it suggests that inferior survival for black patients may stem from this treatment disparity.

Whites are more likely to adhere to screening guidelines. This is also the case among people with positive family history. Colorectal cancer is more frequent in Blacks. Studies have shown that that since 1985, colon cancer rates have dipped 20% to 25% for Whites, while rates have gone up for African-American men and stayed the same for African-American women. Overall, African-Americans are 38% to 43% more likely to die from colon cancer than are Whites. Furthermore, it seems that there is an African-American predominance in right-sited tumors. African Americans tend to be diagnosed at a later stage, to suffer from better differentiated tumors, and to have worse prognosis when compared with Whites. Moreover, less black patients receive adjuvant chemotherapy for resectable colorectal cancer or radiation therapy for rectal cancer. Caucasians seem to respond better to standard chemotherapy regimens than African-Americans. Concerning toxicity, it appears that patients of African-American descent are more likely to develop 5-FU toxicity than Whites, possibly because of their different dihydropyridine dehydrogenase status. Last but not least, screening surveillance seems to be higher among white than among black long-term colorectal cancer survivors. Socioeconomic and educational status account for most of these differences whereas little evidence exists for a genetic contribution in racial disparity. Understanding the nature of racial differences in colorectal cancer allows tailoring of screening and treatment interventions.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35176030": "BACKGROUND: Black patients and underinsured patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) present with more advanced disease and experience worse outcomes. The study aim was to evaluate the interaction of health insurance status and race with treatment and survival in metastatic CRC.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients diagnosed with metastatic CRC within NCDB from 2006-2016 were included. Primary outcomes included receipt of chemotherapy and 3-year all-cause mortality. Multivariable logistic regression and Cox-regression (MVR) including a two-way interaction term of race and insurance were performed to evaluate the differential association of race and insurance with receipt of chemotherapy and mortality, respectively.\nRESULTS: 128,031 patients were identified; 70.6% White, 14.4% Black, 5.7% Hispanic, and 9.3% Other race. Chemotherapy use was higher among White compared to Black patients. 3-year mortality rate was higher for Blacks and lower for Hispanics, in comparison with White patients. By MVR, Black patients were less likely to receive chemotherapy. When stratified by insurance status, Black patients with private and Medicare insurance were less likely to receive chemotherapy than White patients. All-cause mortality was higher in Black patients and lower in Hispanic patients, and these differences persisted after controlling for insurance and receipt of chemotherapy.\nCONCLUSION: Black patients and uninsured or under-insured patients with metastatic CRC are less likely to receive chemotherapy and have increased mortality.

Relatively few reports consider these mechanisms of colorectal cancer development across racial or ethnic groups. Available data indicate a moderate increase in colorectal cancer risk among Ashkenazi Jews who have a mutational polymorphism at codon 1307 in the APC gene. In American blacks, there is evidence for a higher prevalence of right-sided colonic tumors and an earlier age of onset of colorectal cancer. In addition, blacks have the highest colon cancer incidence in the United States among ethnic groups and have poorer 5-year survival rates compared with whites. While some differences may be attributed to health care access and socioeconomic differences, these do not completely explain all the variances. In the chromosomal instability pathway, there are polymorphisms within the P53 gene that are more prevalent in blacks, but the significance of these polymorphisms is not fully known. Blacks are more likely to demonstrate micro-satellite instability in their tumors; however, the mechanism for this phenomenon in blacks is unexplored. Differences in diet among racial and ethnic groups and polymorphic variations in drug metabolizing or acetylation genes have not been adequately cataloged.

Curcumin, as a traditional Chinese medicine extract with anti-tumor and anti-inflammatory effects, can affect the development of diverse human diseases including cancer. The aim of this research was to probe the mechanism by which curcumin regulates colon cancer progression. Colon cancer cells were processed with graded concentrations of curcumin. The proliferation and apoptosis of the treated cells were determined by MTT, colony formation assay and flow cytometry. Expression of signaling pathway-related proteins and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) was measured by western blotting. The effect of curcumin on tumor cell growth was verified through T cell-mediated killing and ELISA assays. The relationship between target gene expression and the survival rate of colon cancer patients was analyzed by a survival curve. Curcumin treatment restrained proliferation and accelerated apoptosis of colon cancer cells. It elevated miR-206 expression, which in turn affected colon cancer cell function. miR-206 enhanced colon cancer cell apoptosis and inhibited PD-L1 expression; thus, curcumin enhanced the killing effect of T cells on tumor cells by suppressing PD-L1 through inhibiting the JAK/STAT3 pathway. Patients with high expression of miR-206 had better survival rates than those with low expression. Curcumin can regulate miR-206 expression and inhibit the malignant behavior of colon cancer cells and enhance T cell killing through the JAK/STAT3 pathway.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36986483": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. The limitations of current chemotherapeutic drugs in CRC include their toxicity, side effects, and exorbitant costs. To assess these unmet needs in CRC treatment, several naturally occurring compounds, including curcumin and andrographis, have gained increasing attention due to their multi-targeted functionality and safety vs. conventional drugs. In the current study, we revealed that a combination of curcumin and andrographis exhibited superior anti-tumor effects by inhibiting cell proliferation, invasion, colony formation, and inducing apoptosis. Genome-wide transcriptomic expression profiling analysis revealed that curcumin and andrographis activated the ferroptosis pathway. Moreover, we confirmed the gene and protein expression of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX-4) and ferroptosis suppressor protein 1 (FSP-1), the two major negative regulators of ferroptosis, were downregulated by this combined treatment. With this regimen, we also observed that intracellular accumulation of reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxides were induced in CRC cells. These cell line findings were validated in patient-derived organoids. In conclusion, our study revealed that combined treatment with curcumin and andrographis exhibited anti-tumorigenic effects in CRC cells through activation of ferroptosis and by dual suppression of GPX-4 and FSP-1, which have significant potential implications for the adjunctive treatment of CRC patients.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37333486": "Curcumin is the most abundant derivative of turmeric rhizome. Although studies have proved that curcumin could inhibit the growth of tumors, its specific molecular mechanism has not yet been fully elucidated. This study aims to systematically elaborate the mechanisms of curcumin against hepatocellular carcinoma. The anti-tumor effect of curcumin was determined by the cell viability test. Flow cytometry was applied to examine the cell cycle and the apoptosis of cancer cells, and the cancer cell migration was detected by wound healing experiments. The expressions of signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) in cancer cells were examined by immunostaining and analyzed by the Image J analysis system. After treatment with curcumin, the apoptosis ratio of HepG2 cells increased significantly (P &lt; 0.05). The proliferation of cancer cells was arrested at the S-phase cell cycle, and the migration of cancer cells was inhibited by the increasing concentration of curcumin, together with the decreasing expressions of STAT3, VEGF, and HIF-1\u03b1 signaling pathways. The results indicate that curcumin could effectively inhibit the growth and migration of hepatocarcinoma cells by inducing cancer cell apoptosis, blocking the cancer cell cycle in the S phase, and reducing the expression of STAT3, VEGF, and HIF-1\u03b1 signaling pathways.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37210578": "Curcumin, a natural phytochemical isolated from tumeric roots, represents a candidate for prevention and therapy of colorectal cancer/CRC. However, the exact mechanism of action and the downstream mediators of curcumin's tumor suppressive effects have remained largely unknown. Here we used a genetic approach to determine the role of the p53/miR-34 pathway as mediator of the effects of curcumin. Three isogenic CRC cell lines rendered deficient for the p53, miR-34a and/or miR-34b/c genes were exposed to curcumin and subjected to cell biological analyses. siRNA-mediated inhibition and ectopic expression of NRF2, as well as Western blot, qPCR and qChIP analyses of its target genes were performed. CRC cells were i.v. injected into NOD/SCID mice and lung-metastases formation was determined by longitudinal, non-invasive imaging. In CRC cells curcumin induced apoptosis and senescence, and suppressed migration and invasion in a p53-independent manner. Curcumin activated the KEAP1/NRF2/ARE pathway by inducing ROS. Notably, curcumin induced miR-34a and miR-34b/c expression in a ROS/NRF2-dependent and p53-independent manner. NRF2 directly induced miR-34a and miR-34b/c via occupying multiple ARE motifs in their promoter regions. Curcumin reverted repression of miR-34a and miR-34b/c induced by IL6 and hypoxia. Deletion of miR-34a and miR-34b/c significantly reduced curcumin-induced apoptosis and senescence, and prevented the inhibition of migration and invasion by curcumin or ectopic NRF2. In CRC cells curcumin induced MET and prevented the formation of lung-metastases in mice in a miR-34a-dependent manner. In addition, we found that curcumin may enhance the therapeutic effects of 5-FU on CRC cells deficient for p53 and miR-34a/b/c. Activation of the KEAP1/NRF2/miR-34a/b/c axis mediates the tumor suppressive activity of curcumin and suggests a new approach for activating miR-34 genes in tumors for therapeutic purposes.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20426658": "The effectiveness of lung radiotherapy is limited by radiation tolerance of normal tissues and by the intrinsic radiosensitivity of lung cancer cells. The chemopreventive agent curcumin has known antioxidant and tumor cell radiosensitizing properties. Its usefulness in preventing radiation-induced pneumonopathy has not been tested previously. We evaluated dietary curcumin in radiation-induced pneumonopathy and lung tumor regression in a murine model. Mice were given 1% or 5% (w/w) dietary curcumin or control diet prior to irradiation and for the duration of the experiment. Lungs were evaluated at 3 weeks after irradiation for acute lung injury and inflammation by evaluating bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid content for proteins, neutrophils and at 4 months for pulmonary fibrosis. In a separate series of experiments, an orthotopic model of lung cancer using intravenously injected Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells was used to exclude possible tumor radioprotection by dietary curcumin. In vitro, curcumin boosted antioxidant defenses by increasing heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) levels in primary lung endothelial and fibroblast cells and blocked radiation-induced generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Dietary curcumin significantly increased HO-1 in lungs as early as after 1 week of feeding, coinciding with a steady-state level of curcumin in plasma. Although both 1% and 5% w/w dietary curcumin exerted physiological changes in lung tissues by significantly decreasing LPS-induced TNF-alpha production in lungs, only 5% dietary curcumin significantly improved survival of mice after irradiation and decreased radiation-induced lung fibrosis. Importantly, dietary curcumin did not protect LLC pulmonary metastases from radiation killing. Thus dietary curcumin ameliorates radiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis and increases mouse survival while not impairing tumor cell killing by radiation.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36564597": "PURPOSE: To investigate the long-term outcomes of cataract surgery for glaucoma management in patients with primary angle-closure disease (PACD).\nSTUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case series.\nMETHODS: We reviewed the medical records of 87 eyes of 87 patients with PACD who underwent uncomplicated cataract surgery alone at the Kobe City Medical Center General Hospital. Only patients with a minimum follow-up of 10 years were included. The patients were divided into PACD spectrum categories: primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG), primary-angle closure (PAC), and primary angle-closure suspect (PACS). The treatment outcomes were compared among the 3 groups. Intraocular pressure (IOP), number of glaucoma eye drops, requirement of additional glaucoma treatment, visual field progression, and progression to glaucoma during the follow-up period were evaluated.\nRESULTS: Among the 87 patients, 39 had PACG; 26, PAC; and 22, PACS. Ten years after surgery, the IOP had significantly decreased from baseline in all 3 groups. The rate of requirement of additional glaucoma treatment during the follow-up period was significantly higher in the PACG group than in the other groups. Almost half of the patients with PACG required additional glaucoma treatment; of those patients, six (15.4%) underwent glaucoma surgery. Three patients (11.5%) with PAC required additional glaucoma medication. Visual field progression was observed in 28.1% of the patients with PACG. In 1 patient with PAC, the condition progressed to PACG, but there was no such progression in any of the patients with PACS.\nCONCLUSIONS: We confirmed that cataract surgery had a long-term (>\u00a010 years) effect on IOP reduction in eyes with PACD.

Data included sex, age, laterality, type of glaucoma, cyclodiode parameters, number of glaucoma medications, visual acuity and treatment with acetazolamide. Data were analysed using generalised linear modelling and Kaplan-Meier analysis.\nRESULTS: A total of 54 eyes in 54 patients (29 M:25F) with a mean age of 66\u2009years (range 15-85\u2009years) with a minimum of 5\u2009years follow up were included. The mean number of burns was 23.3 (range 12-40) over 180-270 degrees, mean power per burn was 1967\u2009mW (range 1500-2000\u2009mW), with a mean duration of 1981\u2009ms (1500-2000\u2009ms). The mean pre-treatment IOP was 31.5\u2009mmHg (range 17-56\u2009mmHg) and mean IOP 5\u2009years post-treatment was 16.1\u2009mmHg (2-42\u2009mmHg).

Many patients with glaucoma are asymptomatic early in the disease course. Primary care clinicians should know which patients to refer to an eye care professional for a complete eye examination to check for signs of glaucoma and to determine what systemic conditions or medications can increase a patient's risk of glaucoma. Open-angle and narrow-angle forms of glaucoma are reviewed, including a description of the pathophysiology, risk factors, screening, disease monitoring, and treatment options.\nOBSERVATIONS: Glaucoma is a chronic progressive optic neuropathy, characterized by damage to the optic nerve and retinal nerve fiber layer, that can lead to permanent loss of peripheral or central vision. Intraocular pressure is the only known modifiable risk factor. Other important risk factors include older age, nonwhite race, and a family history of glaucoma. Several systemic medical conditions and medications including corticosteroids, anticholinergics, certain antidepressants, and topiramate may predispose patients to glaucoma. There are 2 broad categories of glaucoma, open-angle and angle-closure glaucoma. Diagnostic testing to assess for glaucoma and to monitor for disease progression includes measurement of intraocular pressure, perimetry, and optical coherence tomography. Treatment of glaucoma involves lowering intraocular pressure. This can be achieved with various classes of glaucoma medications as well as laser and incisional surgical procedures.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Vision loss from glaucoma can be minimized by recognizing systemic conditions and medications that increase a patient's risk of glaucoma and referring high-risk patients for a complete ophthalmologic examination. Clinicians should ensure that patients remain adherent with taking glaucoma medications and should monitor for adverse events from medical or surgical interventions used to treat glaucoma.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35647957": "The burden of irreversible vision loss from Glaucoma continues to rise. While the disease pathogenesis is not well understood, intraocular pressure (IOP) is the only modifiable risk factor identified to prevent glaucomatous vision loss. Medical management remains the first-line of treatment in most adult glaucomas and the evolution of medical therapy for glaucoma has followed an exponential curve. This review tracks the rapid development of new medications and drug delivery systems in the recent years. Introduction of Rho kinase inhibitors with an entirely new mechanism of action from that of the currently used anti glaucoma medications has been a significant milestone. Latanoprostene Bunod is a novel, single molecule which provides two active metabolites that work through two different pathways for reducing intra ocular pressure. Bimatoprost implants and travoprost punctum plugs attempt to ease chronic medication use in glaucoma patients. Nanotechnology is an evolving route of drug delivery. Role of cannabinoids in medical management of glaucoma remain equivocal. The relatively short term effect on IOP, the risks of developing tolerance and side effects impacting patients' neurocognitive health greatly outweigh the potential benefit. Research on Latrunculin B, Adenosine receptor agonists, Specific gene silencing and Stem cell therapy are poised to make an impact on glaucoma treatment.

Although the follow-up of glaucoma patients with single IOP measurements is quick and convenient, such measurements often do not adequately reflect the untreated IOP characteristics, or indeed the quality of treated IOP control during the 24-h cycle. Since glaucoma is a 24-h disease and the damaging effect of elevated IOP is continuous, it is logical that we should aim to understand the efficacy of all treatment options throughout the 24-h period. This article first reviews the concept and value of diurnal and 24-h IOP monitoring. It then critically evaluates selected available evidence on the 24-h efficacy of medical, laser and surgical therapy options. During the past decade several controlled trials have significantly enhanced our understanding on the 24-h efficacy of all glaucoma therapy options. Nevertheless, more long-term evidence is needed to better evaluate the 24-h efficacy of glaucoma therapy and the precise impact of IOP characteristics on glaucomatous progression and visual prognosis.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37355760": "Pegozafermin, a long-acting glycopegylated analog of human fibroblast growth factor 21, is in development for the treatment of severe hypertriglyceridemia (SHTG) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.

In a phase Ib/IIa placebo-controlled, double-blind, multiple ascending dose study in patients with NASH (NCT04048135), administration of pegozafermin resulted in clinically meaningful reductions in hepatic fat fraction (HFF), with a favorable safety and tolerability profile. We aimed to characterize the relationship between pegozafermin dosing, exposure and effects on HFF reduction. We used pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) modeling of data from the phase Ib/IIa study to identify model parameters and covariates affecting the exposure-response relationship. Clinical simulations were performed to help support dose selection for larger studies. Pegozafermin exposure was adequately described by a one compartment PK model, with one additional transit absorption compartment. PK/PD modeling demonstrated that HFF reduction was significantly related to pegozafermin exposure. HFF outcomes were correlated with average pegozafermin concentrations regardless of weekly dosing (q.w.) or dosing every 2\u2009weeks (q2w). The significant PK/PD model covariates included baseline body weight, alanine aminotransferase level, and liver volume. Simulations showed that the 30\u2009mg q.w. dose approximated the full PD effect; almost all patients would benefit from a greater than or equal to 30% HFF reduction, suggesting fibrosis regression. Furthermore, 44\u2009mg q2w dosing (~22\u2009mg q.w.) appeared to be an effective regimen for HFF reduction.

In diabetic monkeys, once-weekly and once-every-2-weeks regimens of subcutaneous pegozafermin provided rapid and robust benefits for an array of metabolic biomarkers, including triglycerides, cholesterol, fasting glucose, glycated hemoglobin, adiponectin, alanine aminotransferase, food intake, and body weight. In a single ascending dose study in healthy volunteers, subcutaneously administered pegozafermin was associated with statistically significant improvements in triglycerides, low- and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, and adiponectin, an insulin-sensitizing and anti-inflammatory adipokine. Pharmacokinetic half-lives ranged from 55 to 100 hours over the clinically relevant dose range, consistent with the expected half-life extension by glycoPEGylation.

Studies presented here demonstrate that a novel long-acting FGF21 analog, pegozafermin, has similar pharmacologic properties as FGF21 and that repeated, subcutaneous dosing of pegozafermin in diabetic monkeys and healthy humans improves lipid metabolism, glucose metabolism, weight, and liver transaminases.

The effects of PCSK9 antibodies on triglyceride metabolism are less pronounced. The present study aimed to investigate in detail the effects of alirocumab on triglycerides, triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, and lipase regulators.\nMETHODS: A total of 24 patients with an indication for treatment with PCSK9 antibodies were recruited. There were two visits at the study site: the first before initiation of treatment with alirocumab and the second after 10 weeks of treatment. Fat-tolerance tests, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were performed to analyze lipid metabolism.\nRESULTS: A total of 21 participants underwent the first and second investigation. Among these, two participants only received alirocumab twice and 19 patients completed the trial per protocol. All of them had atherosclerotic vascular disease. There was no significant effect of alirocumab treatment on fasting triglycerides, post-prandial triglycerides, or lipoprotein-lipase regulating proteins.

The aim of this work was to develop an integrated pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic model to describe the interaction of alirocumab with PCSK9 and its impact on the evolution of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels and explore labeling specification for subpopulations.\nMETHODS: Using data collected from nine phase I/II/III clinical studies (n\u00a0=\u00a0527, subcutaneous or intravenous administration), a TMDD model considering the quasi-steady-state approximation was developed to characterize the interaction dynamics of alirocumab and PCSK9, combined with an indirect pharmacodynamic model describing the inhibition of LDL-C by PCSK9 in a one-step approach using nonlinear-mixed effects modeling. A \"full fixed effects modeling\" strategy was implemented to quantify parameter-covariate relationships.\nRESULTS: The model captures the interaction between alirocumab and its target PCSK9 and how this mechanism drives LDL-C depletion, with an estimation of the associated between-subject variability of model parameters and the quantification of clinically relevant parameter-covariate relationships. Co-administration of statins was found to increase the central volume of distribution of alirocumab by 1.75-fold (5.6\u00a0L versus 3.2\u00a0L) and allow for a 14% greater maximum lipid-lowering effect (88% versus 74%), highlighting the synergy of action between anti-PCSK9 therapeutic antibodies and statins toward lowering LDL-C plasma levels. Baseline levels of PCSK9 were found to be related to the amplitude of LDL-C variations by increasing the concentration of free PCSK9 necessary to reach half its capacity of inhibition of LDL-C degradation.\nCONCLUSION: The maximum effect of alirocumab is achieved when free PCSK9 concentration is close to zero, as seen mostly after 150\u00a0mg every 2\u00a0weeks (Q2W) or 300 mg every 4\u00a0weeks (Q4W), indicating that there would be no additional clinical benefit of increasing the dose higher than these recommended dosing regimens.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37018869": "The gram-negative bacterium Helicobacter pylori is the most common chronic bacterial infection and the main cause of gastric cancer.

The elimination of H. pylori is currently considered one of the most effective strategies for the treatment of gastric-related diseases, so antibiotic therapy is the most commonly used regimen for the treatment of H. pylori infection. Although this therapy has some positive effects, antibiotic resistance has become another clinically prominent problem. Therefore, the development of a safe and efficient vaccine has become an important measure to prevent H. pylori infection.\nMETHODS: PubMed and ClinicalTrials.gov were systematically searched from January 1980 to March 2023 with search terms-H. pylori vaccine, adjuvants, immunization, pathogenesis, and H. pylori eradication in the title and/or abstract of literature. A total of 5182 documents were obtained. Based on the principles of academic reliability, authority, nearly publicated, and excluded the similar documents, finally, 75 documents were selected, organized, and analyzed.\nRESULTS: Most of the candidate antigens used as H. pylori vaccines in these literatures are whole-cell antigens and virulence antigens such as UreB, VacA, CagA, and HspA, and the main types of vaccines for H. pylori are whole bacteria vaccines, vector vaccines, subunit vaccines, nucleic acid vaccines, epitope vaccines, etc. Some vaccines have shown good immune protection in animal trials; however, few vaccines show good in clinical trials.

The colonization of the stomach\u0301s gastric mucosa by H. pylori is related to the onset of chronic gastritis, peptic ulcer, and cancer. The estimated deaths from gastric cancer caused by this bacterial infection are in the 15,000-150,000 range. Current treatment for controlling the colonization of H. pylori includes the administration of two to four antibiotics and a gastric ATPase proton pump inhibitor. Nevertheless, the bacterium has shown increased resistance to antibiotics. Despite an extensive list of attempts to develop a vaccine, no approved vaccine against H. pylori is available.

We verified the expression of this hybrid multiepitopic protein in HeLa cells. Mice were inoculated with the recombinant baculovirus Bac-Thp1 using various administration routes: intranasal, intragastric, intramuscular, and a combination of intranasal and intragastric. We identified a strong adjuvant-independent IgG-antibody response in the serum of recombinant baculovirus-Thp1 inoculated mice, which was specific for a strain of H. pylori isolated from a human patient. The bacterium-specific IgG-antibodies were present in sera 125\u00a0days after the first vaccine administration. Also, H. pylori-specific IgA-antibodies were found in feces at 82\u00a0days after the first inoculation.

It is now recognized that H pylori is a chronic infection of the stomach causing inflammation.

However, the role of H pylori in contributing to nonulcer dyspepsia or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug gastropathy remains controversial. An effective vaccine against H pylori is years away.

In the frame of the studies aimed at finding alternative therapies or at increasing the efficacy of the current ones and/or reducing their side effects, the investigation on the use of probiotics plays an interesting role. In vitro and preclinical studies have shown the feasibility of this approach. Several clinical trials indicated that administration of probiotics can reduce the side effects of H. pylori eradication treatment, increasing tolerability, and often increases the overall efficacy. The results of these trials vary, likely reflecting the variety of probiotics assessed and that of the eradication treatment, as well as the differences in the geographic area that imply different H. pylori strains distribution, host susceptibility, and therapy efficacy.

Tebentafusp and combined immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) with ipilimumab plus anti-PD-1 antibodies are the most commonly used treatment options but their comparative efficacy is unclear. The aim of this study is to compare currently available systemic treatments regarding overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) with a focus on the comparison of tebentafusp versus combined ICB.\nMETHODS: The protocol for this study was defined a priori and registered online in the PROSPERO international prospective register of systematic reviews (CRD42022308356, date of registration: 7.2.2022). We performed a systematic literature search in Medline, Embase, and Central to identify eligible studies reporting Kaplan-Meier curves or individual-level survival data showing OS and PFS for metastatic uveal melanoma patients treated with systemic treatments. Kaplan-Meier curves were digitized using the \"WebPlotDigitizer\" program. Individual-level survival data were subsequently remodelled and pooled for distinct treatment groups. To compare the OS of tebentafusp versus combined ICB, we used matching-adjusted indirect comparison (MAIC), two-stage MAIC (2SMAIC), and simulated treatment comparison (STC) together with digitized individual-level survival data as population-adjusted models.\nRESULTS: Overall, 55 independent studies were included of which 2,682 patients were evaluable for OS and 2,258 for PFS. Tebentafusp showed the highest median OS (mOS) of 22.4\u00a0months (95% confidence interval (CI): 19.9-29.6) compared to combined ICB (mOS: 15.7\u00a0months (95% CI: 14.4-17.9)), anti-PD-(L)1 antibody (mOS: 10.9\u00a0months (95% CI: 9.8-13.4)), chemotherapy (mOS: 9.95\u00a0months (95% CI: 8.9-11.2)), targeted therapies (mOS: 8.86\u00a0months (95% CI: 7.5-10.8)), and anti-CTLA-4 antibody (mOS: 7.8\u00a0months (95% CI: 6.8-9.3). The median PFS (mPFS) was similar among the treatment groups ranging from 2.7\u00a0months to 3.4\u00a0months. For the comparison of tebentafusp versus combined ICB, the hazard ratio (HR) was 0.641 (95% CI: 0.449-0.915) in the unadjusted model, whereas the population-adjusted models showed a HR of 0.386 (95% CI: 0.236-0.631) using MAIC, 0.378 (95% CI: 0.234-0.612) applying 2SMAIC and 0.284 (95% CI: 0.184-0.440) using STC.\nCONCLUSIONS: Tebentafusp achieved the best results compared to combined ICB and other systemic treatments, although these results have to be interpreted with caution due to the approximative methodical approach and high heterogeneity of included studies.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36970111": "Tebentafusp is a first-in-class immunotherapy agent that comprises an engineered T-cell receptor targeting a gp100 epitope presented by human leukocyte antigen-A*02:01 cells, fused to an anti-CD3 single-chain variable fragment.

Until January 2022, no systemic therapy had received regulatory approval for patients with metastatic uveal melanoma, and these patients have historically had a dismal prognosis owing to the limited efficacy of the available treatments. A series of seminal studies over the past two decades have identified highly prevalent early, tumour-initiating oncogenic genomic aberrations, later recurring prognostic alterations and immunological features that characterize uveal melanoma. These advances have driven the development of a number of novel emerging treatments, including tebentafusp, the first systemic therapy to achieve regulatory approval for this disease.

This report investigates putative exposure-symptom pathology by assembling a network model of published bio-behavioral pathways and assessing how dysregulation of such pathways might explain loss of function in these subjects using data available in the published literature. Given similarities in presentation with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), we used the latter as a clinically relevant means of evaluating if the neuropsychological profiles observed in Havana Syndrome Havana Syndrome might be explained at least in part by a dysregulation of neurotransmission, neuro-inflammation, or both.\nMETHOD: Automated text-mining of &gt;9,000 publications produced a network consisting of 273 documented regulatory interactions linking 29 neuro-chemical markers with 9 neuropsychological constructs from the Brief Mood Survey, PTSD Checklist, and the Frontal Systems Behavior Scale. Analysis of information flow through this network produced a set of regulatory rules reconciling to within a 6% departure known mechanistic pathways with neuropsychological profiles in N\u2009=\u20096 subjects.\nRESULTS: Predicted expression of neuro-chemical markers that jointly satisfy documented pathways and observed symptom profiles display characteristically elevated IL-1B, IL-10, NGF, and norepinephrine levels in the context of depressed BDNF, GDNF, IGF1, and glutamate expression (FDR\u2009<\u20095%). Elevations in CRH and IL-6 were also predicted unanimously across all subjects. Furthermore, simulations of neurological regulatory dynamics reveal subjects do not appear to be \"locked in\" persistent illness but rather appear to be engaged in a slow recovery trajectory.\nDISCUSSION: This computational analysis of measured neuropsychological symptoms in Havana-based diplomats proposes that these AHI symptoms may be supported in part by disruption of known neuroimmune and neurotransmission regulatory mechanisms also associated with mTBI.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35962646": "Since 2016, numerous American and Canadian diplomats and secret (intelligence) agents in Cuba, China, and other places in the world have experienced an abrupt onset of unusual clinical symptoms including, tinnitus, visual problems, vertigo, and cognitive difficulties, after they encountered strange sounds; this has been called \"Havana syndrome\" (HS).

At present, U.S. military medical personnel are not capable of adequately diagnosing or treating the injuries and illnesses that may result from exposure to potential neuroweapons. This fact was illustrated in 2016 when U.S. diplomats serving in Havana, Cuba reported hearing strange noises accompanied by a constellation of unexplained health effects. Similar incidents have been reported in China and Russia. Although various hypotheses have been put forward to explain these symptoms, none of them have been verified. The reported symptoms were analogous to the physiological responses that have been produced in the laboratory by exposing volunteers to pulsed microwave energy. However, these incidents of undetermined origin demonstrate that widespread neurological illness can be disruptive to U.S. government operations and that it is currently not possible to identify the cause, determine the correct treatment, or ascribe attribution to potential neuroweapon use in an overseas setting. Since it is likely that Special Operations medical personnel will be among the first to respond to neuroweapon attacks in the deployed environment, it is essential that they be made aware of this emerging threat and that efforts be made to incorporate potential directed energy neuroweapons and other neuroweapon configurations into future Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and high yield Explosives (CBRN-E) training modules.

In addition, the ways in which the typical causes of filovirus outbreaks differ from other zoonoses remain poorly described. In this study, we quantify factors associated with 45 outbreaks of African filoviruses (ebolaviruses and Marburg virus) using a rubric of 48 candidate causal drivers. For filovirus outbreaks, we reviewed &gt;700 peer-reviewed and gray literature sources and developed a list of the factors reported to contribute to each outbreak (i.e., a \"driver profile\" for each outbreak). We compare and contrast the profiles of filovirus outbreaks to 200 background outbreaks, randomly selected from a global database of 4463 outbreaks of bacterial and viral zoonotic diseases. We also test whether the quantitative patterns that we observed were robust to the influences of six covariates, country-level factors such as gross domestic product, population density, and latitude that have been shown to bias global outbreak data. We find that, regardless of whether covariates are included or excluded from models, the driver profile of filovirus outbreaks differs from that of background outbreaks. Socioeconomic factors such as trade and travel, wild game consumption, failures of medical procedures, and deficiencies in human health infrastructure were more frequently reported in filovirus outbreaks than in the comparison group.

Ebola and Marburg viruses are members of the Filoviridae family and easily distinguishable from viruses of other families by the characteristic morphology of the virion.

The current taxonomy has only been partially accepted by most laboratory virologists. Confusion likely arose for several reasons: species names that consist of several words or which (should) contain diacritical marks, the current orthographic identity of species and virus names, and the similar pronunciation of several virus abbreviations in the absence of guidance for the correct use of vernacular names. To rectify this problem, we suggest (1) to retain the current species names Reston ebolavirus, Sudan ebolavirus, and Zaire ebolavirus, but to replace the name Cote d'Ivoire ebolavirus [sic] with Ta\u00ef Forest ebolavirus and Lake Victoria marburgvirus with Marburg marburgvirus; (2) to revert the virus names of the type marburgviruses and ebolaviruses to those used for decades in the field (Marburg virus instead of Lake Victoria marburgvirus and Ebola virus instead of Zaire ebolavirus); (3) to introduce names for the remaining viruses reminiscent of jargon used by laboratory virologists but nevertheless different from species names (Reston virus, Sudan virus, Ta\u00ef Forest virus), and (4) to introduce distinct abbreviations for the individual viruses (RESTV for Reston virus, SUDV for Sudan virus, and TAFV for Ta\u00ef Forest virus), while retaining that for Marburg virus (MARV) and reintroducing that used over decades for Ebola virus (EBOV).

These candidate vaccines are currently being tested for immunogenicity and efficacy in nonhuman primates. Furthermore, the Ebola and Marburg VLPs are being used as a surrogate model to further understand the filovirus life cycle, with the goal of developing rationally designed vaccines and therapeutics.

Adverse birth outcomes (stillbirth, low birth weight (LBW), very LBW (VLBW)) and maternal outcomes (early and late pregnancy-related deaths, early and late hospitalizations) were compared by HIV/ART status and adjusted prevalence ratios (aPRs) calculated using log-binomial regression.\nRESULTS: Overall 171,960 pregnant people and their singleton newborns were included, 19% (N\u200a=\u200a32\u200a015) identified with HIV. Amongst pregnant people with HIV (PPHIV), 60% (N\u200a=\u200a19\u200a157) were on ART preconception, 29% (N\u200a=\u200a9276) initiated ART during pregnancy and 11% (N\u200a=\u200a3582) had no ART. Adjusted for maternal age, multiparity, hypertensive disorders and residential district, stillbirths were higher only for PPHIV not on ART [aPR 1.31 (95%CI 1.04-1.66)] compared to those without HIV. However, LBW and VLBW were higher among all PPHIV, with aPRs of 1.11-1.22 for LBW and 1.14-1.54 for VLBW. Pregnancy-initiated ART was associated with early pregnancy-related death (aPR 3.21; 95%CI 1.55-6.65), and HIV with or without ART was associated with late pregnancy-related death (aPRs 7.89-9.01).\nCONCLUSIONS: Even in the universal ART era, PPHIV experienced higher rates of LBW and VLBW newborns, and higher late pregnancy-related death regardless of ART status than pregnant people without HIV.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36629794": "OBJECTIVES: Early diagnosis of HIV is essential for successful treatment and controlling HIV spread in a population. We examined the frequency and characteristics of adults diagnosed late with HIV in New Zealand from 2011-2020.\nMETHODS: Routine surveillance data were analysed. Those previously diagnosed overseas or as part of immigration screening, or with missing CD4 count were excluded. 'Late presentation' was defined as a CD4 count <350 cells/\u03bcL or an AIDS-defining event. 'Advanced HIV disease' were those with a CD4 count <200 cells/\u03bcL or an AIDS-defining event. Relative risks were calculated using Poisson regression.\nRESULTS: Of 1145 people, 40.5% presented late; 24.9% had advanced HIV disease. Of the 464 late diagnoses, 65.5% occurred among men-who-have-sex-with-men (MSM), 26.1% among heterosexuals, 8.4% among others. Heterosexual men and women were more likely to present late (55.3%) compared to MSM (35.6%). Amongst MSM, those who were older, of an ethnicity other than European, acquired HIV overseas, tested because symptomatic, or had their last negative test >2\u00a0years prior were more likely to present late and have advanced disease. Amongst heterosexuals, older age, tested because symptomatic, and Pacific ethnicity were associated with late presentation, and M\u0101ori, Pacific and Asian people were more likely to have advanced disease.\nCONCLUSIONS: There continues to be a high proportion of people diagnosed late with HIV. Identifying barriers for testing, missed opportunities for screenings and other factors that delay HIV diagnosis could help develop effective strategies to reduce this burden of late presentation - particularly among heterosexual individuals, non-Europeans, and older people.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36630307": "Penile cancer is a rare malignancy which HIV infection appears to increase the risk of. The magnitude of this risk and the pathogenesis remain unclear. A comprehensive review of the literature was undertaken using conventional search strategies. Twenty-four publications were identified by this methodology, of which nine were case reports and 15 were observational studies. These studies were highly heterogeneous, with varying study designs, populations, and objectives. The risk of penile cancer within HIV-positive individuals is significantly greater than in those without HIV (RR = 3 .7 to 5.8, 3 studies; SIR = 3.8 to 11.1, 4 studies). HIV is also shown to influence disease characteristics, with a four-fold increased risk of death from penile cancer. Moreover, progression from intraepithelial neoplasia occurs earlier in HIV, six years sooner than in HIV-negative men. HIV-positive men have a higher prevalence of HPV infection. Ethnicity is also shown to modulate the relationship between HIV and penile carcinoma, with a higher risk of cancer in Hispanic, compared with Caucasian, HIV-positive men.

The prevalence of HAI was 29.9% (95% CI, 29.3, 30.4); The CCU during HAI in the last one month was 58.9%. Younger age at the start of sex work, use of mobile phone/internet for soliciting client, home as a place of sex work, consumption of alcohol/drug, and physical violence against FSWs were associated with higher odds of HAI. Frequent contact with outreach workers, awareness of sexually transmitted infection, and older age at the start of sex work was associated with CCU.\nCONCLUSION: Prevalence of HAI was high among FSW in India.

Most MS medications are available in the region, but not all, possibly affecting neurologists' prescribing habits.\nOBJECTIVES: To provide an overview of the current practices of Near East (NE) healthcare practitioners by probing their prescribing decisions, to report the COVID-19 impacts on neurologists' prescribing habits, and to explore the future relevance of current medication used in MS management among other newcomers.\nMETHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out using an online survey from April 27, 2022, to July 5, 2022. The questionnaire was designed with the input of five neurologists representing five NE countries (Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Jordan & Palestine). They identified several factors that play a crucial role in the optimal care of MS patients. The link was shared among neurologists using snowball sampling.\nRESULTS: The survey included 98 neurologists. Effectiveness and safety balance was the most important factor considered when selecting the MS treatment. Among patients with MS, the most challenging factor for the patients was thought to be related to family planning, followed by affordability and tolerability of side effects. In the treatment of mild to moderate relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) in men, Interferon beta 1a SC, Fingolimod, and Glatiramer acetate were the most commonly recommended treatments. Dimethyl fumarate substituted fingolimod in female patients. Interferon beta 1a SC was the safest treatment for mild to moderate RRMS. Interferon beta 1a SC was preferred over other treatments for patients with mild to moderate MS and planning for pregnancy (56.6%) or breastfeeding (60.2%).

Most (61.4%) had RRMS. Generally, platform injectables (IFN beta, glatiramer acetate) were the most used DMTs until 2010. It seems that introduction of newer agents (antiCD20s and oral DMTs) resulted in a decrease in the use of former drugs since around 2015. Some unusual practices are prominent such as using not approved DMTs for PPMS over the years, or administering high efficacy drugs like natalizumab for CIS. The results indicate the remaining popularity of first line injectable DMTs in female and pediatric patients.\nDISCUSSION: Mean age (SD) at onset in our study (29\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.8) is near the statistics in Asia and Oceania (28\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.7). Concerns about COVID-19 had a noticeable impact on administering high efficacy drugs like rituximab and fingolimod. However, in male patients this approach has not been the case. It may be related to more aggressive disease course in this group. The other possible explanation could be planning for pregnancy in female cases. The popularity of platform injectable drugs in pediatric MS may be related to its favorable safety profile over the years.

In 2010, prevalence of injectable DMTs was 43.1% compared to 2.5% for oral DMTs; by 2014, however, oral DMTs (26.5%) surpassed injectable DMTs (23.7%) as the most common route of administration. In the most recent data available (December, 2019), the most common DMTs were dimethyl fumarate, glatiramer acetate, and fingolimod.\nCONCLUSIONS: DMT use among reproductive-aged women has rapidly evolved during the past decade.

This randomized, controlled study explored the effect of early intervention with capnography on the incidence of hypoxia in mildly obese patients undergoing sedation for esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and colonoscopy.\nMETHODS: This is a single-center, randomized, single-blind, parallel-assignment, controlled trial. Mildly obese patients (28\u00a0kg/m2\u2009\u2264\u2009BMI\u2009&lt;\u200940\u00a0kg/m2) undergoing sedation for EGD and colonoscopy were randomly assigned to either the standard or capnography group. Standard cardiopulmonary monitoring equipment was used in both groups, and additional capnography was performed in the capnography group. In the event of inadequate alveolar ventilation during sedation, five interventions were administered in sequence (a-e) : a: increasing oxygen flow (5\u00a0L/min); b: a chin lift or jaw thrust maneuver; c: placement of the nasopharyngeal airway and chin lift; d: mask positive-pressure ventilation, and e: ventilator-assisted ventilation with tube insertion. The primary outcome was the incidence of hypoxia (SpO<sub>2</sub>\u2009&lt;\u200990%, \u2265\u200910\u00a0s) in each group. The secondary outcomes included the incidence of severe hypoxia (SpO<sub>2</sub>\u2009\u2264\u200985%), subclinical respiratory depression (90% \u2264 SpO<sub>2</sub>\u2009&lt;\u200995%), interventions, minimum SpO<sub>2</sub> during operation, patient satisfaction, endoscopist satisfaction, and other adverse events of anesthesia sedation.\nRESULTS: 228 patients were included (capnography group\u2009=\u2009112; standard group\u2009=\u2009113; three patients were excluded) in this study. The incidence of hypoxia was significantly lower in the capnography group than in the standard group (13.4% vs. 30.1%, P\u2009=\u20090.002). Subclinical respiratory depression in the capnography group was higher than that of the standard group (30.4% vs. 17.7%, P\u2009=\u20090.026). There was only a 5.4% incidence of severe hypoxia in the capnography group compared with 14.2% in the standard group (P\u2009=\u20090.026).

Capnography measures exhaled carbon dioxide and provides early identification of airway obstruction and hypoventilation. Capnography is useful in patients receiving supplemental oxygen. In these patients, oxygen desaturation reported by pulse oximetry may lag during episodes of respiratory depression and apnea.

It is hypothesized that the ocular pigmentary disturbance in Waardenburg's syndrome is widespread and involves the hyperchromic as well as the hypochromic areas of the eyes.

It is a benign tumor characterized by symmetrical diffuse adipose tissue deposition in the proximal extremities and neck. Until now, the etiology and pathogenesis of the disease have not been fully explained, resulting in difficulties in diagnosis and treatment; moreover, palliative treatment, such as surgical resection of adipose tissue or liposuction, is still the mainstream treatment for MD. However, the effectiveness of palliative surgery is limited, and most patients still relapse or metastasize after treatment. Therefore, we analyzed the relationship between tumor cells and immune cells in MD using single-cell RNA sequencing for the first time and combined an analysis of our results with a review of previous literature reports.

Lipectomy is typically necessary but such treatment can encounter difficulties due to the large sizes of the tumors, interspersed with important organs in the surrounding region. In this report, the authors evaluate the effectiveness of using tumescent solution in lipectomy to provide a dual treatment of tissue removal for Madelung disease in the head-and-neck region.\nMETHODS: A prospective study and clinical descriptions were conducted on 17 patients undergoing 26 head-and-neck lipectomies. A tumescent solution was injected into the surgical region with a blunt-tip cannula 5-10\u00a0min before skin incision. The authors recorded systemic manifestations both during and after surgery; tumescent volume; surgical region; clarity of the operative field; weight of fat removed, and early complications. After surgery, the authors followed the patients from periods of 3 months to 4 years.\nRESULTS: All 17 male patients had a history of alcoholism. In total, 12 lipectomies for the removal of anterior neck fatty masses and 14 lipectomies for the removal of posterior neck fatty masses were performed. The average amount of tumescent injected was 260.1\u00a0ml (range 140-550\u00a0ml). Surgery was reported as totally bloodless in 10 (38.5%) operative fields, with minimum bleeding in 12 (46.1%) operative fields, acceptable bleeding in four (15.4%) operative fields. The average surgical time was 175.6\u00a0min (range 135-250\u00a0min). The removed fatty masses weighed between 250 and 2150\u00a0g, with an average of 582.9\u00a0g. Early complications were seen in four patients, accounting for 15.4% (2 hematoma, 1 skin necrosis, and 1 seroma).\nCONCLUSIONS: Using tumescent solution in lipectomies to treat Madelung disease in the head and neck area is a simple, safe, and useful technique.

There are currently no systematic reviews summarizing the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of this disease. The purpose of the current article is to extract and analyze the existing evidence concerning Madelung disease derived from case series in order to provide adequate treatments for patients based on a more comprehensive understanding of the disease.\nMETHODS: PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases were queried for relevant articles using the search terms \"Madelung disease,\" \"multiple symmetric lipomatosis,\" \"Launois-Bensaude syndrome\" and synonyms until Aug 31,2020. Data statistics of Madelung disease epidemiology and clinical characteristics are summarized in different tables or charts with Microsoft Office software.\nRESULTS: Patients exhibiting Madelung disease were mostly located in Europe, although some records existed in Asia as well. Average patient age was between 45 and 65 years old. Type I was the most common form of the disease, and the neck was the most common location for tumors. Madelung disease is associated with various metabolic disorders, and hematoma and seroma were the most common complications. Overall recurrence rate was 18.3%, with similar recurrence rates after lipectomy and liposuction. Fewer complications occurred after liposuction compared with lipectomy, but relapse was more common after liposuction.\nCONCLUSION: Madelung disease consists of specific epidemiological and clinical characteristics, knowledge of which can be helpful for diagnosis and cognition. Lipectomy and liposuction are considered to be the most effective treatment methods for Madelung disease; however, choice of surgery should be based on comprehensive consideration of the disease, such as severity, mass location, and patient expectations.\nLEVEL OF EVIDENCE IV: This journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each article.

A new POP consisting of 4 mg drospirenone (DRSP) for 24 days plus 4-day hormone-free interval has been developed to address this need. DRSP is a potent progestin analogue of spironolactone, with antiandrogenic and antimineralocorticoid properties.\nAREAS COVERED: This is a narrative review of the available data on the pharmacotherapy of the new DRSP-only pill. The research includes aspects of pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of the compound: the main focus is on the clinical effects of DRSP-only pill in terms of contraceptive efficacy, haemostatic effect, safety, tolerability and bleeding patterns.\nEXPERT OPINION: The DRSP-only pill presents a similar Pearl Index to that of common combined hormonal contraceptives: it is a POP with a better bleeding profile than traditional POPs (higher rates of scheduled bleedings and much lower rates of unscheduled intracyclic bleeding/spotting) which could increase its acceptability and the panorama of possible users. For these reasons, DRSP-only pill represents a real step forward in oral contraception with only progestins, even if the bleeding patterns during its use are still different to oestrogen-containing products (i.e. lower rates of scheduled bleedings and higher rate of amenorrhea).", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31321765": "INTRODUCTION: Approximately 100 million women currently use combined oral contraceptives. Combined oral contraceptives use is associated with increased risk of venous thromboembolic events and cardiovascular disease. Progestin-only pills do not increase the risk of venous thromboembolic events, stroke and myocardial infarction but are associated with a poor cycle control. A novel estrogen-free pill containing only drospirenone (DRSP) was developed to improve bleeding pattern, tolerability and acceptance without increasing venous thromboembolic events risks in contraception.\nMATERIAL AND METHODS: Two prospective, multicenter Phase III studies in healthy women aged 18-45\u00a0years were performed to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of a drospirenone-only pill in a regimen of 24\u00a0days of 4\u00a0mg of drospirenone tablets followed by 4\u00a0days of placebo. A total of 1571 women (14\u00a0329 exposure cycles) were analyzed: 713 patients in the 13-cycle study 1 with 7638 exposure cycles and 858 patients in the 9-cycle study 2 with 6691 exposure cycles. The primary endpoint was the overall Pearl index, calculated for each study separately, and for both pooled. As main secondary efficacy endpoint, the \"method failure Pearl index\" including all pregnancies during \"perfect medication cycles\" was evaluated. EudraCT registration numbers: 2010-021787-15 & 2011-002396-42.\nRESULTS: Calculations on pooled studies 1 and 2 with 1571 patients gave an overall Pearl index (based on 14\u00a0329 cycles) of 0.7258 (95% CI 0.3133 to 1.4301). No single case of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism and only one case of hyperkalemia were reported. Additional information such as laboratory parameters, body mass index, bodyweight, heart rate and blood pressure showed no statistically significant changes due to the treatment.\nCONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of a new drospirenone-only oral contraceptive providing clinical efficacy similar to combined oral contraceptives, with a good safety profile, and favorable cycle control.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21080791": "Although combined oral contraceptives (COCs) are commonly used and highly effective in preventing pregnancy, they may not be suitable for some women. COC use is associated with increased rates of cardiovascular events and is not recommended in nonbreastfeeding women in the immediate postpartum period or in breastfeeding women during the initial 6 months of breastfeeding. Moreover, estrogen-related adverse effects, such as headache, are common. Estrogen-free progestin-only pills (POPs) are a valuable option in women who prefer to take an oral hormonal contraceptive, but are ineligible for, or choose not to use, COCs. Although some POPs have been associated with lower contraceptive effectiveness than COCs, the POP containing desogestrel has shown similar contraceptive effectiveness to COCs. The most commonly reported complaints in women using all POPs are bleeding problems. Counseling women interested in using POPs about the variable bleeding patterns associated with this method may improve compliance and acceptance.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36720088": "Breakthrough bleeding is a side effect of progesterone-only pills (POPs) in 40% of women, and is reduced to 10% with combined hormonal contraceptives (CHCs). In addition, breakthrough bleeding is reduced if POP is supplemented with norethisterone. As breakthrough bleeding is responsible for a quarter of women stopping the pill, it is vital to realize that CHC is an alternative to POP-even during lactation. CHCs are considered safe during lactation, do not reduce milk production, nor impede infant development. Nevertheless, CHCs are often not prescribed for lactating mothers due to this misconception that they reduce milk production. Among Orthodox Jews, breakthrough bleeding frequently results in stopping POP, as Jewish religious law prohibits any physical contact of the mother with her partner during active bleeding, and for 7 days after bleeding. When such bleeding occurs, not choosing a CHC alternative, results in couples risking discontinuation of POP, and in conceiving within a year of the previous birth, with its increased risk of preterm labor and birth defects. To measure how physicians respond to the presumed dilemma of balancing the risk of breakthrough bleeding versus the concern of reduction of milk production, we conducted a preliminary online survey. Physicians were asked if they would prescribe CHC instead of POP to breastfeeding mothers, 3 months postpartum with breakthrough bleeding. Half of the physicians responded they would prescribe CHC, whereas close to half of the physicians responded that they would not. The main reasons given by the respondents for avoiding CHC was a concern regarding possible milk reduction. These results confirm a significant degree of a lack of updated pharmacological information regarding the options of oral contraceptive use for lactating mothers, particularly for those where breakthrough bleeding has major behavioral and religious consequences. Thus, we contend that the risk of breakthrough bleeding justifies the more routine use of CHC in lieu of POP in lactating mothers.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38002722": "Until breastfeeding is established, progesterone-only pill (POP) use is preferable over combined hormonal contraception (CHC), as the latter potentially reduces milk production. Yet, POPs are often associated with breakthrough bleeding (BTB), and irregular spotting is often a reason for their cessation. Conversely, CHC is less associated with BTB but is not usually prescribed, even if breastfeeding has been established, despite its verified safety profile. Here, we surveyed physicians' perception of CHC safety during breastfeeding through an online questionnaire (N = 112). Physicians were asked if they would prescribe CHC to a woman three months postpartum, breastfeeding fully, and suffering from BTB while using POPs. Half of the physicians responded they would, 28% would not until six months postpartum, while 14% would not during breastfeeding. Of the physicians that would prescribe CHC, 58% would without any reservation, 24% would only after discussing milk reduction with the patient, 9% would use a pill with a lower hormonal dose, and 9% would only prescribe CHC 3 months postpartum. The main risk associated with CHC during breastfeeding, as perceived by physicians, is a potential decrease in breast milk production (88%). While some physicians consider CHC unsafe during breastfeeding, most health organizations consider CHC compatible with breastfeeding 5-6 weeks after birth. Thus, there is a gap in the attitude and knowledge of physicians about the safety profile of CHC, and only half acknowledge that the risk of BTB justifies the use of CHC instead of POPs while breastfeeding three months postpartum. We highlight the importance of physician's education, advocate CHC breastfeeding compatibility if breastfeeding has been established (i.e., 30 days postpartum), and underline the importance of discussing the option of CHC with patients in case POPs have unwanted side effects.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37195941": "BACKGROUND: Peresolimab is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody designed to stimulate the endogenous programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitory pathway.

The primary outcome was the change from baseline to week 12 in the Disease Activity Score for 28 joints based on the C-reactive protein level (DAS28-CRP). The DAS28-CRP ranges from 0 to 9.4, with higher scores indicating more severe disease. The primary comparison was between the 700-mg group and the placebo group. Secondary outcomes included the percentages of patients with American College of Rheumatology 20 (ACR20), ACR50, and ACR70 responses - defined as improvements from baseline of 20%, 50%, and 70% or more, respectively, in the numbers of tender and swollen joints and in at least three of five important domains - at week 12.\nRESULTS: At week 12, the change from baseline in the DAS28-CRP was significantly greater in the 700-mg peresolimab group than in the placebo group (least-squares mean change [\u00b1SE], -2.09\u00b10.18 vs. -0.99\u00b10.26; difference in change, -1.09 [95% confidence interval, -1.73 to -0.46]; P<0.001). The results of the analyses of secondary outcomes favored the 700-mg dose over placebo with respect to the ACR20 response but not with respect to the ACR50 and ACR70 responses. Adverse events were similar in the peresolimab and placebo groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: Peresolimab showed efficacy in a phase 2a trial in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

Data on the efficacy of novel corticosteroid formulations, developed specifically for esophageal delivery, have recently become available.\nMETHODS: A comprehensive review was performed aiming to summarize evidence on the role of STCs in the treatment of EoE. Two biomedical bibliographic databases (PubMED, EMBASE) were searched for articles providing original information on the efficacy and safety of STCs in adult EoE patients.\nRESULTS: Budesonide orodispersible tablet (BOT) and budesonide oral suspension (BOS) both surpassed placebo formulations regarding the efficacy of inducing and maintaining histologic, symptomatic and endoscopic remission. Overall, BOT displayed the highest grade of efficacy with clinico-histologic remission rates up to 75% after 1 year.

Our understanding of EoE pathophysiology has evolved since its initial recognition more than 20 years ago and has translated into diagnostic and novel therapeutic approaches that are affecting patient care. The mechanisms underlying disease development and progression are influenced by diverse factors, such as genetics, age, allergic comorbidities, and allergen exposures. Central to EoE pathophysiology is a dysregulated feed-forward cycle that develops between the esophageal epithelium and the immune system. Allergen-induced, type 2-biased immune activation by the esophageal epithelium propagates a cycle of impaired mucosal barrier integrity and allergic inflammation, eventually leading to tissue remodeling and progressive organ dysfunction. Herein, we review the current understanding of fundamental pathophysiological mechanisms contributing to EoE pathogenesis.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37064719": "INTRODUCTION: Under homeostatic conditions, esophageal epithelium displays a proliferation/differentiation gradient that is generated as proliferative basal cells give rise to suprabasal cells then terminally differentiated superficial cells. This proliferation/differentiation gradient is often perturbed in esophageal pathologies. Basal cell hyperplasia may occur in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), a condition in which acid from the stomach enters the esophagus, or eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), an emerging form of food allergy. While GERD is a primary risk factor for esophageal cancer, epidemiological data suggests that EoE patients do not develop esophageal cancer.\nMETHODS: In order to investigate the impact of EoE and esophageal cancer specifically on the cellular landscape of esophageal epithelium, we perform single cell RNA-sequencing in murine models of EoE and esophageal cancer, specifically esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). We further evaluate modules of co-expressed genes in EoE- and ESCC-enriched epithelial cell clusters. Finally, we pair EoE and ESCC murine models to examine the functional relationship between these pathologies.\nRESULTS: In mice with either EoE or ESCC, we find expansion of cell populations as compared to normal esophageal epithelium. In mice with EoE, we detect distinct expansion of 4 suprabasal populations coupled with depletion of 2 basal populations. By contrast, mice with ESCC display unique expansion of 2 basal populations and 1 suprabasal population, as well as depletion of 2 suprabasal populations. Senescence, glucocorticoid receptor signaling, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor pathways are associated with EoE-enriched clusters while pathways associated with cell proliferation and metabolism are identified in ESCC-enriched clusters. Finally, our in vivo data demonstrate that exposure to EoE inflammation limits tumor burden of esophageal carcinogenesis.\nDISCUSSION: Our findings provide the first functional investigation of the relationship between EoE and esophageal cancer and suggest that esophageal epithelial remodeling events occurring in response to EoE inflammation may limit esophageal carcinogenesis.

RE is characterized by epithelial infiltration with small numbers of neutrophils and eosinophils, EoE by a prominent eosinophilic infiltrate. Lymphocytic esophagitis (LE), a new entity characterized by peripapillary lymphocytosis, questions the role lymphocytes play in esophageal inflammation. We test the hypothesis that lymphocyte infiltration in RE differs from EoE. One blinded pathologist read esophageal biopsies from 39 RE and 39 EoE patients. Both groups demonstrated significant numbers of lymphocytes (RE 22.7 +/- 2.2/HPF, EoE 19.8 +/- 1.8/HPF). Eosinophils/HPF in RE and EoE were 2.8 +/- 0.7 and 74.9 +/- 8.2, respectively (P < 0.001). Neutrophils were uncommon in RE (0.26 +/- 0.16/HPF) and EoE (0.09 +/- 0.04; P = 0.07). Eight of the 39 RE specimens had >or=50 lymphocytes in >or=1 HPF. Two were consistent with LE. There was an inverse correlation between numbers of eosinophils and lymphocytes in EoE (R = -0.47; P = 0.002), and no correlation between them in RE (R = 0.18; P = 0.36). The patients with EoE who used antireflux medications had fewer lymphocytes (16.3 +/- 1.3 vs 22.2 +/- 2.3/HPF; P = 0.030) and eosinophils (55.6 +/- 5.2 vs 76.0 +/- 8.7/HPF; P = 0.042) than those who did not. The pathological role of lymphocytes in RE and EoE may be underestimated. Our observation that 5% of the RE specimens meet histopathological criteria for LE potentially blurs the line between these entities.

Patients with GERD were age-matched one to one with patients with EoE. Clinical, endoscopic, and histologic information at the time of diagnosis was obtained from the medical record and compared between pairs by McNemar test.

Many aspects of EoE were statistically distinct from GERD when controlling for age. Male sex, dysphagia, history of food impaction, absence of pain/heartburn, linear furrowing, and white papules were the distinguishing variables used to create the logistic regression model and scoring system based on odds ratios.

Uterine fibroid symptoms include abnormal menstrual bleeding leading to anaemia, tiredness, chronic vaginal discharge, and pain during periods. Other symptoms include protrusion of the abdomen, pain during intercourse, dysfunctions of bladder/bowel leading to urinary incontinence/retention, pain, and constipation.

Several next-generation sequencing technologies have been performed to identify the underlying genetic and epigenetic basis of fibroids. However, there remains a systemic gap in our understanding of molecular and biological process that define uterine fibroids. Recent epitranscriptomics studies have unraveled RNA modifications that are associated with all forms of RNA and are thought to influence both normal physiological functions and the progression of diseases. We quantified RNA expression profiles by analyzing publicly available RNA-seq data for 15 known epigenetic mediators to identify their expression profile in uterine fibroids compared to myometrium. To validate our findings, we performed RT-qPCR on a separate cohort of uterine fibroids targeting these modifiers confirming our RNA-seq data. We then examined protein profiles of key m6A modifiers in fibroids and their matched myometrium. In concordance with our RNA expression profiles, no significant differences were observed in these proteins in uterine fibroids compared to myometrium. To determine abundance of RNA modifications, mRNA and small RNA from fibroids and matched myometrium were analyzed by UHPLC MS/MS. In addition to the prevalent N6-methyladenosine (m6A), we identified 11 other known modifiers but did not identify any aberrant expression in fibroids.

The active antiviral component nirmatrelvir in Paxlovid is co-formulated with ritonavir, a strong cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 inhibitor. Many oral targeted therapies indicated for lung cancer are known substrates of CYP 3A4, and concurrent use with Paxlovid may lead to potential drug-drug interaction (DDI). The purpose of this review is to evaluate the potential DDI between targeted therapies and supportive care for lung cancer and ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir.\nMETHODS: Drug database search in PubMed and the Food and Drug Administration was conducted to identify pharmacokinetic data on oral tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) used in NSCLC, both Food and Drug Administration approved and those in development. Metabolism pathways for various TKIs are extracted, and the impact of TKI area under the curves and maximum concentration by strong CYP 3A4 inducers and inhibitors is summarized. The most common toxicities and supportive care medications for the TKI were identified.\nRESULTS: Among EGFR and exon 20 insertion inhibitors, afatinib is least likely to be affected by CYP 3A4, followed by dacomitinib and osimertinib. Among ALK inhibitors, alectinib is the least susceptible to CYP 3A4. ROS1 inhibitors are affected by CYP 3A4 inhibition with the exception of crizotinib. Among MET inhibitors, capmatinib is substantially affected by CYP 3A4 inhibition. Drug exposure of RET inhibitors is expected to increase with CYP 3A4 inhibition, with selpercatinib being the least affected. Certain supportive care medications for lung cancer TKI may have relevant DDIs.\nCONCLUSIONS: The clinical impact of the DDI between lung cancer TKI and ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir varies largely on the basis of the susceptibility of CYP 3A4 inhibition caused by the antiviral. Close monitoring and medication adjustments (i.e., dose changes or alternative coronavirus disease 2019 therapy) can be used to overcome DDI to ensure patient safety.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36572992": "OBJECTIVE: Selpercatinib and pralsetinib are new targeted therapies used to treat patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) due to RET gene rearrangements. The objective of this article is to review selpercatinib and pralsetinib in the context of RET-fusion-positive NSCLC.\nDATA SOURCES: The pivotal LIBRETTO-001 and ARROW trials were evaluated regarding the use of selpercatinib and pralsetinib as treatment for RET-fusion-positive NSCLC. Comparative studies, review articles and current studies on selpercatinib and pralsetinib in RET-fusion-positive NSCLC were searched on pubmed.org and scholar.google.com using \"selpercatinib,\" \"pralsetinib,\" and \"NSCLC\" as keywords. Product monographs were searched on google.ca and uptodate.com using the keywords \"selpercatinib,\" \"pralsetinib,\" and/or \"monograph.\"\nDATA SUMMARY: Selpercatinib and pralsetinib are orally administered highly selective RET inhibitors approved by the FDA following the accelerated approvals granted due to the pivotal LIBRETTO-001 and ARROW trials which evaluated selpercatinib and pralsetinib, respectively. Both drugs have shown efficacy for brain metastases and are primarily metabolized by CYP3A4 through hepatic metabolism. The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse effects of selpercatinib were hypertension, increased ALT level, and increased AST level while for pralsetinib, it was neutropenia, hypertension, and anemia. The safety profile shows similarities in severity and tolerability but additional monitoring for QT prolongation in patients on selpercatinib is recommended, compared to the risks of interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis for patients on pralsetinib.\nCONCLUSIONS: Overall, the increased use of selpercatinib and pralsetinib has led to the implementation of these drugs in the clinical practice of healthcare professionals such as pharmacists.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36626081": "PURPOSE: MTC has varying clinical course. In cases with metastatic disease (meta-MTC) further therapeutic modalities (locoregional and/or Tyrosine-Kinase-Inhibitors, TKIs) are needed. Clinical features, disease progression, response to therapy and possible factors predisposing to TKIs response-resistance in meta-MTCs were investigated.\nMETHODS: Out of 338 MTC patients 54 had meta-MTC and were followed for 0.7-46 years (median 10.5); therapeutic interventions and response to therapy were recorded retrospectively.\nRESULTS: Of 54 meta-MTC patients, 34/54 were men, 44/54 sporadic (age-at-diagnosis 47\u2009\u00b1\u200917.4 years, range: 5-78). Distant metastases at diagnosis were present in 12/54 (\u22652 loci in 8/12), 7/12 received TKIs; During follow-up metastases occurred in 42/54 (within 0.6-25 years from diagnosis, median 5\u2009yrs). Locoregional therapies were administered to 44/54 (81.5%) and TKIs to 40/54 (74.1%). Vandetanib was administered in 30 patients (24 as first-line therapy). The median progression-free-survival, PFS) was 48 months (range 4-120), partial response (PR): 26.7%, stable disease (SD): 23.3%, progressive disease (PD): 50.0%, cancer-specific survival: 44.8%, (16 in ongoing-therapy). More favorable disease course was recorded in familial-MTC compared to sporadic (p\u2009=\u20090.02) and in those patients with serious-adverse-events (SAEs) under treatment (p\u2009=\u20090.027). Those with biochemical progression under vandetanib, later showed more frequently structural progression (p\u2009=\u20090.007). Ten patients received cabozantinib (8/10 as second-line therapy, median PFS:11 months (3-36 months), 8/10 died). Three RET-mutant patients received selpercatinib; all showed PR. Within the total follow-up period, the response to therapy was: PR: 8/54 (14.8%), SD: 15/54 (27.8%), PD: 31/54 (57.4%), cancer-specific survival 46.3%. Mortality was higher in older patients (\u226560 years) compared to younger ones (<60\u2009yrs) (83.3 vs 45.2%, p\u2009=\u20090.021). Outcome was better in familial-MTC vs sporadic (PR: 50 vs 6.8%, SD: 20 vs 29.5%, PD: 30 vs 59.1%, p\u2009=\u20090.007).\nCONCLUSIONS: Meta-MTCs treatment results in disease stabilization in 42.6% during a median 10.5 year follow-up. Combination of locoregional and systemic therapies may result in more favorable PFS. Family history, younger age, SAEs may predict better response; biochemical escape under TKI needs to be followed-up closely as it may indicate disease progression.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36632846": "Precision oncology informed by genomic information has evolved in leaps and bounds over the last decade. Although non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has moved to center-stage as the poster child of precision oncology, multiple targetable genomic alterations have been identified in various cancer types. RET alterations occur in roughly 2% of all human cancers. The role of RET as oncogenic driver was initially identified in 1985 after the discovery that transfection with human lymphoma DNA transforms NIH-3T3 fibroblasts. Germline RET mutations are causative of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 syndrome, and RET fusions are found in 10-20% of papillary thyroid cases and are detected in most patients with advanced sporadic medullary thyroid cancer. RET fusions are oncogenic drivers in 2% of Non-small cell lung cancer. Rapid translation and regulatory approval of selective RET inhibitors, selpercatinib and pralsetinib, have opened up the field of RET precision oncology. This review provides an update on RET precision oncology from bench to bedside and back.

The novel role of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-35 in sepsis was examined. Methods: Sepsis was induced by in C57BL/6 mice cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). The impacts of IL-35 on effector CD4 + T cells were investigated by examining cell proliferation and the Th1/Th2 ratio in the presence of recombinant IL-35 (rIL-35) or anti-IL-35 (EBI3). The regulatory effect of IL-35 on autophagy was evaluated by measuring autophagy markers and autophagic flux in CLP mice in vivo and in activated effector CD4 + T cells in vitro . Results: IL-35 levels were significantly increased in the serum and spleens of septic mice. rIL-35 administration after CLP further decreased proliferation and the Th1/Th2 ratio in effector CD4 + T cells and significantly shortened the survival time. Sepsis-induced autophagy activation was protective in effector CD4 + T cells and was blocked by rIL-35. The inhibitory effect of IL-35 on autophagy was observed in activated effector CD4 + T cells in vitro , and this effect was mediated by restricting high mobility group box-1 protein (HMGB1) translocation. Conclusion: IL-35 is an immunosuppressive cytokine that impairs CD4 + T-cell proliferation and differentiation in sepsis, and the effect might be mediated by reducing HMGB1-dependent autophagy.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36579639": "PROBLEM: Interleukin 35 (IL-35) is involved in the pathogenesis of endometriosis by suppressing immunoreaction and promoting endometrial cell proliferation. It may also be an essential cytokine in forming the immunosuppressive functions of regulatory B lymphocytes (Bregs). The involvement of Bregs in the pathogenesis of endometriosis has not been previously investigated. In this study, we determined the frequencies of different Breg subpopulations, namely, B10, immature B-cells, and plasmablasts, and their abilities to produce IL-35 in women with endometriosis compared to healthy women.\nMETHODS: The frequencies of different subpopulations of Bregs producing IL-35 were measured in the peripheral blood of women with endometriosis (total pool), women with deep infiltration endometriosis (DIE), women with ovarian endometriosis, and healthy women as a control by flow cytometry.\nRESULTS: We observed a decrease in the percentage of B10 cells and plasmablasts in women with endometriosis and an increase in the percentage of these Breg populations producing IL-35 in the same experimental group. Interestingly, we also revealed that women with DIE had increased percentages of B10 cells and plasmablasts producing IL-35.\nCONCLUSION: Taken together, our findings are the first to reveal the frequencies of different subpopulations of Bregs producing IL-35 in women with endometriosis. The results suggest that IL-35 expression in B lymphocytes could be used as a peripheral marker of endometriosis; however, further studies are needed.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37464473": "BACKGROUND: Interleukin-35 (IL-35), secreted by regulatory T cells (Treg) and B cells, is immunosuppressive under both physiological and pathological conditions. However, the role of IL-35 in all responses has yet to be investigated. Here, we demonstrate that IL-35 protects allografts by stabilizing the Treg phenotype and suppressing CD8 + T-cell activation in a mouse heart transplantation model.\nMETHODS: The effect of IL-35 on immune cell infiltration in grafts and secondary lymphoid organs was examined using mass cytometry, flow cytometry, and immunofluorescence. Moreover, using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, flow cytometry, and phospho-flow assays, we demonstrated that IL-35 maintains Treg phenotypes to restrain CD8 + T cells via the gp130/signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 pathway.\nRESULTS: Mass cytometry analysis of intragraft immune cells showed that IL-35 decreased CD8 + T-cell infiltration and increased Foxp3 and IL-35 expressions in Treg. In vitro, we demonstrated that IL-35 directly promoted Treg phenotypic and functional stability and its IL-35 secretion, generating a positive feedback loop. However, Treg are required for IL-35 to exert its suppressive effect on CD8 + T cells in vitro. After depleting Treg in the recipient, IL-35 did not prolong graft survival or decrease CD8 + T-cell infiltration. Mechanistically, we found that IL-35 sustained Treg stability via the gp130/signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 signaling pathway.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight that IL-35 stabilizes the Treg phenotype to ameliorate CD8 + T-cell infiltration in the allograft, which has never been described in the transplanted immunological milieu.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36314719": "Interleukin 35 (IL-35) mediates immunosuppression of T cells in autoimmune diseases. T cells play an important role in primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) with incompletely elucidated pathogenesis. Thus, we aimed to investigate the role of IL-35 regulation on T cells in PBC patients. Fifty-one PBC patients and 28 controls were enrolled in this study. Plasma IL-35 level was measured. Purified peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were stimulated with exogenous IL-35 to investigate their functional phenotypes. IL-35-treated CD8+ T cells were cultured with human intrahepatic biliary epithelial cell line to determine the cytotoxicity of CD8+ T cells from PBC patients. Plasma IL-35 concentration was lower in PBC patients and negatively correlated with alkaline phosphatase. CD4+ T cells from PBC patients exhibited elevated transcription factor expressions and cytokine secretion, whereas CD8+ T cells produced increased cytotoxic molecules and cytokines. In vitro IL-35 stimulation suppressed the production of IL-17 and IL-22 by CD4+ T cells from PBC patients. CD8+ T cells treated with IL-35 mediated reduced target cell death in the direct contact co-culture system in PBC patients. This process was accompanied by reduced production of cytotoxic molecules and cytokines and increased expressions of immune checkpoint receptors in CD8+ T cells. Reduced circulating IL-35 might be insufficient to suppress T cell function, leading to the immune dysregulation in PBC patients.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29371247": "OBJECTIVE: IL-35 (interleukin-35) is an anti-inflammatory cytokine, which inhibits immune responses by inducing regulatory T cells and regulatory B cells and suppressing effector T cells and macrophages. It remains unknown whether atherogenic stimuli induce IL-35 and whether IL-35 inhibits atherogenic lipid-induced endothelial cell (EC) activation and atherosclerosis. EC activation induced by hyperlipidemia stimuli, including lysophosphatidylcholine is considered as an initiation step for monocyte recruitment and atherosclerosis. In this study, we examined the expression of IL-35 during early atherosclerosis and the roles and mechanisms of IL-35 in suppressing lysophosphatidylcholine-induced EC activation.\nAPPROACH AND RESULTS: Using microarray and ELISA, we found that IL-35 and its receptor are significantly induced during early atherosclerosis in the aortas and plasma of ApoE (apolipoprotein E) knockout mice-an atherosclerotic mouse model-and in the plasma of hypercholesterolemic patients. In addition, we found that IL-35 suppresses lysophosphatidylcholine-induced monocyte adhesion to human aortic ECs. Furthermore, our RNA-sequencing analysis shows that IL-35 selectively inhibits lysophosphatidylcholine-induced EC activation-related genes, such as ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion molecule-1). Mechanistically, using flow cytometry, mass spectrometry, electron spin resonance analyses, and chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing analyses, we found that IL-35 blocks lysophosphatidylcholine-induced mitochondrial reactive oxygen species, which are required for the induction of site-specific H3K14 (histone 3 lysine 14) acetylation, increased binding of proinflammatory transcription factor AP-1 in the promoter of ICAM-1, and induction of ICAM-1 transcription in human aortic EC. Finally, IL-35 cytokine therapy suppresses atherosclerotic lesion development in ApoE knockout mice.\nCONCLUSIONS: IL-35 is induced during atherosclerosis development and inhibits mitochondrial reactive oxygen species-H3K14 acetylation-AP-1-mediated EC activation.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33080902": "Ebolaviruses, discovered in 1976, belongs to the Filoviridae family, which also includes Marburg and Lloviu viruses. They are negative-stranded RNA viruses with six known species identified to date. Ebola virus (EBOV) is a member of Zaire ebolavirus species and can cause the Ebola virus disease (EVD), an emerging zoonotic disease that results in homeostatic imbalance and multi-organ failure. There are three EBOV outbreaks documented in the last six years resulting in significant morbidity (&gt; 32,000 cases) and mortality (&gt; 13,500 deaths). The potential factors contributing to the high infectivity of this virus include multiple entry mechanisms, susceptibility of the host cells, employment of multiple immune evasion mechanisms and rapid person-to-person transmission. EBOV infection leads to cytokine storm, disseminated intravascular coagulation, host T cell apoptosis as well as cell mediated and humoral immune response. In this review, a concise recap of cell types targeted by EBOV and EVD symptoms followed by detailed run-through of host innate and adaptive immune responses, virus-driven regulation and their combined effects contributing to the disease pathogenesis has been presented. At last, the vaccine and drug development initiatives as well as challenges related to the management of infection have been discussed.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30513823": "There is an increasing frequency of reports regarding the persistence of the Ebola virus (EBOV) in Ebola virus disease (EVD) survivors. During the 2014\u207b2016 West African EVD epidemic, sporadic transmission events resulted in the initiation of new chains of human-to-human transmission. Multiple reports strongly suggest that these re-emergences were linked to persistent EBOV infections and included sexual transmission from EVD survivors. Asymptomatic infection and long-term viral persistence in EVD survivors could result in incidental introductions of the Ebola virus in new geographic regions and raise important national and local public health concerns. Alarmingly, although the persistence of filoviruses and their potential for sexual transmission have been documented since the emergence of such viruses in 1967, there is limited knowledge regarding the events that result in filovirus transmission to, and persistence within, the male reproductive tract. Asymptomatic infection and long-term viral persistence in male EVD survivors could lead to incidental transfer of EBOV to new geographic regions, thereby generating widespread outbreaks that constitute a significant threat to national and global public health. Here, we review filovirus testicular persistence and discuss the current state of knowledge regarding the rates of persistence in male survivors, and mechanisms underlying reproductive tract localization and sexual transmission.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30381349": "Ebola virus (EBOV) has been responsible for sporadic outbreaks in Central Africa since 1976 and has the potential of causing social disruption and public panic as illustrated by the 2013-2016 epidemic in West Africa. Transmission of EBOV has been described to occur via contact with infected bodily fluids, supported by data indicating that infectious EBOV could be cultured from blood, semen, saliva, urine, and breast milk. Parameters influencing transmission of EBOV are, however, largely undefined in part due to the lack of an established animal model to study mechanisms of pathogen spread. Here, we investigated EBOV transmissibility in male and female ferrets. After intranasal challenge, an infected animal was placed in direct contact with a naive ferret and in contact with another naive ferret (separated from the infected animal by a metal mesh) that served as the indirect-contact animal. All challenged animals, male direct contacts, and one male indirect contact developed disease and died. The remaining animals were not viremic and remained asymptomatic but developed EBOV-glycoprotein IgM and/or IgG specific antibodies-indicative of virus transmission. EBOV transmission via indirect contact was frequently observed in this model but resulted in less-severe disease compared to direct contact. Interestingly, these observations are consistent with the detection of specific antibodies in humans living in areas of EBOV endemicity.IMPORTANCE Our knowledge regarding transmission of EBOV between individuals is vague and is mostly limited to spreading via direct contact with infectious bodily fluids. Studying transmission parameters such as dose and route of infection is nearly impossible in naturally acquired cases-hence the requirement for a laboratory animal model. Here, we show as a proof of concept that ferrets can be used to study EBOV transmission. We also show that transmission in the absence of direct contact is frequent, as all animals with indirect contact with the infected ferrets had detectable antibodies to the virus, and one succumbed to infection. Our report provides a new small-animal model for studying EBOV transmission that does not require adaptation of the virus, providing insight into virus transmission among humans during epidemics.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25719678": "As late as September 14, 2014, Liberia's Gbarpolu County had reported zero cases of Ebola virus disease (Ebola). On October 25, the Bong County Health Team, a local health department in the Liberian Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MOHSW), received confirmation of Ebola in a man who had recently left Geleyansiesu, a remote village of approximately 800 residents, after his wife and daughter had died of illnesses consistent with Ebola. MOHSW requested assistance from CDC, the World Health Organization, and other international partners to investigate and confirm the outbreak in Geleyansiesu and begin interventions to interrupt transmission. A total of 22 cases were identified, of which 18 (82%) were laboratory confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. There were 16 deaths (case-fatality rate = 73%). Without road access to or direct telecommunications with the village, interventions had to be tailored to the local context. Public health interventions included 1) education of the community about Ebola, transmission of the virus, signs and symptoms, the importance of isolating ill patients from family members, and the potential benefits of early diagnosis and treatment; 2) establishment of mechanisms to alert health authorities of possibly infected persons leaving the village to facilitate safe transport to the closest Ebola treatment unit (ETU); 3) case investigation, contact tracing, and monitoring of contacts; 4) training in hygienic burial of dead bodies; 5) active case finding and diagnosis; and 6) isolation and limited no-touch treatment in the village of patients unwilling or unable to seek care at an ETU.

Up to 90% of infected patients die, and there is no available treatment or vaccine. The sporadic human outbreaks are believed to result when EBOV \"jumps\" from an infected animal to a person and is subsequently transmitted between persons by direct contact with infected blood or body fluids. This study was undertaken to investigate the mechanism by which EBOV can persistently infect and then escape from model cell and animal reservoir systems. We report a model system in which infection of mouse and bat cell lines with EBOV leads to persistence, which can be broken with low levels of lipopolysaccharide or phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA). This reactivation depends on the Ras/MAPK pathway through inhibition of RNA-dependent protein kinase and eukaryotic initiation factor 2alpha phosphorylation and occurs at the level of protein synthesis. EBOV also can be evoked from mice 7 days after infection by PMA treatment, indicating that a similar mechanism occurs in vivo. Our findings suggest that EBOV may persist in nature through subclinical infection of a reservoir species, such as bats, and that appropriate physiological stimulation may result in increased replication and transmission to new hosts. Identification of a presumptive mechanism responsible for EBOV emergence from its reservoir underscores the \"hit-and-run\" nature of the initiation of human and/or nonhuman primate EBOV outbreaks and may provide insight into possible countermeasures to interfere with transmission.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36690705": "Patients with metastatic NSCLC bearing a ROS1 gene fusion usually experience prolonged disease control with ROS1-targeting tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), but significant clinical heterogeneity exists in part due to the presence of co-occurring genomic alterations.

At progression, the patient continued entrectinib and started sotorasib, a small molecule inhibitor of KRAS p.G12C. A patient-derived cell line generated at progression on entrectinib demonstrated improved TKI responsiveness when treated with entrectinib and sotorasib.

We compared the efficacy and safety of sotorasib with a standard-of-care treatment in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with the KRASG12C mutation who had been previously treated with other anticancer drugs.\nMETHODS: We conducted a randomised, open-label phase 3 trial at 148 centres in 22 countries. We recruited patients aged at least 18 years with KRASG12C-mutated advanced NSCLC, who progressed after previous platinum-based chemotherapy and a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor. Key exclusion criteria included new or progressing untreated brain lesions or symptomatic brain lesions, previously identified oncogenic driver mutation other than KRASG12C for which an approved therapy is available (eg EGFR or ALK), previous treatment with docetaxel (neoadjuvant or adjuvant docetaxel was allowed if the tumour did not progress within 6 months after the therapy was terminated), previous treatment with a direct KRASG12C inhibitor, systemic anticancer therapy within 28 days of study day 1, and therapeutic or palliative radiation therapy within 2 weeks of treatment initiation.

This discovery stemmed from our finding that Survivin expression is downregulated upon treatment of pancreatic cancer cells with the KRASG12C inhibitor Sotorasib. We went on to show that oncogenic KRAS increases Survivin expression by activating extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 in pancreatic cancer cells and that treating the cells either with siRNAs targeting Survivin or with YM155, a small molecule that potently blocks Survivin expression, downregulates MYC and strongly inhibited their growth. We further determined that Survivin protects MYC from degradation by blocking autophagy, which then prevents cellular inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A from undergoing autophagic degradation. Cellular inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A, by inhibiting protein phosphatase 2A, helps to maintain MYC phosphorylation at Ser 62, thereby ensuring its cooperation with oncogenic KRAS in driving cancer progression. Overall, these findings highlight a novel role for Survivin in mediating the cooperative actions of KRAS and MYC during malignant transformation and raise the possibility that targeting Survivin may offer therapeutic benefits against KRAS-driven cancers.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37387368": "INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: Vector diseases are common in Europe, including Poland. Every year, 77,000 Europeans are infected with transmissive diseases as a result of contact with infected vectors. In Poland, ticks are vectors of great epidemiological importance. The most important etiological factors causing disease in humans and transmitted by ticks include bacteria of the genus Borrelia and the species Francisella tularensis, Anaplasma phagophytophilum and Coxiella burnetii; as well as tick-borne encephalitis viruses. The level of the number of diagnosed cases of vector diseases in humans is influenced by environmental conditions, the most important of which is the COVID-19 pandemic that has been spreading for two years.\nOBJECTIVE: The aim of the review was to assess knowledge about tick-borne diseases in humans, as well as etiological factors, epidemiology of these diseases in Poland and other European countries. Infection with pathogens can occur both during recreation in nature and during work related to a profession. Professional groups include those particularly exposed to contact with vectors and pathogens - foresters, farmers and soldiers.\nREVIEW METHODS: A comprehensive assessment was conducted of extant publications.\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE STATE OF KNOWLEDGE: The results of the literature research revealed that in recent years an increase in the number of people suffering from tick-borne diseases has been recorded, possibly influenced by the changing climate. The vector diseases of the greatest importance for the inhabitants of Poland include Lyme disease and tick-borne encephalitis.\nSUMMARY: Soldiers, as a professional group who perform their duties in an environment where there is a high risk of exposure to infected ticks, are particularly at risk of acquiring transmission of vector diseases.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35190334": "Q fever is a global zoonotic infection caused by the intracellular Gram-negative bacterium Coxiella burnetii. Historically, it is considered a vector-borne disease, but the role of ticks in transmission has not fully been elucidated yet. Excretion of C. burnetii in tick feces and saliva is well documented but the role of these findings or the epidemiological context is discussed controversially. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of C. burnetii DNA in ticks to clarify the potential role of tick species for maintenance of C. burnetii infection. A literature review was performed using Google scholar, Agora, Science Direct, PubMed and Scopus to identify original studies on C. burnetii DNA presence in ticks. The search was limited to literature published from 2009 to 2020 in English and French and focused on data obtained by molecular detection of C. burnetii DNA in ticks. Overall, the prevalence of C. burnetii in ticks collected in Africa varied from 2.91% to 13.97%, in Europe from 2.46% to 10.52% and the Middle East from 4.76% to 12.53%. Ticks collected from animals showed a prevalence of 8% (95% CI: 6%-10%), followed by ticks collected from the environment and animals of 7% (95% CI: 5%-10%). C. burnetii DNA has been found in samples of many tick species with the highest prevalence in Rhipicephalus evertsi and Amblyomma variegatum. However, most of these studies did not include a differentiation between C. burnetii and Coxiella-like endosymbionts making it finally difficult to estimate the potential role that ticks play in the epidemiology of Q fever. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze the vector competence of different tick species to transmit C. burnetii. Knowledge of the vector and reservoir competence of ticks is important for taking adequate preventive measures to limit infection risks.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37866329": "Ticks are the main vectors for the transmission of bacterial, protist and viral pathogens in Europe affecting wildlife and domestic animals. However, some of them are zoonotic and can cause serious, sometimes fatal, problems in human health. A systematic review in PubMed/MEDLINE database was conducted to determine the spatial distribution and host and tick species ranges of a selection of tick-borne bacteria (Anaplasma spp., Borrelia spp., Coxiella spp., and Rickettsia spp.), protists (Babesia spp. and Theileria spp.), and viruses (Orthonairovirus, and flaviviruses tick-borne encephalitis virus and louping ill virus) on the European continent in a five-year period (November 2017 - November 2022). Only studies using PCR methods were selected, retrieving a total of 429 articles. Overall, up to 85 species of the selected tick-borne pathogens were reported from 36 European countries, and Anaplasma spp. was described in 37% (159/429) of the articles, followed by Babesia spp. (34%, 148/429), Borrelia spp. (34%, 147/429), Rickettsia spp. (33%, 142/429), Theileria spp. (11%, 47/429), tick-borne flaviviruses (9%, 37/429), Orthonairovirus (7%, 28/429) and Coxiella spp. (5%, 20/429). Host and tick ranges included 97 and 50 species, respectively. The highest tick-borne pathogen diversity was detected in domestic animals, and 12 species were shared between humans, wildlife, and domestic hosts, highlighting the following zoonotic species: Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Babesia divergens, Babesia microti, Borrelia afzelii, Borrelia burgdorferi s.s., Borrelia garinii, Borrelia miyamotoi, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, Coxiella burnetii, Rickettsia monacensis and tick-borne encephalitis virus.

We argue that, although ticks may readily transmit C. burnetii in experimental systems, they only occasionally transmit the pathogen in the field. Furthermore, we underscore that many Coxiella-like bacteria are widespread in ticks and may have been misidentified as C. burnetii. Our recommendation is to improve the methods currently used to detect and characterize C. burnetii, and we propose that further knowledge of Coxiella-like bacteria will yield new insights into Q fever evolutionary ecology and C. burnetii virulence factors.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33406079": "Q fever is a widespread zoonotic disease caused by the intracellular bacterium Coxiella burnetii.

However, recent observations revealed that endosymbionts of ticks have been commonly misidentified as C. burnetii, calling the importance of tick-borne transmission into question. In this study, we re-evaluated the vector competence of the African soft tick Ornithodoros moubata for an avirulent strain of C. burnetii. To this end, we used an artificial feeding system to initiate infection of ticks, specific molecular tools to monitor further infections, and culture assays in axenic and cell media to check for the viability of C. burnetii excreted by ticks. We observed typical traits associated with vector competence: The exposure to an infected blood meal resulted in viable and persistent infections in ticks, trans-stadial transmissions of infection from nymphs to adults and the ability of adult ticks to transmit infectious C. burnetii. However, in contrast to early studies, we found that infection differed substantially between tick organs. In addition, while adult female ticks were infected, we did not observe C. burnetii in eggs, suggesting that transovarial transmission is not effective. Finally, we detected only a sporadic presence of C. burnetii DNA in tick faeces, but no living bacterium was further isolated in culture assays, suggesting that excretion in faeces is not a common mode of transmission in O. moubata.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36946211": "INTRODUCTION: Methotrexate (MTX) is an antifolate and immunosuppressive drug prescribed for various malignancies and immune diseases. However, delayed elimination of MTX associated with concomitant use of some medications can lead to severe and lifethreatening adverse effects.\nAREAS COVERED: This paper investigated drugMTX interactions that lead to elevated MTX levels and related adverse effects due to the role of transporters. Methotrexate toxicity occurs at both low and high doses administrations. According to the studies we reviewed in this paper, most interaction records with methotrexate occurred with coadministration of indomethacin, ketoprofen, omeprazole, piperacillin/tazobactam, ciprofloxacin, cotrimoxazole, probenecid, and imatinib, mainly due to the role of transporters. However, most studies were performed as case reports or series, and confirming the exact drugmethotrexate interaction still needs further clinical investigations.\nEXPERT OPINION: Our findings showed no firm evidence of interactions of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), levetiracetam, and NSAIDS with MTX. Moreover, patients' risk factors, hypoalbuminemia, renal failure, third space fluid retention, the elderly, polypharmacy, and transport inhibition are the most critical factors for MTX toxicity.

Several cancers, including gastrointestinal, gynecological, breast, lung, and squamous cell head and neck cancers overexpress FR and are currently under investigation to correlate receptor status to disease state. Traditional chemotherapies have included antifolate medications, such as methotrexate and pemetrexed, which generate anticancer activity during the synthesis phase of the cell cycle. Increasingly, the repertoire of pharmacotherapies is expanding to include FR as a target, with a heterogenous pool of directed therapies.

In oncology, methotrexate is frequently administered at a high dose (>1 g/m(2)) and comes with various procedures to reduce the occurrence of toxicity and particularly to ensure optimal renal elimination. Drug-drug interactions involving methotrexate are the origin of severe side effects owing to delayed elimination of the antifolate and, more rarely, of decreased efficacy in relation to suboptimal exposure. Most of these interactions are driven by membrane drug transporters whose activity/expression can be inhibited by the interacting medication. In the last 10 years, research on drug transporters has permitted retrospective identification of the molecular mechanisms underlying drug-drug interactions with methotrexate. This article summarizes reported drug-drug interactions involving methotrexate in clinical oncology with reference to the role of drug transporters that control the disposition of the antifolate agent.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20579471": "Methotrexate (MTX) is an antimetabolite and antifolate drug used in the treatment of cancer and autoimmune diseases.

Cutaneous toxicity is usually dose-related and generally occurs when recommended guidelines are ignored or there is a decrease in renal excretion. Self-medication is a problem with unknown prevalence. Signs of MTX toxicity include bone marrow suppression, hepatotoxicity, and mucocutaneous toxicity. Painful erosions of psoriatic plaques and, less commonly, erosions in patients without psoriasis have been reported as an early sign of MTX toxicity.

Folate antagonists, purine analogues, and pyrimidine analogues are the three main categories of antimetabolites. Methotrexate, the most studied folate antagonist, is effective in many malignancies. Methotrexate inhibits dihydrofolate reductase, which leads to accumulation of polyglutamated folates, causing further inhibition of thymidylate synthase and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase. Subsequently, the lack of reduced folate substrates impairs synthesis of purine nucleotides, thymidylate, and certain amino acids, which can lead to cell death. However, methotrexate resistance develops through several mechanisms, including decreased folate carrier-mediated membrane transport, dihydrofolate reductase gene amplification, specific transcription-translational modifications, and downregulation of intracellular methotrexate polyglutamation. Antifolate drug development has focused on agents designed to overcome different aspects of methotrexate resistance. This article reviews the enzymatic targets for antifolates, describes the known mechanisms of antifolate resistance, and summarizes the current development of novel antifolate agents.

So far, the repurposing of drugs has been exercised heavily for the identification of therapeutic agents against COVID-19, which led FDA to approve many drugs for the same e.g., remdesivir, favipiravir, ribavirin, etc. The anti-COVID drugs explored via other approaches include nirmatrelvir (used in combination with ritonavir as Paxlovid), tixagevimab and cilgavimab (both used in combination with each other) and others. However, these approved drugs failed to achieve a significant clinical outcome. Globally, natural bioactive have also been explored for anti-COVID-19 effects, based on their traditional medicinal values. Although the clinical findings suggest that FDA-approved drugs and natural bioactives can help reducing the overall mortality rate but the significant clinical outcome was not achieved. Therefore, the focus has been shifted towards new drug development. In line with that, a lot of work has been done and still going on to explore heterocyclic compounds as potent anti- COVID-19 drugs. Several heterocyclic scaffolds have been previously reported with potent antiinflammatory, anticancer, anti-viral, antimicrobial and anti-tubercular effects. Few of them are under consideration for clinical trials whereas others are under preclinical investigation. Hence, this review discusses the evidence of rationally designed and tested heterocyclic compounds acting on different targets against COVID-19. The present article will help the researches and will serve as a pivotal resource in the design and development of novel anti-COVID-19 drugs.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37969744": "Paxlovid is a nirmatrelvir (NMV) and ritonavir (RTV) co-packaged medication used for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The active component of Paxlovid is NMV and RTV is a pharmacokinetic booster. Our work aimed to investigate the drug/herb-drug interactions associated with Paxlovid and provide mechanism-based guidance for the clinical use of Paxlovid. By using recombinant human cytochrome P450s (CYPs), we confirmed that CYP3A4 and 3A5 are the major enzymes responsible for NMV metabolism. The role of CYP3A in Paxlovid metabolism were further verified in Cyp3a-null mice, which showed that the deficiency of CYP3A significantly suppressed the metabolism of NMV and RTV. Pregnane X receptor (PXR) is a ligand-dependent transcription factor that upregulates CYP3A4/5 expression. We next explored the impact of drug- and herb-mediated PXR activation on Paxlovid metabolism in a transgenic mouse model expressing human PXR and CYP3A4/5. We found that PXR activation increased CYP3A4/5 expression, accelerated NMV metabolism, and reduced the systemic exposure of NMV. In summary, our work demonstrated that PXR activation can cause drug interactions with Paxlovid, suggesting that PXR-activating drugs and herbs should be used cautiously in COVID-19 patients receiving Paxlovid.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36181334": "One of the most recently described clinical associations with SARS-CoV-2 infection is rebound COVID-19, which occurs between five and eight days following the cessation of antiviral treatment. Most case reports of rebound COVID-19 have been associated with cessation of treatment with the combined oral antiviral agent nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid). On 24 May 2022, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a Health Alert Network (HAN) Health Advisory update for patients, healthcare providers, and public health departments on COVID-19 rebound or recurrence of COVID-19. However, population data from the US showed no significant differences in the risk of developing rebound COVID-19 between patients treated with Paxlovid and Molnupiravir. The mechanisms of rebound COVID-19 remain unclear but may involve the development of resistance to the antiviral drug, impaired immunity to the virus, or insufficient drug dosing. A further explanation may be the persistence of a high viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in individuals who are no longer symptomatic.

Approaches based on effect size estimates from each study are generally regarded as the most informative. However, these methods can only be used if comparable effect sizes can be computed from each study, and this may not be the case due to variation in how the studies were done or limitations in how their results were reported. Other methods, such as vote counting, are then used to summarize the results of these studies, but most of these methods are limited in that they do not provide any indication of the magnitude of effect. We propose a novel plot, the albatross plot, which requires only a 1-sided P value and a total sample size from each study (or equivalently a 2-sided P value, direction of effect and total sample size). The plot allows an approximate examination of underlying effect sizes and the potential to identify sources of heterogeneity across studies. This is achieved by drawing contours showing the range of effect sizes that might lead to each P value for given sample sizes, under simple study designs. We provide examples of albatross plots using data from previous meta-analyses, allowing for comparison of results, and an example from when a meta-analysis was not possible.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34035181": "The published evidence on whether workplace health and well-being interventions are as effective in male-dominated industries compared with mixed-gender environments has not been synthesised. We performed a systematic review of workplace interventions aimed at improving employee health and well-being in male-dominated industries. We searched Web of Knowledge, PubMed, Medline, Cochrane Database and Web of Science for articles describing workplace interventions in male-dominated industries that address employee health and well-being. The primary outcome was to determine the effectiveness of the intervention and the process evaluation (intervention delivery and adherence). To assess the quality of evidence, Cochrane Collaboration's Risk of Bias Tool was used. Due to the heterogeneity of reported outcomes, meta-analysis was performed for only some outcomes and a narrative synthesis with albatross plots was presented. After full-text screening, 35 studies met the eligibility criteria. Thirty-two studies delivered the intervention face-to-face, while two were delivered via internet and one using postal mail. Intervention adherence ranged from 50% to 97%, dependent on mode of delivery and industry. 17 studies were considered low risk of bias. Albatross plots indicated some evidence of positive associations, particularly for interventions focusing on musculoskeletal disorders. There was little evidence of intervention effect on body mass index and systolic or diastolic blood pressure. Limited to moderate evidence of beneficial effects was found for workplace health and well-being interventions conducted within male-dominated industries.

Parents are assumed to play an important role in influencing children's PA. Earlier reviews have mainly focused on parental modelling, encouragement, and support for PA, rather than the actual PA levels of parents. Therefore, the purpose of this review was to systematically summarize the evidence on the relationship between parent and child PA.\nMETHODS: Papers were identified using electronic databases and manual searches of reference lists. Papers reporting on associations between objectively measured child PA and at least one measure of parental PA were included. The quality of the papers was assessed using a modified version of the ROBINS-I tool. For interpretation of the results across studies, we produced albatross plots for all studies combined and by age-groups, sex of the parents, sex of the child, methodology of assessment of parental PA, and type of PA.\nRESULTS: Thirty-nine papers were included with sample size of parent-child dyads ranging from 15 to 1267 (mean\u2009=\u2009319 dyads, median\u2009=\u2009227 dyads). The majority of studies were published from 2008 to 2018 and used accelerometry to assess PA. Most of the studies were classified as having moderate, serious, or critical risk of bias. The albatross plot for all studies combined showed that the clear majority of studies observed a positive relationship between parent and child PA. The plot suggested an average magnitude of correlation across studies to be around 0.13, and the overall impression was that this was fairly similar across child age-groups and gender of parent-child dyads. Studies using objective assessment of parental PA showed stronger relationship between parent and child PA compared with studies using self-report (average magnitude of correlation around 0.16 vs 0.04 respectively). No clear evidence was found for the strength of relationship being dependent on type of PA measure of parent and child (total PA, moderate-to-vigorous PA, steps), however, the relationship for light PA appeared weaker.\nCONCLUSION: This systematic review showed that the clear majority of studies observed a weak positive relationship between parent and child PA regardless of age of the child, the gender of the parent-child dyad, and type of PA.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: Registration in PROSPERO: CRD42019093462.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33771150": "BACKGROUND: Opioid related overdoses and overdose deaths continue to constitute an urgent public health crisis. The implementation of naloxone programs, such as 'take-home naloxone' (THN), has emerged as a key intervention in reducing opioid overdose deaths. These programs aim to train individuals at risk of witnessing or experiencing an opioid overdose to recognize an opioid overdose and respond with naloxone. Naloxone effectively reverses opioid overdoses on a physiological level; however, there are outstanding questions on community THN program effectiveness (adverse events, dosing requirements, dose-response between routes of administration) and implementation (accessibility, availability, and affordability). The objective of this scoping review is to identify existing systematic reviews and best practice guidelines relevant to clinical and operational guidance on the distribution of THN.\nMETHODS: Using the Arksey & O'Malley framework for scoping reviews, we searched both academic literature and grey literature databases using keywords (Naloxone) AND (Overdose) AND (Guideline OR Review OR Recommendation OR Toolkit). Only documents which had a structured review of evidence and/or provided summaries or recommendations based on evidence were included (systematic reviews, meta-analyses, scoping reviews, short-cut or rapid reviews, practice/clinical guidelines, and reports). Data were extracted from selected evidence in two key areas: (1) study identifiers; and (2) methodological characteristics.\nRESULTS: A total of 47 articles met inclusion criteria: 20 systematic reviews; 10 grey literature articles; 8 short-cut or rapid reviews; 4 scoping reviews; and 5 other review types (e.g. mapping review and comprehensive reviews). The most common subject themes were: naloxone effectiveness, safety, provision feasibility/acceptability of naloxone distribution, dosing and routes of administration, overdose response after naloxone administration, cost-effectiveness, naloxone training and education, and recommendations for policy, practice and gaps in knowledge.\nCONCLUSIONS: Several recent systematic reviews address the effectiveness of take-home naloxone programs, naloxone dosing/route of administration, and naloxone provision models. Gaps remain in the evidence around evaluating cost-effectiveness, training parameters and strategies, and adverse events following naloxone administration. As THN programs continue to expand in response to opioid overdose deaths, this review will contribute to understanding the evidence base for policy and THN program development and expansion.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31420089": "Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a chronic, relapsing condition, often associated with legal, interpersonal, and employment problems. Medications demonstrated to be effective for OUD are methadone (a full opioid agonist), buprenorphine (a partial agonist), and naltrexone (an opioid antagonist). Methadone and buprenorphine act by suppressing opioid withdrawal symptoms and attenuating the effects of other opioids. Naltrexone blocks the effects of opioid agonists. Oral methadone has the strongest evidence for effectiveness. Longer duration of treatment allows restoration of social connections and is associated with better outcomes. Treatments for OUD may be limited by poor adherence to treatment recommendations and by high rates of relapse and increased risk of overdose after leaving treatment. Treatment with methadone and buprenorphine has the additional risk of diversion and misuse of medication. New depot and implant formulations of buprenorphine and naltrexone have been developed to address issues of safety and problems of poor treatment adherence. For people with OUD who do not respond to these treatments, there is accumulating evidence for supervised injectable opioid treatment (prescribing pharmaceutical heroin). Another medication mode of minimizing risk of overdose is take-home naloxone. Naloxone is an opioid antagonist used to reverse opioid overdose, and take-home naloxone programs aim to prevent fatal overdose. All medication-assisted treatment is limited by lack of access and by stigma. In seeking to stem the rising toll from OUD, expanding access to approved treatment such as methadone, for which there remains the best evidence of efficacy, may be the most useful approach.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36123614": "BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has amplified the need for wide deployment of effective harm reduction strategies in preventing opioid overdose mortality. Placing naloxone in the hands of key responders, including law enforcement officers who are often first on the scene of a suspected overdose, is one such strategy. New York State (NYS) was one of the first states to implement a statewide law enforcement naloxone administration program. This article provides an overview of the law enforcement administration of naloxone in NYS between 2015 and 2020 and highlights key characteristics of over 9000 opioid overdose reversal events.\nMETHODS: Data in naloxone usage report forms completed by police officers were compiled and analyzed. Data included 9133 naloxone administration reports by 5835 unique officers located in 60 counties across NYS. Descriptive statistics were used to examine attributes of the aided individuals, including differences between fatal and non-fatal incidents. Additional descriptive analyses were conducted for incidents in which law enforcement officers arrived first at the scene of suspected overdose. Comparisons were made to examine year-over-year trends in administration as naloxone formulations were changed. Quantitative analysis was supplemented by content analysis of officers' notes (n\u2009=\u20092192).\nRESULTS: In 85.9% of cases, law enforcement officers arrived at the scene of a suspected overdose prior to emergency medical services (EMS) personnel. These officers assessed the likelihood of an opioid overdose having occurred based on the aided person's breathing status and other information obtained on the scene. They administered an average of 2 doses of naloxone to aided individuals. In 36.8% of cases, they reported additional administration of naloxone by other responders including EMS, fire departments, and laypersons. Data indicated the aided survived the suspected overdose in 87.4% of cases.\nCONCLUSIONS: With appropriate training, law enforcement personnel were able to recognize opioid overdoses and prevent fatalities by administering naloxone and carrying out time-sensitive medical interventions. These officers provided life-saving services to aided individuals alongside other responders including EMS, fire departments, and bystanders. Further expansion of law enforcement naloxone administration nationally and internationally could help decrease opioid overdose mortality.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33682423": "Opioid overdose is the leading cause of death for Americans 25 to 64 years of age, and opioid use disorder affects >2 million Americans. The epidemiology of opioid-associated out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in the United States is changing rapidly, with exponential increases in death resulting from synthetic opioids and linear increases in heroin deaths more than offsetting modest reductions in deaths from prescription opioids. The pathophysiology of polysubstance toxidromes involving opioids, asphyxial death, and prolonged hypoxemia leading to global ischemia (cardiac arrest) differs from that of sudden cardiac arrest. People who use opioids may also develop bacteremia, central nervous system vasculitis and leukoencephalopathy, torsades de pointes, pulmonary vasculopathy, and pulmonary edema. Emergency management of opioid poisoning requires recognition by the lay public or emergency dispatchers, prompt emergency response, and effective ventilation coupled to compressions in the setting of opioid-associated out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Effective ventilation is challenging to teach, whereas naloxone, an opioid antagonist, can be administered by emergency medical personnel, trained laypeople, and the general public with dispatcher instruction to prevent cardiac arrest. Opioid education and naloxone distributions programs have been developed to teach people who are likely to encounter a person with opioid poisoning how to administer naloxone, deliver high-quality compressions, and perform rescue breathing. Current American Heart Association recommendations call for laypeople and others who cannot reliably establish the presence of a pulse to initiate cardiopulmonary resuscitation in any individual who is unconscious and not breathing normally; if opioid overdose is suspected, naloxone should also be administered. Secondary prevention, including counseling, opioid overdose education with take-home naloxone, and medication for opioid use disorder, is important to prevent recurrent opioid overdose.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30924736": "The opioid crisis is a growing concern for Americans, and it has become the leading cause of injury-related death in the United States. An adjunct to respiratory support that can reduce this high mortality rate is the administration of naloxone by Emergency Medical Services (EMS) practitioners for patients with suspected opioid overdose. However, clear evidence-based guidelines to direct EMS use of naloxone for opioid overdose have not been developed. Leveraging the recent Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) systematic review on the EMS administration of naloxone for opioid poisonings, federal partners determined the need for a clinical practice guideline for EMS practitioners faced with suspected opioid poisoning. Project funding was provided by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, Office of EMS, (NHTSA OEMS), and the Health Resources and Services Administration, Maternal and Child Health Bureau's EMS for Children Program (EMSC). The objectives of this project were to develop and disseminate an evidence-based guideline and model protocol for administration of naloxone by EMS practitioners to persons with suspected opioid overdose. We have four recommendations relating to route of administration, all conditional, and all supported by low or very low certainty of evidence. We recommend the intravenous route of administration to facilitate titration of dose, and disfavor the intramuscular route due to difficulty with titration, slower time to clinical effect, and potential exposure to needles. We equally recommend the intranasal and intravenous routes of administration, while noting there are variables which will determine which route is best for each patient. Where we are unable to make recommendations due to evidence limitations (dosing, titration, timing, and transport) we offer technical remarks. Limitations of our work include the introduction of novel synthetic opioids after many of the reviewed papers were produced, which may affect the dose of naloxone required for effect, high risk of bias and imprecision in the reviewed papers, and the introduction of new naloxone administration devices since many of the reviewed papers were published.

Sparsentan significantly delayed onset of glomerulosclerosis, interstitial fibrosis, proteinuria, and glomerular filtration rate decline. Sparsentan attenuated glomerular basement membrane defects, blunted mesangial filopodial invasion into the glomerular capillaries, increased lifespan more than losartan, and lessened changes in profibrotic/pro-inflammatory gene pathways in both the glomerular and the renal cortical compartments. Notably, treatment with sparsentan, but not losartan, prevented accumulation of extracellular matrix in the strial capillary basement membranes in the inner ear and reduced susceptibility to hearing loss.

The pathogenic antibodies mostly belong to the immunoglobulin subclass (Ig)G4, a feature which attributes them their specific properties and pathogenic profile. On the other hand, acetylcholine receptor (AChR) MG, the most prevalent form of MG, is characterized by immunoglobulin (Ig)G1 and IgG3 antibodies to the AChR. IgG4 class autoantibodies are impotent to fix complement and only weakly bind Fc-receptors expressed on immune cells and exert their pathogenicity via interfering with the interaction between their targets and binding partners (e.g. between MuSK and LRP4). Cardinal differences between AChR and MuSK-MG are the thymus involvement (not prominent in MuSK-MG), the distinct HLA alleles, and core immunopathological patterns of pathology in neuromuscular junction, structure, and function. In MuSK-MG, classical treatment options are usually less effective (e.g. IVIG) with the need for prolonged and high doses of steroids difficult to be tapered to control symptoms. Exceptional clinical response to plasmapheresis and rituximab has been particularly observed in these patients. Reduction of antibody titers follows the clinical efficacy of anti-CD20 therapies, a feature implying the role of short-lived plasma cells (SLPB) in autoantibody production. Novel therapeutic monoclonal against B cells at different stages of their maturation (like plasmablasts), or against molecules involved in B cell activation, represent promising therapeutic targets. A revolution in autoantibody-mediated diseases is pharmacological interference with the neonatal Fc receptor, leading to a rapid reduction of circulating IgGs (including autoantibodies), an approach already suitable for AChR-MG and promising for MuSK-MG. New precision medicine approaches involve Chimeric autoantibody receptor T (CAAR-T) cells that are engineered to target antigen-specific B cells in MuSK-MG and represent a milestone in the development of targeted immunotherapies. This review aims to provide a detailed update on the pathomechanisms involved in MuSK-MG (cellular and humoral aberrations), fostering the understanding of the latest indications regarding the efficacy of different treatment strategies.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35967183": "Introduction Fever is the most common presenting symptom in children and causes distress in patients and parents. Although nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly used as antipyretics, they should be reserved for pain or chronic inflammatory conditions due to safety concerns. If we can safely achieve the same antipyretic effect using a higher dose (20 mg/kg) of paracetamol, NSAIDs may be avoided for treating fever. There is a paucity of literature comparing the antipyretic effect of mefenamic acid and high-dose paracetamol. We hypothesized that there would be no difference in the antipyretic effect of high-dose paracetamol and mefenamic acid. Methods In this randomized control trial, 165 febrile children were randomly allocated to one of the following three groups: standard-dose (15 mg/kg) paracetamol (SDPCM) as the control group and high-dose (20 mg/kg) paracetamol (HDPCM) and mefenamic acid (6 mg/kg) (MFN) as the intervention groups. The temperature was measured using a digital thermometer at the start of drug dosage and every 15 minutes until it reached normal. One-way between-group analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare outcome measures such as time for\u00a0temperature to reach normal, fall of temperature in 60 minutes, and time for the next fever. Post hoc analysis was performed to compare mean differences. Patients were monitored for adverse effects. Results Out of 165 enrolled patients, 159 were analyzed. The baseline demographic data were comparable among the groups. There was a statistically significant difference in the mean time taken for the temperature to reach normal (F-value (F) (2,156)=3.184, p<0.05) and the mean reduction in temperature at 60 minutes (F (2,156)=23.40, p<0.001) among the groups. The mean time for temperature to reach normal in the\u00a0SDPCM group (97.50\u00b126.60 minutes) was longer than that in the HDPCM\u00a0(85.09\u00b131.43 minutes) and MFN\u00a0(84.90\u00b130.42 minutes) groups. The decrease in temperature over 60 minutes was greater in the HDPCM (0.46\u00b0C\u00b10.19\u00b0C) and MFN (0.45\u00b0C\u00b10.11\u00b0C) groups than in the SDPCM (0.33\u00b0C\u00b10.10\u00b0C) group. The time to the next fever spike was shorter for the SDPCM\u00a0group (5.07\u00b12.66 hours) than for the HDPCM (7.20\u00b13.08 hours) and MFN (8.82\u00b13.83 hours) groups. Post hoc analysis demonstrated that high-dose paracetamol and mefenamic acid had similar and faster antipyretic effects than standard-dose paracetamol. Although the duration of action was found to be longer in the mefenamic acid group, the difference was not statistically significant. There were negligible adverse effects in the groups. Conclusion\u00a0 Standard-dose paracetamol (15 mg/kg/dose) had a slower and shorter antipyretic effect than high-dose paracetamol (20 mg/kg/dose) and mefenamic acid (6 mg/kg/dose). A single dose of high-dose paracetamol was safe and had a similar antipyretic effect as mefenamic acid. Mefenamic acid may be avoided as an antipyretic and spared for pain and anti-inflammatory indications.

The overall aim of the present publication was to overview guidance and provide an algorithm for use in the emergency setting as well as recommendations to inform parents for home care. To obtain consensus, a core steering committee drafted a management algorithm and general consensus was obtained by remote voting among experts. A number of common messages are found in current guidelines: management of fever depends on age, antipyretics are indicated only for discomfort; paracetamol or ibuprofen can be recommended; physical methods for lowering temperature are discouraged. A consensus algorithm is presented in which infants <28 days are considered separately, while those >28 days and <90 days are divided into those ill or well appearing. All infants <28 days with fever \u226537.5 \u00b0C should undergo complete work-up for sepsis, strongly considered to receive empirical antibiotics \u00b1 acyclovir, and be hospitalized. All infants (between 28 and 90 days) ill appearing should undergo diagnostic work-up for sepsis, receive empirical antibiotics, and be hospitalized. In well appearing infants, diagnostic work-up should be carried out to decide admission to hospital and administration of antibiotics. Specific recommendations are also given for home discharge that can be used to inform parents about the actions to take during home care in the attempt to reinforce existing guidelines.

Currently there are no guidelines for assessment and management of fever specifically for community and primary healthcare workers in the sub-Saharan Africa region. This multidisciplinary consensus guide was developed to assist pharmacists and primary healthcare workers in sub-Saharan Africa to risk stratify and manage children who present with fever, decide when to refer, and how to advise parents and caregivers. Fever is defined as body temperature \u2265\u00a037.5\u00a0\u00b0C and is a normal physiological response to illness that facilitates and accelerates recovery. Although it is often associated with self-limiting illness, it causes significant concern to both parents and attending healthcare workers. Clinical signs may be used by pharmacy staff and primary healthcare workers to determine level of distress and to distinguish between a child with fever who is at high risk of serious illness and who requires specific treatment, hospitalisation or specialist care, and those at low risk who could be managed conservatively at home. In children with warning signs, serious causes of fever that may need to be excluded include infections (including malaria), non-infective inflammatory conditions and malignancy. Simple febrile convulsions are not in themselves harmful, and are not necessarily indicative of serious infection. In the absence of illness requiring specific treatment, relief from distress is the primary indication for prescribing pharmacotherapy, and antipyretics should not be administered with the sole intention of reducing body temperature. Care must be taken not to overdose medications and clear instructions should be given to parents/caregivers on managing the child at home and when to seek further medical care.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9578327": "Entering both the old dispute (whether fever is adaptive or maladaptive) and its more recent modification (whether hypothermia is protective or detrimental in systemic inflammation), we suggest a new solution. We hypothesize that fever and hypothermia represent two different strategies of fighting systemic inflammation, each developed as an adaptive response to certain conditions, and each beneficial under these conditions. The antimicrobial and immunostimulating benefits of a high body temperature could be easily offset by its high energy cost. Fever, therefore, is protective only when there is no immediate threat of a substantial energy deficit. Hypothermia, on the other hand, constitutes a response aimed at energy conservation and, as such, is beneficial exactly under the conditions of a substantial energy deficit. The two thermoregulatory responses represent two complementary strategies of survival in systemic inflammation: fever ensures the active attack against the pathogen; hypothermia secures the defense of the host's vital systems. The importance of each response's contribution to the whole campaign depends on the severity of the pathogenic insult, premorbid pathology, and current conditions (stress, nutrition, ambient temperature, etc.).", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33738101": "Although fever is one of the main presenting symptoms of COVID-19 infection, little public attention has been given to fever as an evolved defense. Fever, the regulated increase in the body temperature, is part of the evolved systemic reaction to infection known as the acute phase response. The heat of fever augments the performance of immune cells, induces stress on pathogens and infected cells directly, and combines with other stressors to provide a nonspecific immune defense. Observational trials in humans suggest a survival benefit from fever, and randomized trials published before COVID-19 do not support fever reduction in patients with infection. Like public health measures that seem burdensome and excessive, fevers involve costly trade-offs but they can prevent infection from getting out of control. For infections with novel SARS-CoV-2, the precautionary principle applies: unless evidence suggests otherwise, we advise that fever should be allowed to run its course. Lay summary: For COVID-19, many public health organizations have advised treating fever with medicines such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Even though this is a common practice, lowering body temperature has not improved survival in laboratory animals or in patients with infections. Blocking fever can be harmful because fever, along with other sickness symptoms, evolved as a defense against infection. Fever works by causing more damage to pathogens and infected cells than it does to healthy cells in the body.

The patient's medical history was significant for poorly controlled HIV. Imaging demonstrated a large mass in the rectum and the patient was admitted to the colorectal surgery service for management of presumed rectal cancer. Sigmoidoscopy demonstrated a rectal stricture and biopsies showed severe proctitis without evidence for malignancy. Given the patient's history and discordant clinical findings an infectious workup was pursued. The patient tested positive for syphilis and was diagnosed with syphilitic proctitis. He underwent treatment with penicillin and although he experienced a Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction, his bowel obstruction completely resolved. Final pathology on the rectal biopsies demonstrated positive Warthin-Starry and spirochete immunohistochemical stain.\nDISCUSSION: This case illustrates key aspects in the care of a patient with syphilitic proctitis mimicking an obstructing rectal cancer, including the need for high clinical suspicion, thorough evaluation including sexual and sexually transmitted disease history, multidisciplinary communication, and management of the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction.\nCONCLUSION: Severe proctitis leading to large bowel obstruction is a possible presentation of syphilis, and a high degree of clinical suspicion is necessary to be able to accurately identify the cause.

Neuropsychiatric adverse effects of domperidone such as akathisia and depression are previously described. It has never been reported to be associated with infanticide ideation. The aim of this article is to discuss the occurrence of infanticide ideation following domperidone usage in an adoptive mother and the potential mechanisms by which these may occur. Methods: With Institutional Review Board approval, we herein report a nulliparous adoptive mother who developed infanticide ideation after 3 months of exposure to domperidone. The infanticide ideation was intrusive, recurrent, ego-dystonic, causing significant depressive symptoms and affecting the patient's functions. Physical examination and relevant biological investigations were unremarkable. Results: The patient is treated as domperidone-induced obsessional thought with adjustment disorder. The domperidone was stopped immediately. Serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors was started. The infanticide ideation gradually resolved and patient achieved complete remission after 10 months of treatment. Conclusion: The infanticide ideation following consumption of domperidone is a potential neuropsychiatric adverse event that warrants further examination into the safety of domperidone as an \"off-labeled\" galactagogue.

Conclusion: Domperidone as a galactagogue may pose a significant psychiatric risk upon discontinuation. This presentation is commonly confused with, but clinically distinct from, postpartum depression. Lactating mothers who present with psychiatric symptoms should be explicitly probed about domperidone use, even in areas where domperidone is not authorized for use.

Complications of OCD include interpersonal difficulties, unemployment, substance abuse, criminal justice issues, and physical injuries. Areas of the brain involved in the pathophysiology include the orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate gyrus, and basal ganglia.

In this study, we utilized magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) in an effort to provide a better understanding of the role of brain gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate in the pathophysiology of OCD. We hypothesized that beyond the separate effects of these neurotransmitter systems, a disruption in the balance between GABA and glutamate could be particularly relevant to OCD.\nMETHODS: We obtained MRS measures of GABA and glutamate concentrations in the anterior cingulate cortex from 23 adult patients with OCD and 20 sex- and age-matched healthy community volunteers. Established clinical rating scales were used to assess the severities of OCD, anxiety, and depression symptoms. Statistical analysis involved the assessment of patient-control group differences in the individual measures of GABA and glutamate, as well as in the ratio of the GABA to glutamate measures. Additionally, we explored whether differences in the MRS measures existed between two subgroups of patients formed according to the severity of their OCD symptoms. Finally, we assessed the relations of demographic and clinical variables to the MRS measures.\nRESULTS: Patients with OCD displayed a higher estimated GABA level and a higher GABA to glutamate ratio than healthy participants, but no significant group differences were observed in the measure of glutamate. The MRS measures did not vary by subgroup and showed no correlations with demographic and clinical variables.\nCONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that GABA abnormalities within the anterior cingulate cortex contribute to the pathophysiology of OCD. The results fail to provide evidence that glutamate abnormalities alone are involved in adult OCD.

Although advanced extraction approaches have been applied to some clinical research reviews, existing methods are not well suited for addressing toxicology or environmental health questions due to unique data needs to support reviews in these fields.\nOBJECTIVES: To develop and evaluate a flexible, web-based tool for semi-automated data extraction that: 1) makes data extraction predictions with user verification, 2) integrates token-level annotations, and 3) connects extracted entities to support hierarchical data extraction.\nMETHODS: Dextr was developed with Agile software methodology using a two-team approach. The development team outlined proposed features and coded the software. The advisory team guided developers and evaluated Dextr's performance on precision, recall, and extraction time by comparing a manual extraction workflow to a semi-automated extraction workflow using a dataset of 51 environmental health animal studies.\nRESULTS: The semi-automated workflow did not appear to affect precision rate (96.0% vs. 95.4% manual, p\u00a0=\u00a00.38), resulted in a small reduction in recall rate (91.8% vs. 97.0% manual, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01), and substantially reduced the median extraction time (436\u00a0s vs. 933\u00a0s per study manual, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) compared to a manual workflow.\nDISCUSSION: Dextr provides similar performance to manual extraction in terms of recall and precision and greatly reduces data extraction time. Unlike other tools, Dextr provides the ability to extract complex concepts (e.g., multiple experiments with various exposures and doses within a single study), properly connect the extracted elements within a study, and effectively limit the work required by researchers to generate machine-readable, annotated exports. The Dextr tool addresses data-extraction challenges associated with environmental health sciences literature with a simple user interface, incorporates the key capabilities of user verification and entity connecting, provides a platform for further automation developments, and has the potential to improve data extraction for literature reviews in this and other fields.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32856160": "The use of primary care electronic health records for research is abundant. The benefits gained from utilising such records lies in their size, longitudinal data collection and data quality. However, the use of such data to undertake high quality epidemiological studies, can lead to significant challenges particularly in dealing with misclassification, variation in coding and the significant effort required to pre-process the data in a meaningful format for statistical analysis. In this paper, we describe a methodology to aid with the extraction and processing of such databases, delivered by a novel software programme; the \"Data extraction for epidemiological research\" (DExtER). The basis of DExtER relies on principles of extract, transform and load processes. The tool initially provides the ability for the healthcare dataset to be extracted, then transformed in a format whereby data is normalised, converted and reformatted. DExtER has a user interface designed to obtain data extracts specific to each research question and observational study design. There are facilities to input the requirements for; eligible study period, definition of exposed and unexposed groups, outcome measures and important baseline covariates. To date the tool has been utilised and validated in a multitude of settings. There have been over 35 peer-reviewed publications using the tool, and DExtER has been implemented as a validated public health surveillance tool for obtaining accurate statistics on epidemiology of key morbidities. Future direction of this work will be the application of the framework to linked as well as international datasets and the development of standardised methods for conducting electronic pre-processing and extraction from datasets for research purposes.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37402676": "Records of secondary hydrocephalus patients undergoing shunt surgery in the Department of Neurosurgery of Peking Union Medical College Hospital from September 2012 to April 2022 and their clinical characteristics and outcomes were retrospectively reviewed and analyzed. Among 121 patients who received first time shunt placement, the most common causes of secondary hydrocephalus were brain hemorrhage (55, 45.5%) and trauma (35, 28.9%). Cognition decline (106, 87.6%), abnormal gait (50, 41.3%) and incontinence (40, 33.1%) were the most prevalent manifestations.

Gravitation-assisted shunt valves are designed to prevent hydrostatic over-drainage frequently observed in the long course of shunt-treated hydrocephalus. We prospectively studied and analyzed the implication, safety, and feasibility for an adjustable gravitational unit combined with a fixed differential-pressure (DP) valve for neonates and infants primary shunted within the first 12 months of life.\nMETHODS: Clinical course of hydrocephalic neonates and infants who received initial VP-shunt insertion in the early post-natal phase were monitored prospectively on the basis of our digital institutional Hydrocephalus & Shunt Registry. All patients were equipped with a fixed DP valve combined with a programmable gravitational unit activated in upright body position. Patients with a minimum shunt follow-up of 24 months were considered for further statistical analysis regarding hydrocephalus etiology, surgical setting, pre- and post-operative ventricular enlargement, head circumference, valve pressure setting, implication for the adjustment option of the gravitational unit, type and number of shunt complications, and revision-free shunt and valve survival.\nRESULTS: Seventy-eight pediatric patients received primary VP-shunt insertion at a mean age of 10 weeks with age gestationally corrected for preterm neonates. Hydrocephalus was related to perinatal IVH (64%), CNS malformation (11%), spina bifida (9%), congenital aqueductal stenosis (9%), and idiopathic (4%) or post-infectious etiology (3%). Fifty-two patients (70%) presented with history of prematurity (gestational age 23-36 weeks). Regular follow-up carried out for a mean period of 63 months demonstrated that ventricular enlargement decreased significantly after applied treatment and excessive head growth could be counteracted effectively. At least one pressure level adjustment was performed in 31% of all patients after 12 months, in 42% after 24 months, and in 64% at the time of last clinical follow-up since initial shunt insertion. Pressure level adjustments were successful in cases of clinical or radiographic signs of under- or over-drainage for individual patients of various ages during entire clinical course. Mean pressure setting for upright position was 24.1 cm H<sub>2</sub>O at the time of initial shunt insertion and increased to 26.4 cmH<sub>2</sub>O at the time of last clinical follow-up. Revision-free shunt-survival rates after 12 and 24 months were 79% and 70% and valve-survival rates 91% and 90%, respectively.\nCONCLUSION: The combination of a fixed DP valve with an adjustable gravitational unit utilized as first-line shunt regimen was feasible and safe in a highly vulnerable subgroup of hydrocephalic infants. The adjustment option for the gravitational unit showed frequent and increasing implication over time and was beneficial even during the very early developmental stage of limited autonomous mobility.

Though effective, shunts are associated with risk of dysfunction leading to multiple surgical revisions, affecting patient quality-of-life and incurring high healthcare costs. There is a need for ambulatory monitoring systems for life-long assessment of shunt status. The present study aimed to develop a preclinical model assessing the feasibility of our wireless device for continuous monitoring of cerebral pressure in shunts.\nMETHODS: We first adapted a previous hydrocephalus model in sheep, which used an intracisternal kaolin injection. Seven animals were used to establish the model, and 1 sheep with naturally dilated ventricles was used as control. Hydrocephalus was confirmed by clinical examination and brain imaging before inserting the ventriculoperitoneal shunts and the monitoring device allowing continuous measurement of the pressure through the shunt for a few days in 3 sheep. An external ventricular drain was used as gold standard.\nRESULTS: Our results showed that a reduction in kaolin dose associated to postoperative management was crucial to reduce morbidity and mortality rates in the model. Ventriculomegaly was confirmed by imaging 4 days after injection of 75mg kaolin into the cisterna magna. For the implanted sheep, recordings revealed high sensitivity of our sensor in detecting fluctuations in cerebral pressure compared to conventional measurements.\nCONCLUSIONS: This proof-of-concept study highlights the potential of this preclinical model for testing new shunt devices.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21961546": "Ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt placement is the most common surgical treatment for hydrocephalus.

Laparoscopic shunt placement has been associated with decreased operating time, less blood loss, and shorter hospital stays. The authors describe a single-incision laparoscopic shunt (SILS) insertion technique that facilitates directed placement of the peritoneal portion of the catheter in children. A total of 6 pediatric patients underwent the SILS procedure between December 2008 and March 2009. This cohort included 5 girls and 1 boy; the average age was 6 years (range 1 day-16 years). One patient had previously undergone a VP shunt placement, but all other patients were undergoing the initial creation of their shunt. The most common pathological condition encountered was posttraumatic hydrocephalus (2 patients). All patients underwent successful placement of the peritoneal catheters. All catheters were seen to have CSF flowing freely within the peritoneal space. The authors' recent experience shows that SILS placement is safe and feasible in children.

A retrospective institutional analysis and review of patient records in those who had undergone PFL surgery was performed. In so doing, the authors identified patients that went on to develop post-operative hydrocephalus. The study included pediatric and adult patients treated between 2009 and 2017. Fifteen of 40 pediatric (37.5%) and 18 of 262 adult (6.9%) patients developed hydrocephalus after PFL surgery.

Microglia, the primary immune cells in the brain, undergo rapid activation and phenotypic polarization, which are crucial for regulating neuroinflammatory responses following ischemic stroke. Melatonin is a promising neuroprotective agent that can regulate microglial polarization in central nervous system (CNS) diseases. However, the specific mechanism underlying the neuroprotective effects of melatonin against ischemic stroke-induced brain injury by modulating microglial polarization after ischemic stroke remains poorly understood. To investigate this mechanism, we used the transient middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (tMCAO/R) model in C57BL/6 mice to induce ischemic stroke and administered intraperitoneal melatonin (20\u00a0mg/kg) or an equivalent volume of vehicle daily after reperfusion. Our results demonstrated that melatonin treatment reduced the infarct volume, prevented neuronal loss and apoptosis, and improved neurological deficits after ischemic stroke. Furthermore, melatonin attenuated microglial activation and reactive astrogliosis, while promoting the polarization of microglia toward M2 phenotype via signal transducer and activator of transcription 1/6 (STAT1/6) pathways. Collectively, these findings suggest that melatonin exerts neuroprotective effects against ischemic stroke-induced brain injury by modulating microglial polarization toward M2 phenotype and has the potential as a promising candidate for the treatment of ischemic stroke.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37321200": "INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to investigate how melatonin administration for 3 days or 7 days following cerebral ischemia (CI) injury would affect autophagy and, therefore, survival in neurons of the penumbra region.

After the start of reperfusion, the groups were treated with melatonin (10 mg/kg/day) for 3 days or 7 days. In all groups, neurological deficit scoring, rotarod, and adhesive removal tests were executed during reperfusion. Infarct areas were determined by TTC (2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride) staining at the end of the 3rd and 7th days of reperfusion. Beclin-1, LC3, p62, and caspase-3 protein levels were assessed using Western blot and immunofluorescence methods in the brain tissues.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of melatonin on CCH-induced AD pathology, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and synaptic plasticity, all of which are correlated with the activation of oxidative stress, apoptosis, and cognitive impairment. CCH was induced in male Wistar rats by bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (2VO).

Unless ischemia is promptly reversed, reperfusion produces further cerebral damage. Acute thrombolysis or defibrinogenation is effective only in selective patients with ischemic stroke and carries a significant risk of bleeding complications. Whereas numerous neuroprotectants were shown to be effective in experimental studies, none of them have been shown to work in clinical trials. The major pathogenetic mechanisms of ischemia/reperfusion injury include excitotoxicity, disturbed calcium ion homeostasis, overproduction of nitric oxide and other free radicals, inflammation, and apoptosis. Nitric oxide and other free radicals, the key mediators of excitotoxicity and disturbed calcium ion homeostasis, cause direct injury and also indirectly damage via inflammation and apoptosis. Melatonin is a potent free radical scavenger and an indirect antioxidant. This mini review summarizes the in vivo and in vitro evidence that melatonin protects against ischemia/reperfusion injury. There is convincing evidence from the literature that melatonin treatment is highly effective in different in vivo and in vitro models of excitotoxicity or ischemia/reperfusion in multiple animal species. Melatonin is safe and non-toxic in humans, and its administration via the oral route or intravenous injection is convenient. While more experimental studies should be conducted to further explore the neuroprotective mechanisms and to document any synergistic or additive protection from combining melatonin with thrombolysis, defibrinogenation or other neuroprotectants, interested clinical scientists should consider planning phase II and III studies to confirm the benefit of melatonin as an acute stroke treatment or a preventive measure for stroke patients.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24646622": "Melatonin, a natural product of the pineal gland, has been shown to protect against ischemic stroke, but the molecular mechanisms underlying its protective function are not fully understood.

The I/R brain injury was induced by the established rat transient middle cerebral artery occlusion model. We found intraperitoneal injection of melatonin can ameliorate rat brain injury as evidenced by multiple morphological and behavioral criteria, such as infarct size, neurological score, serum creatine kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase content, as well as pyknotic-positive cells. Further studies revealed that the beneficial effects of melatonin is through targeting the autophagy pathway by inhibiting expression of beclin-1 and conversion of LC3, as well as activating the PI3K/Akt pro-survival pathway. To further confirm this finding, the autophagy pathway was activated by lentiviral mediated beclin-1 delivery and the PI3K/Akt pathway was inhibited by a pharmacological inhibitor, LY294002.

This approval was supported by an effect on the cerebral amyloid plaque load and evidence of cognitive efficacy to be confirmed in post-marketing trials. Other anti-amyloid antibodies are under investigation in phase III (donanemab, lecanemab, gantenerumab) and have shown preliminary evidence of a cognitive benefit in phase II trials. Although these agents target a small segment of patients with mild cognitive impairment due to AD or mild AD dementia, their advent will change the design of future clinical trials both for anti-amyloid and non-amyloid drugs. These changes will promote the selection of patients in clinical trials by amyloid and tau biomarkers that identify patients with appropriate biology and may follow the treatment response to approved amyloid antibodies. The use of these agents creates the opportunity to test combined drug therapies and to conduct comparative assessments with innovative therapies and newly approved drugs available in clinical practice. Blood-based AD biomarkers should be implemented in research and could facilitate the recruitment into clinical trials.

Anti-amyloid monoclonal antibodies can substantially reverse amyloid plaque pathology and may modify the course of the disease by slowing or stopping its clinical progression. Several molecules targeting amyloid have failed in clinical development due to drug-related factors (e.g., treatment-limiting adverse events, low potency, poor brain penetration), study design/methodological issues (e.g., disease stage, lack of AD pathology confirmation), and other factors. The US Food and Drug Administration's approval of aducanumab, an anti-amyloid monoclonal antibody as the first potential disease-modifying therapy for AD, signaled the value of more than 20 years of drug development, adding to the available therapies the first nominal success since cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine were approved. BODY: Here, we review over 2 decades of gantenerumab development in the context of scientific discoveries in the broader AD field. Key learnings from the field were incorporated into the gantenerumab phase 3 program, including confirmed amyloid positivity as an entry criterion, an enriched clinical trial population to ensure measurable clinical decline, data-driven exposure-response models to inform a safe and efficacious dosing regimen, and the use of several blood-based biomarkers. Subcutaneous formulation for more pragmatic implementation was prioritized as a key feature from the beginning of the gantenerumab development program.\nCONCLUSION: The results from the gantenerumab phase 3 programs are expected by the end of 2022 and will add critical information to the collective knowledge on the search for effective AD treatments.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37017737": "PURPOSE: Pittsburgh Compound-B (11C-PiB) and 18F-florbetapir are amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracers that have been used as endpoints in Alzheimer's disease (AD) clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy of anti-A\u03b2 monoclonal antibodies. However, comparing drug effects between and within trials may become complicated if different A\u03b2 radiotracers were used. To study the consequences of using different A\u03b2 radiotracers to measure A\u03b2 clearance, we performed a head-to-head comparison of 11C-PiB and 18F-florbetapir in a Phase 2/3 clinical trial of anti-A\u03b2 monoclonal antibodies.\nMETHODS: Sixty-six mutation-positive participants enrolled in the gantenerumab and placebo arms of the first Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network Trials Unit clinical trial (DIAN-TU-001) underwent both 11C-PiB and 18F-florbetapir PET imaging at baseline and during at least one follow-up visit. For each PET scan, regional standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs), regional Centiloids, a global cortical SUVR, and a global cortical Centiloid value were calculated. Longitudinal changes in SUVRs and Centiloids were estimated using linear mixed models. Differences in longitudinal change between PET radiotracers and between drug arms were estimated using paired and Welch two sample t-tests, respectively. Simulated clinical trials were conducted to evaluate the consequences of some research sites using 11C-PiB while other sites use 18F-florbetapir for A\u03b2 PET imaging.\nRESULTS: In the placebo arm, the absolute rate of longitudinal change measured by global cortical 11C-PiB SUVRs did not differ from that of global cortical 18F-florbetapir SUVRs. In the gantenerumab arm, global cortical 11C-PiB SUVRs decreased more rapidly than global cortical 18F-florbetapir SUVRs. Drug effects were statistically significant across both A\u03b2 radiotracers. In contrast, the rates of longitudinal change measured in global cortical Centiloids did not differ between A\u03b2 radiotracers in either the placebo or gantenerumab arms, and drug effects remained statistically significant. Regional analyses largely recapitulated these global cortical analyses. Across simulated clinical trials, type I error was higher in trials where both A\u03b2 radiotracers were used versus trials where only one A\u03b2 radiotracer was used. Power was lower in trials where 18F-florbetapir was primarily used versus trials where 11C-PiB was primarily used.\nCONCLUSION: Gantenerumab treatment induces longitudinal changes in A\u03b2 PET, and the absolute rates of these longitudinal changes differ significantly between A\u03b2 radiotracers. These differences were not seen in the placebo arm, suggesting that A\u03b2-clearing treatments may pose unique challenges when attempting to compare longitudinal results across different A\u03b2 radiotracers. Our results suggest converting A\u03b2 PET SUVR measurements to Centiloids (both globally and regionally) can harmonize these differences without losing sensitivity to drug effects. Nonetheless, until consensus is achieved on how to harmonize drug effects across radiotracers, and since using multiple radiotracers in the same trial may increase type I error, multisite studies should consider potential variability due to different radiotracers when interpreting A\u03b2 PET biomarker data and, if feasible, use a single radiotracer for the best results.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01760005.

Specifically, we discussed randomized clinical trials in subjects with Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis bearing pathogenic gene mutations, and glucocerebrosidase-associated Parkinson's disease. Learning potential lessons to improve future therapeutic approaches is the aim of this review. Two long-term, controlled trials on three anti-\u03b2-amyloid monoclonal antibodies (solanezumab, gantenerumab and crenezumab) in subjects carrying Alzheimer's disease-linked mutated genes encoding for amyloid precursor protein or presenilin 1 or presenilin 2 failed to show cognitive or functional benefits. A major trial on tominersen, an antisense oligonucleotide designed to reduce the production of the huntingtin protein in subjects with Huntington's disease, was prematurely interrupted because the drug failed to show higher efficacy than placebo and, at highest doses, led to worsened outcomes. A 28-week trial of tofersen, an antisense oligonucleotide for superoxide dismutase 1 in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with superoxide dismutase 1 gene mutations failed to show significant beneficial effects but the 1-year open label extension of this study indicated better clinical and functional outcomes in the group with early tofersen therapy. A trial of venglustat, a potent and brain-penetrant glucosylceramide synthase inhibitor, in Parkinson's disease subjects with heterozygous glucocerebrosidase gene mutations revealed worsened clinical and cognitive performance of patients on the enzyme inhibitor compared to placebo. We concluded that clinical trials in neurodegenerative diseases with a genetic basis should test monoclonal antibodies, antisense oligonucleotides or gene editing directed against the mutated enzyme or the mutated substrate without dramatically affecting physiological wild-type variants.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36281062": "Despite considerable investment into potential therapeutic approaches for Alzheimer's disease (AD), currently approved treatment options are limited. Predictive modeling using quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) can be used to guide the design of clinical trials in AD. This study developed a QSP model representing amyloid beta (A\u03b2) pathophysiology in AD. The model included mechanisms of A\u03b2 monomer production and aggregation to form insoluble fibrils and plaques; the transport of soluble species between the compartments of brain, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and plasma; and the pharmacokinetics, transport, and binding of monoclonal antibodies to targets in the three compartments. Ordinary differential equations were used to describe these processes quantitatively. The model components were calibrated to data from the literature and internal studies, including quantitative data supporting the underlying AD biology and clinical data from clinical trials for anti-A\u03b2 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) aducanumab, crenezumab, gantenerumab, and solanezumab. The model was developed for an apolipoprotein E (APOE) \u025b4 allele carrier and tested for an APOE \u025b4 noncarrier. Results indicate that the model is consistent with data on clinical A\u03b2 accumulation in untreated individuals and those treated with monoclonal antibodies, capturing increases in A\u03b2 load accurately. This model may be used to investigate additional AD mechanisms and their impact on biomarkers, as well as predict A\u03b2 load at different dose levels for mAbs with known targets and binding affinities. This model may facilitate the design of scientifically enriched and efficient clinical trials by enabling a priori prediction of biomarker dynamics in the brain and CSF.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37823427": "BACKGROUND: Congenital fibrinogen deficiencies (CFD) are a group of rare bleeding disorders (RBD).

From the first clinical description of afibrinogenemia in 1920, many major achievements have contributed to a better understanding of these complex disorders. The finding of causative mutations in all three fibrinogen genes has contributed to reveal the molecular mechanisms involved in biosynthesis of the fibrinogen molecule and to clarify the basic processes of fibrin polymerization and fibrinolysis. The compilation of abundant cases with detailed genetic, biological, and clinical features has enabled the classification of congenital fibrinogen disorders into several types and subtypes. Thus, the recent classification of congenital fibrinogen disorder is based not only on the clottable and antigenic fibrinogen levels but also on the patient's clinical phenotype and genotype. Fibrinogen supplementation is the cornerstone of bleeding management in fibrinogen disorders. Since the discovery of blood fractionation, the method of production of fibrinogen concentrate has been progressively modified to significantly improve purity and safety. Nevertheless, the availability of such products is still limited to a few countries and the optimal threshold of fibrinogen to target is still not established. In this review, we describe the major advances that have characterized 100 years of congenital fibrinogen disorders, focusing on afibrinogenemia and dysfibrinogenemia.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35853369": "Ranging from bleeding to thrombosis, the clinical features of congenital fibrinogen qualitative disorders, including dysfibrinogenemia and hypodysfibrinogenemia, are highly heterogeneous. Although the associations between some specific fibrinogen mutations and the thrombotic phenotypes have been well elucidated, the underlying mechanism between fibrinogen variants and bleeding events remains underestimated. After systematically reviewing the literature of (hypo-)dysfibrinogenemia patients with bleeding phenotypes, we identified several well-characterized bleeding-related fibrinogen variants in those patients. Several possible pathomechanisms are proposed to explain the genotype-phenotype associations: 1, mutations in the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal portion of the A\u03b1 chain hamper fibrinogen fitting into the active site cleft of thrombin and drastically slow the conversion of fibrinogen into monomeric fibrin; 2, mutations adding new N-linked glycosylation sites introduce bulky and negatively charged carbohydrate side chains and undermine the alignment of fibrin monomers during polymerization; 3, mutations generating unpaired cysteine form extra disulfide bonds between the abnormal fibrinogen chains and produce highly branched and fragile fibrin networks; 4, truncation mutations in the fibrinogen \u03b1C regions impair the lateral fibril aggregation, as well as factor XIII crosslinking, endothelial cell and platelet binding. These established relationships between specific variants and the bleeding tendency will help manage (hypo-)dysfibrinogenemia patients to avoid adverse bleeding outcomes.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35821906": "UNLABELLED: Fibrinogen deficiencies are very rare. Qualitative fibrinogen deficiencies (dysfibrinogenaemia and hypodysfibrinogenemia) are functional disorders that can present with both haemorrhagic symptoms and with thrombotic phenomena as unique and paradoxical manifestation. We present the case of a 77-year-old man being investigated for a partially thrombosed abdominal aortic aneurysm as well as an ischaemic stroke 20 years previously. Basic coagulation tests were normal but extended tests revealed a lengthened thrombin time (TT) combined with a significant drop in fibrinogen concentration measured with the Clauss assay and by nephelometry. After secondary fibrinogen deficiencies were ruled out, a heterozygous variant in the FGG gene was detected by next-generation sequencing, and congenital hypodysfibrinogenemia was diagnosed. Acenocumarol was initiated and no new thrombotic or haemorrhagic events had occurred after a year of follow-up. In almost 25% of cases, thrombotic events may be the only clinical manifestation of functional fibrinogen deficiencies. They are a rare cause of thrombophilia, and are probably underdiagnosed due to normal standard coagulation test results as well as a possible absence of haemorrhagic events. Consequently, a TT test (an initial 'rule out' test) should be requested in order to promptly identify these patients. Moreover, discrepancies in derived and Clauss fibrinogen test results should suggest a functional disorder. Finally, new coagulation techniques based on the functional characterization of clot formation, such as ROTEM or thrombin generation assay, could help characterize these entities and suggest new therapeutic approaches.\nLEARNING POINTS: Functional fibrinogen deficiencies can present with thrombotic manifestations only, and are a rare and probably underdiagnosed cause of thrombophilia.Thrombin time is a highly sensitive test to rule out other conditions as aPTT and PT results may be within normal ranges, especially in functional deficiencies.Discrepancies between derived and Clauss fibrinogen findings, fibrinogen protein measurements and the use of new techniques (ROTEM or thrombin generation) are important for correct approach.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35207353": "Congenital fibrinogen disorders are diseases associated with a bleeding tendency; however, there are also reports of thrombotic events. Fibrinogen plays a role in the pathogenesis of thrombosis due to altered plasma concentrations or modifications to fibrinogen's structural properties, which affect clot permeability, resistance to lysis, and its stiffness. Several distinct types of genetic change and pathogenetic mechanism have been described in patients with bleeding and a thrombotic phenotype, including mutations affecting synthesis or processing in three fibrinogen genes. In this paper, we focused on familial hypofibrinogenemia, a rare inherited quantitative fibrinogen disorder characterized by decreased fibrinogen levels with a high phenotypic heterogeneity. To begin, we briefly review the basic information regarding fibrinogen's structure, its function, and the clinical consequences of low fibrinogen levels. Thereafter, we introduce 15 case reports with various gene mutations derived from the fibrinogen mutation database GFHT (French Study Group on Hemostasis and Thrombosis), which are associated with congenital hypofibrinogenemia with both bleeding and thrombosis. Predicting clinical presentations based on genotype data is difficult. Genotype-phenotype correlations would be of help to better understand the pathologic properties of this rare disease and to provide a valuable tool for the identification of patients who are not only at risk of bleeding, but also at risk of a thrombotic event.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25617013": "Thalidomide is resurging in the management of adult rheumatologic skin conditions, especially lupus erythematosus.

NF-\u03baB is retained in the cytoplasm with I\u03baB\u03b1, and is activated by a wide variety of inflammatory stimuli including TNF, IL-1 and endotoxin followed by its translocation to the nucleus.

Thalidomide is currently under investigation for the treatment of a wide variety of diseases, including conditions thought to have an inflammatory or immune basis, malignancies and complications of infection with HIV. Interest in the potential anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory and anti- angiogenic effects of thalidomide has resulted in off-label use of prescription thalidomide. During the first 18 months of spontaneous postmarketing adverse event surveillance for Thalomid, 1210 spontaneous postmarketing adverse event reports were received for patients treated with prescription thalidomide for all therapeutic indications, including off-label use. The most common adverse events spontaneously reported would have been expected on the basis of the current Thalomid labelling/product information. The current labelling/product information reflects what was known about the risks associated with thalidomide therapy in limited patient populations at the time of the approval of Thalomid. With the postmarketing use of thalidomide in populations other than patients with ENL, it becomes increasingly important to identify patient groups that may be particularly susceptible to specific adverse drug effects and to identify conditions under which specific adverse events may be more likely to occur. Oncology patients may represent a patient population with increased susceptibility to thalidomide-associated adverse effects, including thromboembolic events. Consideration of the spontaneous postmarketing safety surveillance data may help to identify and characterise factors associated with increased risk in this and other patient groups. Serious unexpected adverse events reported with sufficient frequency to signal previously undetected product-event associations for which there may potentially be plausible evidence to suggest a causal relationship have included seizures and Stevens-Johnson syndrome. The potential effects of thalidomide on wound healing are also being closely monitored. Premarketing human clinical trials of drug products are inherently limited in their ability to detect adverse events.

Most patients are asymptomatic, some may present with gastrointestinal hemorrhage or intestinal obstruction. Symptomatic larger lesions leading to bleeding or obstruction should be excised either endoscopically or surgically. Whether it is safe and effective that removing a BGH measuring about 7\u2009cm by HSP is not known.\nCASE PRESENTATION: Here, we reported a rare case of a proximal duodenum pedunculated mass measuring about 7\u2009cm which was responsible for the patient's severe anemia. we treated it as a pedunculated polyp. After being pretreated the stalk with an endoloop which was placed around the base of the mass to prevent post-polypectomy bleeding (PPB), the pedunculated BGH was removed by HSP completely. The stalk of the mass was negative.

Paediatric data, however, remain extremely scarce.\nMETHODS: We conducted a prospective observational study of children (0-18\u00a0years) receiving APD with cloud-based RPM over two 24-week periods (pre- and post-RPM). Primary outcomes were unplanned hospitalizations and fluid management. Children receiving APD without RPM (non-RPM) were included as control.\nRESULTS: Seven patients (6 females) receiving APD were enrolled in the RPM programme at 11.3\u00a0years (IQR 2.6-17.1). Main indications for RPM included history of fluid overload (n\u2009=\u20093) and non-adherence (n\u2009=\u20092). Ten children were included in the non-RPM group (6 females; 16.9\u00a0years, IQR 12.8-17.6). Four patients (57.1%, 95% CI 22.5-100%) experienced fewer unplanned hospitalizations and 5 patients (71.4%, 95% CI 34.1-100%) had shorter hospital stays during the post-RPM period. The hospitalization rates and length of stay were reduced by 45% and 42%, respectively. The higher hospitalization rates among the RPM group, compared to the non-RPM group, were no longer observed following implementation of RPM. There was a significant increase in ultrafiltration (565.6\u2009\u00b1\u2009248.7 vs. 501.7\u2009\u00b1\u2009286.6\u00a0ml/day, p\u2009=\u20090.03) and reduction in systolic blood pressure (114.1\u2009\u00b1\u200912.6 vs. 119.9\u2009\u00b1\u200911.19\u00a0mmHg, p\u2009=\u20090.02) during the post-RPM period. All patients demonstrated satisfactory adherence. Although quality of life (PedsQL 3.0 ESRD module) was not different pre- and post-RPM, all patients agreed in the questionnaires that the use of RPM improved their quality of life and sense of security.\nCONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, RPM in children receiving APD is associated with fewer and shorter unplanned hospitalizations, improved fluid management and favourable adherence to PD.

We present guidelines for dialysis initiation, modality selection, small solute clearance, and fluid removal in children on PD. A review of the literature and key studies that support these statements are presented.\nMETHODS: An extensive Medline search for all publications on PD in children was performed using predefined search criteria.\nRESULTS: High-quality randomized trials in children are scarce and current clinical practice largely relies on data extrapolated from adult studies or drawn from observational cohort studies in children. The evidence and strength of the recommendation is GRADE-ed, but in the absence of high-quality evidence, the opinion of the authors is provided and must be carefully considered by the treating physician, and adapted to local expertise and individual patient needs as appropriate. We discuss the timing of dialysis initiation, factors to be considered when selecting a dialysis modality, the assessment and management of volume status on PD, achieving optimal small solute clearance, and the importance of preserving residual kidney function. While optimal dialysis must remain the goal for every patient, a careful discussion with fully informed patients and caregivers is important to understand the patient and family's expectations of dialysis and reasonable adjustments to the dialysis program may be considered in accordance with a philosophy of shared decision-making.\nCONCLUSIONS: There continues to be very poor evidence in the field of chronic PD in children and these recommendations can at best serve to guide clinical decision-making.

Hemodialysis (HD) is used less often due to the technical challenges and risk of complications in smaller patients. There are limited data on chronic HD in this patient population.\nMETHODS: This was a retrospective study of children younger than 24\u00a0months on HD and PD in the North American Pediatric Renal Trials and Collaborative Studies (NAPRTCS) registry between January 1992 and December 2018. We compared demographic, clinical, and laboratory data and outcomes, including patient survival and kidney transplantation.\nRESULTS: We identified 1125 infants and toddlers younger than 2\u00a0years of age who initiated KRT from January 1992 to December 2018. Of those, 1011 (89.8%) initiated peritoneal dialysis and 114 (10.2%) initiated hemodialysis. Median (IQR) age at HD onset was 12 (5.6-18.7) months compared to 4.6 (0.8-11.7) months at PD onset (p\u2009<\u20090.001). The primary cause of kidney failure with replacement therapy was congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (56.2% of PD versus 39.5% of HD group). Patients on HD had superior growth and nutrition markers than those on PD. Patient survival was similar between the two groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: While HD may not be the modality of choice for chronic KRT in younger children, 10% of children younger than 24\u00a0months of age receive maintenance HD and the numbers have increased over time.

Amyloid b<sub>1-42</sub> (A\u03b2) has been the main target of experimental therapies, based on evidence of the neurotoxic effects of A\u03b2, and of the potential adverse effects of brain A\u03b2\u00a0burden detected in humans in vivo by positron emission tomography (PET). Progress on passive anti-amyloid immunotherapy research includes identification of antibodies that facilitate microglial activation, catalytical disaggregation, and increased flow of A\u03b2\u00a0from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to plasma, thus decreasing the neurotoxic effects of A\u03b2. Recently completed phase 2 and 3 trials of 3rd generation anti-amyloid immunotherapies are supportive of their clinical efficacy in reducing brain A\u03b2\u00a0burden and preventing cognitive decline. Data from recent trials implicate these agents as the first effective disease-modifying therapies against AD and has led to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recent approval of aducanumab and lecanemab, under an accelerated approval pathway. The clinical effects of these agents are modest, however, and associated with amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA).

At the time of writing, two amyloid-lowering antibodies, aducanumab and lecanemab, have obtained United States Food and Drug Administration accelerated approval, with further agents of this class in the Alzheimer's disease treatment pipeline. Based on limited published clinical trial data to date, regulators, payors and physicians will need to assess their efficacy, clinical effectiveness and safety, as well as cost and accessibility. We propose that attention to three important questions related to treatment efficacy, clinical effectiveness and safety should guide evidence-based consideration of this important class of drugs. These are: (1) Were trial statistical analyses appropriate and did they convincingly support claims of efficacy? (2) Do reported treatment effects outweigh safety concerns and are they generalizable to a representative clinical population of people with Alzheimer's disease? and (3) Do the data convincingly demonstrate disease course modification, suggesting that increasing clinical benefits beyond the duration of the trials are likely? We suggest specific approaches to interpreting trial results for these drugs and highlight important areas of uncertainty where additional data and a cautious interpretation of existing results is warranted. Safe, effective and accessible treatments for Alzheimer's disease are eagerly awaited by millions of patients and their caregivers worldwide. While amyloid-targeting immunotherapies may be promising disease-modifying Alzheimer's disease treatments, rigorous and unbiased assessment of clinical trial data is critical to regulatory decision-making and subsequently determining their provision and utility in routine clinical practice.

Two antibodies, donanemab and lecanemab, have demonstrated clinical efficacy, but these results remain uncertain. We further argue that the decreased amyloid PET signal in these trials is unlikely to be a one-to-one reflection of amyloid removal, but rather a reflection of increased therapy-related brain damage, as supported by the increased incidence of ARIAs and reported loss of brain volume. Due to these uncertainties of benefit and risk, we recommend that the FDA pauses existing approvals and approval of new antibodies until results of phase 4 studies with these drugs are available to inform on these risk-benefit uncertainties. We recommend that the FDA prioritize FDG PET and detection of ARIAs and accelerated brain volume loss with MRI in all trial patients, and neuropathological examination of all patients who die in these phase 4 trials.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37334596": "After the CLARITY-AD clinical trial results of lecanemab were interpreted as positive, and supporting the amyloid hypothesis, the drug received accelerated Food and Drug Administration approval.

We note potential biases from inclusion, unblinding, dropouts, and other issues.

Appropriate Use Recommendations (AURs) are intended to help guide the introduction of new therapies into real-world clinical practice. Community dwelling patients with AD differ from those participating in clinical trials. Administration of lecanemab at clinical trial sites by individuals experienced with monoclonal antibody therapy also differs from the community clinic-based administration of lecanemab. These AURs use clinical trial data as well as research and care information regarding AD to help clinicians administer lecanemab with optimal safety and opportunity for effectiveness. Safety and efficacy of lecanemab are known only for patients like those participating in the phase 2 and phase 3 lecanemab trials, and these AURs adhere closely to the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the trials. Adverse events may occur with lecanemab including amyloid related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) and infusion reactions. Monitoring guidelines for these events are detailed in this AUR. Most ARIA with lecanemab is asymptomatic, but a few cases are serious or, very rarely, fatal. Microhemorrhages and rare macrohemorrhages may occur in patients receiving lecanemab. Anticoagulation increases the risk of hemorrhage, and the AUR recommends that patients requiring anticoagulants not receive lecanemab until more data regarding this interaction are available. Patients who are apolipoprotein E \u03b54 (APOE4) gene carriers, especially APOE4 homozygotes, are at higher risk for ARIA, and the AUR recommends APOE genotyping to better inform risk discussions with patients who are lecanemab candidates. Clinician and institutional preparedness are mandatory for use of lecanemab, and protocols for management of serious events should be developed and implemented. Communication between clinicians and therapy candidates or those on therapy is a key element of good clinical practice for the use of lecanemab.

Randomisation was stratified by AChR and MuSK autoantibody status. Investigators, patients, and people assessing outcomes were masked to random assignments. The primary efficacy endpoint was change from baseline to day 43 in MG-ADL score, assessed in the intention-to-treat population. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were assessed in all randomly assigned patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03971422) and EudraCT (2019-000968-18); an open-label extension study has been completed (NCT04124965; EudraCT 2019-000969-21) and another is underway (NCT04650854; EudraCT 2020-003230-20).\nFINDINGS: Between June 3, 2019, and June 30, 2021, 300 patients were assessed for eligibility, of whom 200 were enrolled. 66 (33%) were randomly assigned to rozanolixizumab 7 mg/kg, 67 (34%) to rozanolixizumab 10 mg/kg, and 67 (34%) to placebo. Reductions in MG-ADL score from baseline to day 43 were greater in the rozanolixizumab 7 mg/kg group (least-squares mean change -3\u00b737 [SE 0\u00b749]) and in the rozanolixizumab 10 mg/kg group (-3\u00b740 [0\u00b749]) than with placebo (-0\u00b778 [0\u00b749]; for 7 mg/kg, least-squares mean difference -2\u00b759 [95% CI -4\u00b709 to -1\u00b725], p<0\u00b70001; for 10 mg/kg, -2\u00b762 [-3\u00b799 to -1\u00b716], p<0\u00b70001). TEAEs were experienced by 52 (81%) of 64 patients treated with rozanolixizumab 7 mg/kg, 57 (83%) of 69 treated with rozanolixizumab 10 mg/kg, and 45 (67%) of 67 treated with placebo. The most frequent TEAEs were headache (29 [45%] patients in the rozanolixizumab 7 mg/kg group, 26 [38%] in the rozanolixizumab 10 mg/kg group, and 13 [19%] in the placebo group), diarrhoea (16 [25%], 11 [16%], and nine [13%]), and pyrexia (eight [13%], 14 [20%], and one [1%]). Five (8%) patients in the rozanolixizumab 7 mg/kg group, seven (10%) in the rozanolixizumab 10 mg/kg group, and six (9%) in the placebo group had a serious TEAE. No deaths occurred.\nINTERPRETATION: Rozanolixizumab showed clinically meaningful improvements in patient-reported and investigator-assessed outcomes in patients with generalised myasthenia gravis, for both 7 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg doses. Both doses were generally well tolerated. These findings support the mechanism of action of neonatal Fc receptor inhibition in generalised myasthenia gravis. Rozanolixizumab represents a potential additional treatment option for patients with generalised myasthenia gravis.\nFUNDING: UCB Pharma.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37287352": "Since the discovery of a series of antineuronal surface antibodies (NSAs), the diagnostic approach and management of patients with autoimmune encephalitis (AE) and related disorders have undergone a \"paradigm shift.\" However, recent topics described below are also announcing the dawn of the next era in the practice of patients with AE.

Our objective was to explore how MG severity can be measured and to determine how the newly developed MG Symptoms Patient-Reported Outcome (PRO) instrument complements the available measures of MG severity.\nMETHODS: The conceptual coverage of the Quantitative MG (QMG), MG Composite (MGC), MG-Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL), and MG Symptoms PRO was scrutinized against core symptoms of MG: muscle weakness in three muscle groups (ocular, bulbar, and respiratory), muscle weakness fatigability, and physical fatigue. Post hoc analyses of the MG0002 study, a Phase 2a clinical trial of rozanolixizumab in adults with moderate to severe generalized MG, included correlation and Rasch model analyses.\nRESULTS: The qualitative appraisal highlighted that only the MG Symptoms PRO captured physical fatigue. Data from 541 assessments (43 unique patients) were used for the analyses. Correlations ranged between 0.56 and 0.74 for the MG-ADL, QMG, MGC, and MG Symptoms PRO Muscle Weakness Fatigability score, and between 0.20 and 0.71 for the MG Symptoms PRO scores focusing on independent muscle groups. Analyses with the Rasch model estimated a meaningful continuum of severity of MG, including all items, except ocular muscles, from the four instruments. The QMG and MG Symptoms PRO had the broadest coverage of the MG severity continuum. Muscle fatigability and physical fatigue were more characteristic of low severity while bulbar weakness indicated more severe MG.\nCONCLUSION: The severity of MG can be reflected in a meaningful continuum underpinned by the MG-specific outcome measures. Only ocular muscle manifestations were shown to reflect a possibly different facet of MG severity. With its modular nature and comprehensive content, the MG Symptoms PRO provides complementary information to the outcome measures widely used in MG.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03052751.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37602255": "Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by autoantibodies specifically directed against proteins located within the postsynaptic membrane of the neuromuscular junction. These pathogenic autoantibodies can be reduced by therapies such as plasma exchange, IVIG infusions and other immunosuppressive agents. However, there are significant side effects associated with most of these therapies. Since there is a better understanding of the molecular structure and the biological properties of the neonatal Fc receptors (FcRn), it possesses an attractive profile in treating myasthenia gravis. FcRn receptors prevent the catabolism of IgG by impeding their lysosomal degradation and facilitating their extracellular release at physiological pH, consequently extending the IgG half-life. Thus, the catabolism of IgG can be enhanced by blocking the FcRn, leading to outcomes similar to those achieved through plasma exchange with no significant safety concerns. The available studies suggest that FcRn holds promise as a versatile therapeutic intervention, capable of delivering beneficial outcomes in patients with distinct characteristics and varying degrees of MG severity. Efgartigimod is already approved for the treatment of generalized MG, rozanolixizumab is under review by health authorities, and phase 3 trials of nipocalimab and batoclimab are underway.

Initial therapy with FOLFOXIRI-bevacizumab is superior to doublets plus bevacizumab independently from primary tumor sidedness and RAS/BRAF status. No randomized comparison between FOLFOXIRI-bevacizumab versus doublets plus anti-EGFRs is available in left-sided RAS/BRAF wild-type mCRC.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: We selected patients with left-sided RAS and BRAF wild-type mCRC treated with first-line FOLFOX-panitumumab or FOLFOXIRI-bevacizumab in five randomized trials: Valentino, TRIBE, TRIBE2, STEAM, and CHARTA. A propensity score-based analysis was performed to compare FOLFOXIRI-bevacizumab with FOLFOX-panitumumab.\nRESULTS: A total of 185 patients received FOLFOX-panitumumab and 132 received FOLFOXIRI-bevacizumab. Median progression-free survival (PFS) and median overall survival (OS) were 13.3 and 33.1 months in the FOLFOXIRI-bevacizumab group compared with 11.4 and 30.3 months in the FOLFOX-panitumumab group (propensity score-adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for PFS, 0.82; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.64-1.04; p = .11; propensity score-adjusted HR for OS, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.59-1.08; p = .14). No significant differences in overall response rate and disease control rate were observed. A statistically nonsignificant difference in favor of FOLFOXIRI-bevacizumab was observed for OS after secondary resection of metastases. Chemotherapy-related adverse events were more frequent in the FOLFOXIRI-bevacizumab group, with specific regard to grade 3 and 4 neutropenia (48% vs. 26%, adjusted p = .001).\nCONCLUSION: Although randomized comparison is lacking, both FOLFOXIRI-bevacizumab and FOLFOX-panitumumab are valuable treatment options in left-sided RAS/BRAF wild-type mCRC.\nIMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: A propensity score-based analysis of five trials was performed to compare FOLFOX-panitumumab versus FOLFOXIRI-bevacizumab in left-sided RAS/BRAF wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). No significant differences were observed, but FOLFOXIRI-bevacizumab achieved numerically superior survival outcomes versus FOLFOX-panitumumab. Chemotherapy-related adverse events were more frequent in the FOLFOXIRI-bevacizumab group. These observations suggest that although doublet chemotherapy plus anti-EGFRs remains the preferred treatment in patients with left-sided RAS/BRAF wild-type mCRC, FOLFOXIRI-bevacizumab is a valuable option able to provide similar, if not better, outcomes at the price of a moderate increase in toxicity and may be adopted based on patients' preference and potential impact on quality of life.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33539032": "This commentary focuses on the results of the study by Pietrantonio et al., which evaluated the clinical conundrum of triplet versus doublet chemotherapy in combination with targeted therapy for metastatic left-sided RAS/BRAF wild-type colorectal cancer and appears in this issue.

However, the substantial cost increase and economic impact of using cetuximab imposes a considerable burden on patients and society.\nMETHODS: A Markov model based on the data collected in the FIRE-3 trial was developed to investigate the cost-effectiveness of treating patients with FOLFIRI plus either cetuximab or bevacizumab from the perspective of the Chinese health-care system. Costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were calculated over a lifetime horizon. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed by varying potentially modifiable parameters.\nRESULTS: In our analysis, the total treatment costs in the bevacizumab and cetuximab groups were $92 549.31 and $94 987.31, respectively, and the QALYs gained were 1.58 and 2.05. In the base-case analysis, compared with bevacizumab, left-sided RAS WT patients receiving cetuximab gained 0.47 more QALYs at an ICER of $5187.23/QALY ($3166.23/LY).

The LBD group exhibited the most A\u03b2 deposition in the temporal cortex and striatum (90/76%, respectively), followed by PSP (69/28%), FTLD-TDP (50/25%), and the MSA group (50/10%). We conducted immunohistochemical analysis using antibodies targeting eight A\u03b2 epitopes in the LBD and PSP groups. Immunohistochemical findings were evaluated semi-quantitatively and quantitatively using digital pathology. Females with LBD exhibited significantly more severe A\u03b2 deposition, particularly A\u03b2<sub>42</sub> and A\u03b2<sub>43</sub> , along with significantly more severe tau pathology. Furthermore, a quantitative analysis of all A\u03b2 peptides in the LBD group revealed an association with the APOE-\u03b54 genotypes.

If amyloid-\u03b2 is crucial to the development of Alzheimer's disease, it should be associated with other Alzheimer's disease-like neurological changes. This review examines whether amyloid-\u03b2 is associated with other biomarkers indicative of early Alzheimer's disease in normal older people. The preponderance of evidence links amyloid-\u03b2 to functional change, progressive brain atrophy, and cognitive decline. Individuals at greatest risk of decline seem to be those with evidence of both amyloid-\u03b2 and findings suggestive of neurodegeneration.

The amyloid cascade hypothesis defines soluble amyloid-\u03b2 oligomers, consisting of multiple amyloid-\u03b2 monomers, as precursors of insoluble amyloid-\u03b2 plaques. Dissecting the biological effects of single amyloid-\u03b2 oligomers, for example of amyloid-\u03b2 dimers, an abundant amyloid-\u03b2 oligomer associated with clinical progression of Alzheimer's disease, has been difficult due to the inability to control the kinetics of amyloid-\u03b2 multimerization. For investigating the biological effects of amyloid-\u03b2 dimers, we stabilized amyloid-\u03b2 dimers by an intermolecular disulphide bridge via a cysteine mutation in the amyloid-\u03b2 peptide (A\u03b2-S8C) of the amyloid precursor protein. This construct was expressed as a recombinant protein in cells and in a novel transgenic mouse, termed tgDimer mouse. This mouse formed constant levels of highly synaptotoxic soluble amyloid-\u03b2 dimers, but not monomers, amyloid-\u03b2 plaques or insoluble amyloid-\u03b2 during its lifespan. Accordingly, neither signs of neuroinflammation, tau hyperphosphorylation or cell death were observed. Nevertheless, these tgDimer mice did exhibit deficits in hippocampal long-term potentiation and age-related impairments in learning and memory, similar to what was observed in classical Alzheimer's disease mouse models. Although the amyloid-\u03b2 dimers were unable to initiate the formation of insoluble amyloid-\u03b2 aggregates in tgDimer mice, after crossbreeding tgDimer mice with the CRND8 mouse, an amyloid-\u03b2 plaque generating mouse model, A\u03b2-S8C dimers were sequestered into amyloid-\u03b2 plaques, suggesting that amyloid-\u03b2 plaques incorporate neurotoxic amyloid-\u03b2 dimers that by themselves are unable to self-assemble. Our results suggest that within the fine interplay between different amyloid-\u03b2 species, amyloid-\u03b2 dimer neurotoxic signalling, in the absence of amyloid-\u03b2 plaque pathology, may be involved in causing early deficits in synaptic plasticity, learning and memory that accompany Alzheimer's disease.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32093040": "The term \"amyloid\" refers to proteinaceous deposits of peptides that might be generated from larger precursor proteins e.g., by proteolysis.

Association between lactate indices- lactate at 0 hours (Lac0), lactate after 6 hours (Lac6), time-weighted average (LacTW), delta (\u0394Lac), clearance (LacCl%) and early mortality, need for vasopressors, and mechanical ventilation-was assessed using Student t test/Mann-Whitney test. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) for early mortality deduced for all lactate indices and compared with reference (Lac0). Optimal cutoffs (maximizing both sensitivity and specificity) and their positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were determined.\nRESULTS: During the study period, 116 children were assessed. Septic shock was present at admission in 56.9% children; 50% of children died during the next 48 hours. Lac0, Lac6, and LacTW were significantly higher, and LacCl% was lower in nonsurvivors versus survivors (all P &lt; .001). Lac6 (0.837 [0.76-0.91]) had significantly higher AUROC (95% confidence interval) than Lac0 (0.77; P = .03). Abnormal lactate metrics (higher Lac0, Lac6, LacTW, and lower LacCl%) were associated with vasopressors need and mechanical ventilation. On logistic regression, Lac6 emerged as an independent predictor of early mortality as well as vasopressor and mechanical ventilation need. The optimal cutoff of Lac6 for identifying early mortality with good sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV was \u22652.65 (76, 85, 83, 78).\nCONCLUSIONS: Lactate6 is the best marker associated with early mortality and higher level of care in severe sepsis/septic shock in resource-poor regions.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28068437": "IMPORTANCE: Improving emergency care of pediatric sepsis is a public health priority, but optimal early diagnostic approaches are unclear. Measurement of lactate levels is associated with improved outcomes in adult septic shock, but pediatric guidelines do not endorse its use, in part because the association between early lactate levels and mortality is unknown in pediatric sepsis.\nOBJECTIVE: To determine whether the initial serum lactate level is associated with 30-day mortality in children with suspected sepsis.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This observational cohort study of a clinical registry of pediatric patients with suspected sepsis in the emergency department of a tertiary children's hospital from April 1, 2012, to December 31, 2015, tested the hypothesis that a serum lactate level of greater than 36 mg/dL is associated with increased mortality compared with a serum lactate level of 36 mg/dL or less. Consecutive patients with sepsis were identified and included in the registry following consensus guidelines for clinical recognition (infection and decreased mental status or perfusion). Among 2520 registry visits, 1221 were excluded for transfer from another medical center, no measurement of lactate levels, and patients younger than 61 days or 18 years or older, leaving 1299 visits available for analysis. Lactate testing is prepopulated in the institutional sepsis order set but may be canceled at clinical discretion.\nEXPOSURES: Venous lactate level of greater than 36 mg/dL on the first measurement within the first 8 hours after arrival.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Thirty-day in-hospital mortality was the primary outcome. Odds ratios were calculated using logistic regression to account for potential confounders.\nRESULTS: Of the 1299 patients included in the analysis (753 boys [58.0%] and 546 girls [42.0%]; mean [SD] age, 7.3 [5.3] years), 899 (69.2%) had chronic medical conditions and 367 (28.3%) had acute organ dysfunction. Thirty-day mortality occurred in 5 of 103 patients (4.8%) with lactate levels greater than 36 mg/dL and 20 of 1196 patients (1.7%) with lactate levels of 36 mg/dL or less. Initial lactate levels of greater than 36 mg/dL were significantly associated with 30-day mortality in unadjusted (odds ratio, 3.00; 95% CI, 1.10-8.17) and adjusted (odds ratio, 3.26; 95% CI, 1.16- 9.16) analyses. The sensitivity of lactate levels greater than 36 mg/dL for 30-day mortality was 20.0% (95% CI, 8.9%-39.1%), and specificity was 92.3% (90.7%-93.7%).\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In children treated for sepsis in the emergency department, lactate levels greater than 36 mg/dL were associated with mortality but had a low sensitivity.

Aim of the study is Neonatal sepsis refers to infection involving the blood stream in neonates. It is major health problem causing neonatal mortality and morbidity in developing countries. Our study aimed to assess the correlation between lactate clearance and blood lactate levels with outcome of neonatal sepsis.\nMETHODS: Seventy-three eligible neonates recruited with convenience sampling technique. Study was conducted at the Neonatology department, The Children's Hospital & the Institute of Child Health, Lahore. After approval from institutional review board, and informed consent of parents/guardians, neonates with sepsis were selected through a present inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data was collected with the predetermined demographics, inflammatory markers and lactate levels.\nRESULTS: This research revealed 37% (n=27) mortality rate among septic neonates who were having higher blood lactate levels and low lactate clearance at 6 hours of admission in nursery. Hence higher serum lactate levels and low lactate clearance (<10%) at 6 hours were significant predictors of poor outcome in septic neonates (p-Value, <0.05). The lactate level of neonates who could not survive was 5.68\u00b11.22 as compared to who were discharged 4.11\u00b11.14 (p-Value, <0.05).\nCONCLUSIONS: Higher blood lactate levels and lactate clearance of less than 10% at 6 hours of admission in nursery are significant predictors of mortality in neonatal sepsis.

However, HT is still the most effective treatment with safety in early initiation since menopause onset. Nevertheless, it is essential to evaluate the risks of related chronic diseases and customize individualized treatments. Possible estetrol preparations and more types of Tissue Selective Estrogen Complex formulations are potential directions of drug development in the future of HT.

Thus, a new generation of NK3R antagonists has entered clinical development to specifically target the mechanistic basis of VMS. Fezolinetant is the most advanced NK3R antagonist in terms of stage of clinical development. Results to date have demonstrated rapid and substantial reduction in VMS frequency and severity and associated improvements in health-related quality of life.

We performed genomic analysis of intrinsic and acquired resistance to anti-EGFR therapy in prospectively collected tumour samples from 25 CRC patients receiving cetuximab (an EGFR inhibitor). Of 25 CRC patients, 13 displayed intrinsic resistance to cetuximab; 12 were intrinsically sensitive. We obtained six re-biopsy samples at acquired resistance from the intrinsically sensitive patients. NCOA4-RET and LMNA-NTRK1 fusions and NRG1 and GNAS amplifications were found in intrinsic-resistant patients. In cetuximab-sensitive patients, we found KRAS K117N and A146T mutations in addition to BRAF V600E, AKT1 E17K, PIK3CA E542K, and FGFR1 or ERBB2 amplifications. The comparison between baseline and acquired-resistant tumours revealed an extreme shift in variant allele frequency of somatic variants, suggesting that cetuximab exposure dramatically selected for rare resistant subclones that were initially undetectable. There was also an increase in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition at acquired resistance, with a reduction in the immune infiltrate. Furthermore, characterization of an acquired-resistant, patient-derived cell line showed that PI3K/mTOR inhibition could rescue cetuximab resistance. Thus, we uncovered novel genomic alterations that elucidate the mechanisms of sensitivity and resistance to anti-EGFR therapy in metastatic CRC patients.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36117191": "Most colorectal (CRC) tumors are dependent on EGFR/KRAS/BRAF/MAPK signaling activation. ARID1A is an epigenetic regulator mutated in approximately 5% of non-hypermutated CRC tumors.

In addition, we find that patients with ARID1A mutations, at baseline, are associated with worse outcome when treated with cetuximab- but not bevacizumab-containing therapies; thus, this suggests that ARID1A mutations may provide both an acquired and intrinsic mechanism of resistance to anti-EGFR therapies. We find that, ARID1A and EGFR-pathway genetic alterations are mutually exclusive across lung and colorectal cancers, further supporting a functional connection between these pathways. Our results not only suggest that ARID1A could be potentially used as a predictive biomarker for cetuximab treatment decisions but also provide a rationale for exploring therapeutic MAPK inhibition in an unexpected but genetically defined segment of CRC patients.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22722830": "A main limitation of therapies that selectively target kinase signalling pathways is the emergence of secondary drug resistance. Cetuximab, a monoclonal antibody that binds the extracellular domain of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), is effective in a subset of KRAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancers. After an initial response, secondary resistance invariably ensues, thereby limiting the clinical benefit of this drug. The molecular bases of secondary resistance to cetuximab in colorectal cancer are poorly understood. Here we show that molecular alterations (in most instances point mutations) of KRAS are causally associated with the onset of acquired resistance to anti-EGFR treatment in colorectal cancers. Expression of mutant KRAS under the control of its endogenous gene promoter was sufficient to confer cetuximab resistance, but resistant cells remained sensitive to combinatorial inhibition of EGFR and mitogen-activated protein-kinase kinase (MEK). Analysis of metastases from patients who developed resistance to cetuximab or panitumumab showed the emergence of KRAS amplification in one sample and acquisition of secondary KRAS mutations in 60% (6 out of 10) of the cases. KRAS mutant alleles were detectable in the blood of cetuximab-treated patients as early as 10 months before radiographic documentation of disease progression. In summary, the results identify KRAS mutations as frequent drivers of acquired resistance to cetuximab in colorectal cancers, indicate that the emergence of KRAS mutant clones can be detected non-invasively months before radiographic progression and suggest early initiation of a MEK inhibitor as a rational strategy for delaying or reversing drug resistance.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25993166": "Our understanding of the genetic and nongenetic molecular alterations associated with anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) therapy resistance in colorectal cancer (CRC) has markedly expanded in recent years. Mutations in RAS genes (KRAS/NRAS exons 2, 3, or 4) predict a lack of clinical benefit when anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are added to chemotherapy. Genetic events in additional nodes of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways that bypass EGFR signaling, such as BRAF or PIK3CA mutations or KRAS, ERBB2, or MET amplifications, also may confer resistance to cetuximab or panitumumab. Polymorphisms that block antibody binding as a result of EGFR extracellular domain mutations have been reported. Nongenetic mechanisms, including compensatory activation of receptor tyrosine kinases HER3 and MET, together with high expression of the ligands amphiregulin, transforming growth factor alpha heregulin, and hepatocyte growth factor in the tumor microenvironment also are thought to be involved in resistance. In one-third of the samples, more than one genetic event can be found, and nongenetic events most likely coexist with gene alterations. Furthermore, activation of a gene expression signature of epithelial-mesenchymal transition has been associated with reduced cellular dependence on EGFR signaling. Collectively, this body of work provides convincing evidence that the molecular heterogeneity of CRC plays an important role in the context of resistance to anti-EGFR therapy.

Some of them have been validated as targets for therapeutic intervention in clinical trials, such as ERBB2 amplifications.

Individually, PCT showed better accuracy (AUC = 78.7%) followed by hs-CRP (AUC = 78.4%) and sCD14-ST (AUC = 74.8%). Combination of PCT + hs-CRP had the highest accuracy (AUC = 80.1%) followed by hs-CRP + sCD14-ST (AUC = 77.2%), PCT + sCD14-ST + hs-CRP (AUC = 77.0%) and PCT + sCD14-ST (AUC = 75.9%).Conclusion: hs-CRP, PCT, and sCD14-ST are independent predictors of paediatric sepsis due to their high prognostic values. Moreover, Bioscore combination of these biomarkers was significantly associated with increased odds for sepsis.

In this study procalcitonin (PCT) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were evaluated for their diagnostic relevance in neonatal late onset sepsis.\nDESIGN: Clinical study\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: We analysed inflammatory parameters in 48 newborn infants admitted to the Intensive Care Unit of Institute of Paediatrics in Lodz who suffered from nosocomial sepsis. They were sampled for PCT and CRP levels at the time of the onset of signs and 24 hours later. CRP was determined by an nephelometric method and PCT was determined by an immunoluminometric assay.\nRESULTS: At the onset of Gram negative sepsis 14 from 17 contaminated newborns had significantly increased CRP levels and 15 of them had increased levels of PCT After 24 hours 100% of them had elevated PCT and CRP levels. At the onset of Gram positive sepsis only 18 from 31 neonates with positive blood culture had increased CRP levels and 28 of them had elevated concentrations of PCT. This difference was statistically significant.

Patients were classified, when PCT and CRP were measured, into one of six categories (negative, SIRS, localized infection, sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock) according to the definitions of the American College of Chest Physicians /Society of Critical Care Medicine. A total of 359 patient day episodes were obtained. Leucocyte count did not differ across the six diagnostic classes considered. Median plasma PCT concentrations were 0.17, 0.43, 0.79, 1.80, 15.40 and 19.13 ng/ml in negative, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), localized infection, sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock groups, respectively, whereas median plasma CRP concentrations were 1.35, 3.80, 6.45, 5.70, 7.60 and 16.2 mg/dl, respectively. The area under the ROC curve for the diagnosis of septic patients was 0.532 for leucocyte count (95% CI, 0.462-0.602), 0.750 for CRP (95% CI, 0.699-0.802) and 0.912 for PCT (95% CI, 0.882-0.943). We obtained four groups using CRP values and five groups using PCT values that classified a significant percentage of patients according to the severity of the different SIRS groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: PCT is a better diagnostic marker of sepsis in critically ill children than CRP.

The Pediatric Risk of Mortality and Pediatric Index of Mortality II scores were calculated, multivariate analysis was conducted to evaluate the independence of the association between serum lipoprotein and the risk of sepsis on the day of admission. This study involved 88 children (48 with sepsis, 40 non-sepsis). The sepsis group had a lower level of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL). The CRP, white blood cell, and procalcitonin (PCT) were considerably higher than the non-sepsis group. After adjusting for covariates, logistic regression analysis suggested that the CRP, PCT, HDL, Pediatric Risk of Mortality score, Pediatric Index of Mortality II score and LDL were independent risk factors for sepsis. Moreover, the AUC of CRP, PCT, HDL, and LDL were 0.58, 0.76, 0.82, and 0.86, respectively.

Zilebesiran, an investigational RNA interference therapeutic agent with a prolonged duration of action, inhibits hepatic angiotensinogen synthesis.\nMETHODS: In this phase 1 study, patients with hypertension were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive either a single ascending subcutaneous dose of zilebesiran (10, 25, 50, 100, 200, 400, or 800 mg) or placebo and were followed for 24 weeks (Part A). Part B assessed the effect of the 800-mg dose of zilebesiran on blood pressure under low- or high-salt diet conditions, and Part E the effect of that dose when coadministered with irbesartan. End points included safety, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics, and the change from baseline in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, as measured by 24-hour ambulatory blood-pressure monitoring.\nRESULTS: Of 107 patients enrolled, 5 had mild, transient injection-site reactions. There were no reports of hypotension, hyperkalemia, or worsening of renal function resulting in medical intervention. In Part A, patients receiving zilebesiran had decreases in serum angiotensinogen levels that were correlated with the administered dose (r\u2009=\u2009-0.56 at week 8; 95% confidence interval, -0.69 to -0.39). Single doses of zilebesiran (\u2265200 mg) were associated with decreases in systolic blood pressure (>10 mm Hg) and diastolic blood pressure (>5 mm Hg) by week 8; these changes were consistent throughout the diurnal cycle and were sustained at 24 weeks. Results from Parts B and E were consistent with attenuation of the effect on blood pressure by a high-salt diet and with an augmented effect through coadministration with irbesartan, respectively.\nCONCLUSIONS: Dose-dependent decreases in serum angiotensinogen levels and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure were sustained for up to 24 weeks after a single subcutaneous dose of zilebesiran of 200 mg or more; mild injection-site reactions were observed.

A high proportion of hypertensive patients exhibit uncontrolled blood pressure (BP), associated with poor adherence, linked to pill burden and adverse effects. Novel pharmacological strategies are urgently needed to improve BP control. Dysregulation of the renin-angiotensin system increases BP through its primary effector, Ang II (angiotensin II), which results in tissue remodeling and end-organ damage. Silencing liver angiotensinogen (the sole source of Ang II) has been achieved using novel RNA therapeutics, including the antisense oligonucleotide, IONIS-AGT (angiotensinogen)-LR<sub>X</sub>, and the small-interfering RNA, zilebesiran. Conjugation to N-acetylgalactosamine enables targeted delivery to hepatocytes, where endosomal storage, slow leakage, and small-interfering RNA recycling (for zilebesiran) result in knockdown over several months. Indeed, zilebesiran has an impressive and durable effect on systolic BP, reduced by up to 20 mm Hg and sustained for 6 months after a single administration, likely due to its very effective knockdown of angiotensinogen, without causing acute kidney injury or hyperkalemia. By contrast, IONIS-AGT-LR<sub>X</sub> caused less knockdown and marginal effects on BP. Future studies should evaluate any loss of efficacy relating to antidrug antibodies, safety issues associated with long-term angiotensinogen suppression, and broader benefits, especially in the context of common comorbidities such as type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37897397": "INTRODUCTION: Hypertension is the main global risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Despite this, less than half of treated hypertensive patients are controlled. One reason for this is nonadherence, a major unmet need in hypertension pharmacotherapy. Small interfering RNA (small interfering ribonucleic acid) therapies inhibit protein translation, and, when linked to N-acetylgalactosamine, allow liver-specific targeting, and durability over several months. Targeted knockdown of hepatic angiotensinogen, the source of all angiotensins, offers a precision medicine approach.\nAREAS COVERED: This article describes the molecular basis for durability over months and the 24-h tonic target inhibition observed after one administration. We present an analysis of the published phase I trials using zilebesiran, a siRNA targeting hepatic angiotensinogen, which reduces blood pressure (BP) by up to 20\u2009mmHg, lasting 24\u2009weeks. Finally, we examine data evaluating reversibility of angiotensinogen knockdown and its relevance to the future clinical utility of zilebesiran.\nEXPERT OPINION: Further studies should assess safety, efficacy, and outcomes in larger, more broadly representative groups. An advantage of zilebesiran is the potential for bi-annual dosing, thereby reducing nonadherence and improving control rates. It may also reduce nighttime BP due to 24-h tonic control.

Chronic inflammation is the driver of neoplastic progression, resulting in dysplastic precursor lesions that may arise in multiple areas of the colon through a process of field cancerization. Colitis-associated CRC shares many molecular similarities with sporadic CRC, and preclinical investigations have demonstrated a potential role for the microbiome in concert with the host immune system in the development of colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CAC). Some unique molecular differences occur in CAC, but their role in the pathogenesis and behavior of inflammation-associated cancers remains to be elucidated. Nonconventional types of dysplasia have been increasingly recognized, but their natural history is not well defined, and they have not been incorporated into surveillance algorithms. The concept of cumulative inflammatory burden highlights the importance of considering histologic inflammation over time as an important risk factor for CAC. Dysplasia is arguably the most important risk factor for developing CAC, and advances have been made in the endoscopic detection and removal of precancerous lesions, thereby deferring or avoiding surgical resection. Some of the agents used to treat IBD are chemopreventive. It is hoped that by gaining better control of the underlying inflammation with newer medications and better endoscopic detection and management, a more sophisticated appreciation of clinicopathologic risk factors, and growing awareness of the genetic, immunologic, and environmental causes of colitis- associated neoplasia, that colitis-associated colorectal neoplasia will become even more predictable and manageable in the coming years.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19596953": "Patients with long-standing ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease have an increased risk of developing colorectal cancer and patients with small intestinal Crohn's disease are at increased risk of small bowel adenocarcinoma. Colorectal cancer appearing on the ground of inflammatory bowel disease is the result of a process which is believed to begin from no dysplasia progressing to indefinite dysplasia, low-grade dysplasia, high-grade dysplasia and finally to invasive adenocarcinoma, although colorectal cancer can arise without proceeding through each of these steps. Ulcerative colitis patients with total proctocolectomy and ileal pouch anal-anastomosis have a rather low risk of dysplasia in the ileal pouch, although the anal transition zone should be monitored periodically, especially if chronic pouchitis is present with associated severe villous atrophy. Concerning the risk factors predisposing to colorectal cancer in the setting of ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease, it seems that the risk increases with longer duration and greater anatomic extent of colitis, the degree of inflammation, and the presence of primary sclerosing cholangitis and family history of colorectal cancer. Concerning the mechanisms of carcinogenesis, it is now well established that the molecular alterations responsible for sporadic colorectal cancer, namely chromosomal instability, microsatellite instability and hypermethylation, also play a role in colitis-associated colon carcinogenesis.

Epidemiologic studies continue to highlight the increased risk of CRC in IBD. However, the incidence has declined over the past 30 years, attributed to both successful CRC-surveillance programs and improved control of mucosal inflammation. Risk factors that further increase the risk of IBD-related CRC include disease duration, extent and severity, the presence of inflammatory pseudopolyps, coexistent primary sclerosing cholangitis, and a family history of CRC. All major professional societies agree that IBD-CRC surveillance should occur more frequently than in the general population. Yet, guidelines and consensus statements differ on the surveillance schedule and preferred method of surveillance. Improved sensitivity to previously \"invisible\" flat dysplastic lesions using high definition and chromoendoscopy methods has resulted in many guidelines abandoning requirements for random untargeted biopsies of the colon. While colonic dysplasia remains a worrisome finding, and several clinical scenarios remain best addressed by total proctocolectomy due to concerns of synchronous undetected lesions and the unpredictable tempo of progression to malignancy, better detection techniques have also increased opportunities for endoscopic resection of dysplastic lesions that can be clearly delineated.

Although the exact cause of CRC is still elusive, recent studies have indicated microbial involvement in its etiology.

The evidence that support the role of E. coli in the etiology of CRC, through IBD, is not limited only to chronic inflammation. The growth of E. coli as an intracellular pathogen during IBD and CRC enable the bacteria to modulate the host cell cycle, induce DNA damage and accumulate mutations. These are some of the contributing factors behind the etiology of CRC. The present article considers the current status of the involvement of E. coli, through IBD, in the etiology of CRC.

The standard preoperative prophylactic antibiotic for primary joint arthroplasty was cefuroxime and recommended second-line agent was clindamycin.

In the TKA/UKA group, culture positive PJI was identified in 21 of 2,455 (0.9%) cefuroxime-administered cases and in 3 of 211 (1.4%) noncefuroxime administered cases. The most commonly isolated bacteria in both groups were coagulase negative staphylococci (CNS).

The single fan systems with a standard surgical gown exhausted air laterally from the posterior gown fold at approximately the level of the surgical field. The single fan system with a dedicated zippered suit exhausted air at a level below the surgical field. The dual fan system exhausted air out of the top of the helmet at a level above the surgical field.\nCONCLUSIONS: Space suit systems currently in use in joint replacement surgery differ significantly from traditional body exhaust systems; rather than removing contaminated air from the operating environment, modern systems exhaust this air into the operating room, in some cases potentially towards the sterile instrument tray and the surgical field.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19756495": "Periprosthetic infection is a foreign-body-associated infection that is characterised by delayed osteomyelitis of bone tissue surrounding artificial joint replacement.

The findings confirm that social determinants contribute directly and indirectly (through lifestyle) to life expectancy.

Understanding the roles that social determinants of health (SDOH) play in diabetes management programs, both at the individual and community level, may inform future intervention strategies. Methods: This study performed a secondary data analysis on 1,568 individuals who participated in Salud y Vida (SyV), a local diabetes and chronic disease management program, between October 2013 and September 2018 recruited from a local clinic. The primary outcome was the reduction of hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) at the last follow-up visit compared to the baseline. In addition to age, gender, insurance status, education level and marital status, we also investigated 15 community (census tract) SDOH using the American Community Survey. Because of the high correlation in the community SDOH, we developed the community-level indices representing different domains. Using Bayesian multilevel spatial models that account for the geographic dependency, we were able to simultaneously investigate the individual- and community-level SDOH that may impact HbA1C reduction. Results: After accounting for the diabetes self-management education classes taken by the participants and their length of stay in the program, we found that older age at baseline, being married (compared to being widowed or divorced) and English speaking (compared to Spanish) were significantly associated with greater HbA1C reduction. Moreover, we found that the community level SDOH were also highly associated with HbA1C reduction. With every percentile rank decrease in the socioeconomic advantage index, we estimated an additional 0.018% reduction in HbA1C [95% CI (-0.028, -0.007)]. Besides the socioeconomic advantage index, urban core opportunity and immigrant's cohesion and accessibility indices were also statistically associated with HbA1C reduction. Conclusion: To our knowledge, our study is the first to utilize Bayesian multilevel spatial models and simultaneously investigate both individual- and community-level SDOH in the context of diabetes management.

All cause 28-day mortality among children receiving and not receiving corticosteroids was 15.1% and 18.8%, respectively, p = .30. There was no difference in mean vasoactive-inotropic infusion days between the corticosteroid and no corticosteroid groups, 4.5 days vs. 4.3 days, respectively, p = .59. Similarly there was no difference in mean ventilator days between the corticosteroid and no corticosteroid groups, 8.3 days vs. 7.7 days, respectively, p = .38.\nCONCLUSIONS: Children with severe sepsis who received adjunctive corticosteroid therapy exhibited similar illness severity compared with those who did not.

Therapeutic corticosteroid indications that initially seemed rational have frequently been refuted on closer, rigorous clinical trial inspection. Although it may be prudent to provide stress-dose steroids to children with septic shock who are clinically at risk for adrenal insufficiency (chronic or recent steroid use, purpura fulminans, etomidate or ketoconazole administration, hypothalamic, pituitary, adrenal disease), the safety and efficacy of stress-dose steroids as general adjunctive therapy for pediatric septic shock have not been established. Glucocorticoid administration does add potential risk to critically ill children. In particular, although adjunctive corticosteroids may hasten resolution of unstable hemodynamics in septic shock, this may occur at the metabolic cost of hyperglycemia. Clinical practice that fosters innovative therapy (off-label use) over research probably represents bad medical and social policy. Accordingly, pediatric critical care researchers have a responsibility to generate pediatric-specific evidence-based medicine for adjunctive corticosteroid therapy for severe sepsis in children.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36741650": "Introduction Septic shock remains a leading cause of mortality in pediatric patients. Corticosteroids have been used in the management of sepsis and septic shock, but there is conflicting evidence on the potential benefit of corticosteroid therapy. This study assessed the risk of mortality and length of stay in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) among pediatric patients admitted with a septic shock diagnosis. Method A retrospective cohort study was conducted among pediatric patients (up to 14 years old) admitted with a septic shock diagnosis to the PICU of King Abdullah Specialist Children's Hospital in Riyadh\u00a0from January 2016 to December 2021. The clinical outcomes of patients receiving corticosteroid therapy were compared to those of control patients who were not given corticosteroids. Electronic medical records provided clinical data, severity scores, and the management given for each patient. The patients were followed up from the date of sepsis diagnosis to hospital discharge. Proportional hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated to compare the risk of mortality, length of PICU stay, and length of hospital stay. Results A total of 182 pediatric patients were included in the study, and 86 (47%) received corticosteroid therapy. The median age of the study population was 15 months (interquartile range [IQR]: 2-72 months). Compared to the controls, the patients who received corticosteroids had a higher total Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (mean\u00b1SD: 5.5\u00b13\u00a0vs. 7.1\u00b13.3, respectively; p\u00a0<0.01) and required more ventilation support (72% vs. 28%, respectively) and the use of inotropes and vasopressors (74% vs. 34% and 32% vs. 6%, respectively). In-hospital mortality did not significantly differ between the groups (adjusted HR: 2.66; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.66-10.28). Those patients who received corticosteroids had 42% less risk of staying in the PICU for over six days than those not receiving steroids (HR: 0.35; 95% CI: 0.13-0.98) Conclusion After adjusting for baseline characteristics, severity scores, and medical intervention, no association was found between receiving corticosteroids and mortality (p=0.492).

Due to the constant contact between humans and other animals, many infectious diseases are disseminated. This may happen via direct contact, such as bites or scratches, or by indirect contact, such as when eating bush meat or using contaminated animal parts. Monkeypox disease is one such zoonotic infection which is now emerging as a disease of global concern, and the World Health Organization has already labelled it a public health emergency. The virus is related to other orthopox viruses and may be further classified into two genetically separate clades, the West African and the Central African. The latter is far more pathogenic than the former. Utilizing virotransducer and virostealth proteins, the virus is able to control the host's T-cell-mediated responses and impede the release of cytokines and chemokines.Monkeypox may be treated with tecovirimat, cidofovir, or brincidofovir, and prevention with the vaccination JYNNEOS is recommended. The disease's fast global expansion warrants concern despite the fact that it is less fatal than that caused by the variola virus. Before the sickness reaches catastrophic proportions, we must draw on our prior experiences and act prudently. This article serves as an introduction to the monkeypox virus and its associated pathology, treatments, diagnostics, and preventative measures.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36752829": "Beginning in May 2022, monkeypox infection and vaccination rates dramatically increased due to a worldwide outbreak.

MR neurography of the patient's left suprascapular nerve demonstrated intrinsic hourglass-like constrictions, a characteristic finding of peripheral nerves involved in PTS. Other viral infections and vaccinations are well-documented triggers of PTS, an underrecognized peripheral neuropathy that is thought to be immune-mediated and results in severe upper extremity pain and weakness. The close temporal relationship between monkeypox infection and vaccination, and PTS onset, in this case, suggests a causal relationship and marks the first known report of peripheral neuropathy associated with monkeypox.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36720271": "The recent global outbreak of the monkeypox (mpox) virus in humans was declared a public health emergency by the World Health Organization in July 2022. The smallpox and mpox vaccine (JYNNEOS; Modified Vaccinia Ankara-Bavarian Nordic; MVA-BN), provided as a two-dose regimen, is currently the primary vaccine utilized against mpox. However, the efficacy of MVA-BN against mpox has never been demonstrated in clinical trials to date. Due to the limited supply of vaccines, the World Health Organization has recommended prioritizing the vaccination of high-risk groups. We evaluated the real-world effectiveness of a single, subcutaneous dose of MVA-BN in this observational, retrospective cohort study, which included the analysis of electronic health records of all members of Clalit Health Services eligible for the vaccine on 31 July 2022. We used a Cox proportional hazards regression model with time-dependent covariates to estimate the association between vaccination and mpox while adjusting for sociodemographic and clinical risk factors.

Monkeypox ophthalmic manifestations may present to the ophthalmologist, or the ophthalmologist may be involved in comanagement. This narrative review creates a primer for the ophthalmologist of clinically relevant information regarding monkeypox, its ophthalmic manifestations, and the 2022 outbreak.\nOBSERVATIONS: Monkeypox virus is an Orthopoxvirus (genus includes variola [smallpox] and vaccinia [smallpox vaccine]). The 2022 outbreak is of clade II (historically named West African clade), specifically subclade IIb. In addition to historic transmission patterns (skin lesions, bodily fluids, respiratory droplets), sexual transmission has also been theorized in the current outbreak due to disproportionate occurrence in men who have sex with men. Monkeypox causes a characteristic skin eruption and mucosal lesions and may cause ophthalmic disease. Monkeypox-related ophthalmic disease (MPXROD) includes a spectrum of ocular pathologies including eyelid/periorbital skin lesions, blepharoconjunctivitis, and keratitis). Smallpox vaccination may reduce MPXROD occurrence. MPXROD seems to be rarer in the 2022 outbreaks than in historical outbreaks. MPXROD may result in corneal scarring and blindness. Historical management strategies for MPXROD include lubrication and prevention/management of bacterial superinfection in monkeypox keratitis. Case reports and in vitro data for trifluridine suggest a possible role in MPXROD. Tecovirimat, cidofovoir, brincidofovir and vaccinia immune globulin intravenous may be used for systemic infection. There is a theoretical risk for monkeypox transmission by corneal transplantation, and the Eye Bank Association of America has provided guidance. Smallpox vaccines (JYNNEOS [Bavarian Nordic] and ACAM2000 [Emergent Product Development Gaithersburg Inc]) provide immunity against monkeypox.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The ophthalmologist may play an important role in the diagnosis and management of monkeypox.

The California Department of Public Health investigated whether demographic disparities in vaccination series completion varied by route of administration of the recipient's first dose. Among California residents who received their first dose during August 9, 2022-March 31, 2023, a total of 59.8% received a second dose.

Herein, we conducted a retrospective cohort study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a three-drug combination of 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 receptor antagonists (5HT3RA), dexamethasone (DEX), and neurokinin 1 receptor antagonists (NK1RA) for the prevention of CINV during mFFX therapy.\nMETHODS: This study enrolled patients with APC who received mFFX as initial therapy with a combination of 5HT3RA, DEX, and NK1RA as antiemetic prophylaxis. The primary endpoint was the complete response (CR) rate during cycle 1, which was defined as no emetic episodes and no rescue medication use during the overall period (0-120\u00a0h). Safety was also evaluated with a focus on hyperglycemia, which is a concern in patients with APC.\nRESULTS: Seventy patients were eligible for this retrospective analysis. The CR rate during the overall period was 51.4%. Significant nausea, defined as grade 2 or higher, peaked to 77.1% on days 4-5, but remained above 65% until day 7. Hyperglycemia occurred in 37.1% of patients, and 34.3% were grade 3 hyperglycemia.\nCONCLUSIONS: CINV induced by mFFX was poorly controlled even with prophylactic antiemetic therapy using 5HT3RA, DEX, and NK1RA, and was found to persist beyond 5\u00a0days. Enhanced antiemetic measures for mFFX are desirable.

Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) are amongst the most troublesome side effects that impair patients' adherence to treatments and their quality of life (QoL). NEPA (Akynzeo\u00ae), is an oral fixed-dose combination of netupitant [a neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist (NK1RA), 300 mg] and palonosetron [(5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin or 5HT) type3 receptor antagonist (5HT3RA), 0.5 mg] which has been shown to be effective in preventing CINV.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: This prospective study started before the outbreak of COVID-19 and was carried out during the pandemic period. The aim was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a single oral dose NEPA plus 12 mg of dexamethasone (DEX) in patients treated with Folfoxiri plus Bevacizumab and Folfirinox. The patients were diagnosed with advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) or advanced pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). They were divided into two groups: na\u00efve patients and patients previously treated with serotonin receptor antagonists (5HT3-RA) and neurokin-1 receptor antagonists (NK1-RA).\nRESULTS: During the overall phase, the complete response (CR) rate was 96.8% in na\u00efve patients treated with Folfoxiri plus Bevacizumab, and 94.6% in patients treated with Folfirinox.\u00a0During the acute and delayed phases, the CR rate was 92.8% and 94.2%, with Folfoxiri and Bevacizumab, as well as 96.2% and 94.6%, with Folfirinox.\u00a0There was no adequate control of CINV events in patients on antiemetic prophylaxis with 5HT3-RA or NK1-RA associated with cortisone.

All participants received a 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 receptor antagonist and dexamethasone.\nRESULTS: Of the 400 patients enrolled from May 2013 to January 2015, 386 were eligible for evaluation. The median age was 64 (range, 26-84). The overall complete response (CR; no emetic events and no antiemetic measures) rate was 64%. The proportion of patients showing CR was low in the carboplatin (CBDCA)- and oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy groups, especially among women. We showed that the CR rates in men were high in the CBDCA (AUC5)\u2009+\u2009etoposide (ETP) (80%), capecitabine plus oxaliplatin (CAPOX) (78%), and CBDCA+ paclitaxel (PTX) groups for lung cancer (73%).

However, two antiemetics may be sufficiently effective for elderly male patients receiving CBDCA (AUC5)\u2009+\u2009ETP, CBDCA+PTX for lung cancer, or CAPOX. Additionally, we consider that three antiemetics are necessary for women with colorectal cancer receiving CAPOX. Risk factor analysis related to CR showed that CINV prophylaxis in patients treated with CBDCA-based chemotherapy was generally supportive of the guideline-recommended three antiemetics.

The CINV risk assessment tool was used to collect the study data and to assess CINV risk score. Results \u2003Ninety-eight patients fulfilling the eligibility criteria were included in this study, out of which 57% were males, median age was 48 years (range: 28-77). Colorectal cancer (32.7%) was the most common diagnosis followed by gastric cancer (27.6%). Gemcitabine/cisplatin and CAPOX regimen were the most common regimen being administered in 19.4% each. As per MASCC guidelines, 19.4% patients received highly emetogenic chemotherapy, 69.4% moderately emetogenic chemotherapy, while 11.2% received regimen with low emetogenicity. CINV risk module characterized 52% patients to have high risk for CINV, while 48% to have low risk of CINV, thus, 52% had the discrepancy in risk assigned by two methods, and this was statistically significant ( p = 0.025).

After matching, primary NK1-RA use was not associated with higher rates of protection from emesis regardless the emesis phase (acute phase, p = 0.34; delayed phase, p = 0.14; overall phase, p = 0.80). On the other hand, a lower rate of relevant nausea (p = 0.02) and need for rescue antiemetic therapy (p = 0.000007) in the overall phase was found in primary NK1-RA users. Furthermore, a higher rate of both complete antiemetic response (p = 0.00001) and complete antiemetic protection (p = 0.00007) in the overall phase was more frequently observed in primary NK1-RA users.

To evaluate this hypothesis, we compared symptoms reported by the affected individuals in Havana, Cuba, to symptoms reported by corresponding patients from a tertiary academic neurotology clinic with a chief complaint of vertigo or disequilibrium, who met the International Classification of Headache Disorders criteria for VM. The prevalence of the Havana subjects experiencing various symptomatic domains was compared with the VM cohort, leading to 26 unique domains and statistical comparisons between the cohorts. Of the 26 domains compared between the two cohorts, 18 were not significantly different. This included the two most important components of meeting criteria for VM, namely the co-existence of headache and vestibular symptoms. On regression analysis, the only feature which kept its significant difference between the two cohorts was acute intense head pressure (P\u00a0=\u00a00.007). The domains with similar occurrence ratios included dizziness, headache, light sensitivity, hearing reduction, and tinnitus. In other words, multiple headache and vestibular symptoms, consistent with VM criteria, were similar between the two cohorts. The considerable similarities across various domains between VM patients and Havana subjects could be due to migraine as a possible common etiology for both groups.

A growing body of evidence has shown the pivotal role of OS in the development of several pathological conditions during the neonatal period, which have been therefore defined as OS-related neonatal diseases. Due to the physiological immaturity of their antioxidant defenses and to the enhanced antenatal and postnatal exposure to free radicals, preterm infants are particularly susceptible to oxidative damage, and several pathophysiological cascades involved in the development of prematurity-related complications are tightly related to OS. This narrative review aims to provide a detailed overview of the OS-related pathophysiological mechanisms that contribute to the main OS-related diseases during pregnancy and in the early postnatal period in the preterm population. Particularly, focus has been placed on pregnancy disorders typically associated with iatrogenic or spontaneous preterm birth, such as intrauterine growth restriction, pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, chorioamnionitis, and on specific postnatal complications for which the role of OS has been largely ascertained (e.g., respiratory distress, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, retinopathy of prematurity, periventricular leukomalacia, necrotizing enterocolitis, neonatal sepsis).

Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio within 24 hours from the time they were last known to be well to undergo endovascular therapy and receive medical management or to receive medical management alone. The primary outcome was the score on the modified Rankin scale at 90 days (scores range from 0 to 6, with higher scores indicating greater disability), and the primary objective was to determine whether a shift in the distribution of the scores on the modified Rankin scale at 90 days had occurred between the two groups. Secondary outcomes included scores of 0 to 2 and 0 to 3 on the modified Rankin scale. The primary safety outcome was symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage within 48 hours after randomization.\nRESULTS: A total of 456 patients were enrolled; 231 were assigned to the endovascular-therapy group and 225 to the medical-management group. Approximately 28% of the patients in both groups received intravenous thrombolysis. The trial was stopped early owing to the efficacy of endovascular therapy after the second interim analysis. At 90 days, a shift in the distribution of scores on the modified Rankin scale toward better outcomes was observed in favor of endovascular therapy over medical management alone (generalized odds ratio, 1.37; 95% confidence interval, 1.11 to 1.69; P\u2009=\u20090.004).

Studies of left-side colon cancer (LCC) and right-side colon cancer (RCC) show that these two subtypes have different prognoses, outcomes, and clinical responses to chemotherapy. Therefore, a better understanding of the importance of the clinical classifications of the anatomic subtypes of colon cancer is needed.\nMETHODS: We collected colon cancer patients' transcriptome data, clinical information, and somatic mutation data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database portal. The transcriptome data were taken from 390 colon cancer patients (172 LCC samples and 218 RCC samples); the somatic mutation data included 142 LCC samples and 187 RCC samples. We compared the expression and prognostic differences of LCC and RCC by conducting a multi-omics analysis of each using the clinical characteristics, immune microenvironment, transcriptomic differences, and mutation differences. The prognostic signatures was validated using the internal testing set, complete set, and external testing set (GSE39582). We also verified the independent prognostic value of the signature.\nRESULTS: The results of our clinical characteristic analysis showed that RCC had a significantly worse prognosis than LCC. The analysis of the immune microenvironment showed that immune infiltration was more common in RCC than LCC. The results of differential gene analysis showed that there were 360 differentially expressed genes, with 142 upregulated genes in LCC and 218 upregulated genes in RCC. The mutation frequency of RCC was generally higher than that of LCC. BRAF and KRAS gene mutations were the dominant genes mutations in RCC, and they had a strong mutual exclusion with APC, while APC gene mutation was the dominant gene mutation in LCC. This suggests that the molecular mechanisms of RCC and LCC differed. The 4-mRNA and 6-mRNA in the prognostic signatures of LCC and RCC, respectively, were highly predictive and may be used as independent prognostic factors.\nCONCLUSION: The clinical classification of the anatomic subtypes of colon cancer is of great significance for early diagnosis and prognostic risk assessment.

However, colorectal cancer is not a single type of tumor; its pathogenesis depends on the anatomical location of the tumor and differs between right side and left side of the colon. Tumors in the proximal colon (right side) and distal colon (left side) exhibit different molecular characteristics and histology. In the right-sided tumors, mutations in the DNA mismatch repair pathway are commonly observed; and these tumors generally have a flat histology. In the left-sided tumors, chromosomal instability pathway-related mutations, such as KRAS, APC, PIK3CA, p53 mutations are observed and these tumors demonstrate polypoid-like morphology. Therapy responses are totally different between these tumor entities. Left-sided colorectal cancer (LCRC) patients benefit more from adjuvant chemotherapies such as 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-based regimes, and targeted therapies such as anti- epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) therapy, and have a better prognosis. Right-sided colorectal cancer (RCRC) patients do not respond well to conventional chemotherapies, but demonstrate more promising results with immunotherapies because these tumors have high antigenic load. For the development of effective therapy regimes and better treatment options, it is essential to evaluate right-sided and left-sided tumors as separate entities, and design the therapy regime considering the differences between these tumors.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29796712": "Colorectal cancer does not represent a single anatomic entity and side of origin has a key impact on prognosis and response to different systemic therapies. Compared to tumours arising in left colon, right colorectal cancers rely on the activation of different molecular pathways (e.g. BRAF mutation and MSI status). From a clinical point of view, this results in a different response to anti-EGFR agents. Current guidelines suggest the use of cetuximab or panitumumab in RAS wild-type disease and left colon cancer especially for cytoreduction/conversion purposes, since the expected benefit in right colon cancer is absent or clinically modest. The prognostic role of microbiota in colorectal cancer disease deserves more clarification before being considered in common clinical practice. Screening policies could also be affected by these new acquisitions. At the moment, sidedness should be considered as a strong prognostic variable and a surrogate predictor of different activity of anti-EGFR agents in the metastatic setting.

In this translational study, we aimed to assess the mutation frequencies of the EGFR (hotspot area and polyadenine deletions A13_del), KRAS, BRAF(V600E), and PIK3CA oncogenes in a series of 280 CRC patients. MSI phenotypes are also considered in this series. All patients' clinicopathological data were assessed for statistical analysis and its associations were validated. We verified multiple associations between oncogenic mutations and determined clinicopathological tumor features (1) EGFR A13_deletions are associated with right colon carcinoma (P<0.005), mucinous histotype (P=0.042), G3 grading (P=0.024), and MSI status (P<0.005); (2) PIK3CA mutations are related mucinous histotype (P=0.021); (3) KRAS(G12) and KRAS(G13) mutations are correlated, respectively, with the left and right colon cancer development (P<0.005), and finally (4) MSI is associated with right colon tumors (P<0.005). Mostly, we verified a higher frequency rate of the KRAS(G13) and EGFR A13_del oncogene mutations in right colon cancer; whereas KRAS(G12) codon mutation occurs more frequently in left colon cancers.

However, heterogeneity has been proposed to exist between high and middle/low rectal cancers. We aimed to examine the efficacy of anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) treatment for middle/low rectal and left-sided colon cancers.\nMETHODS: This study enrolled 609 patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who were treated with anti-EGFR therapy. They were divided into groups based on primary tumour locations: the right-sided colon, the left-sided colon or the middle/low rectum. The efficacy of first-line and non-first-line anti-EGFR treatment was analysed. Genomic differences in colorectal cancer data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) were investigated and visualised with OncoPrint and a clustered heatmap.\nRESULTS: On first-line anti-EGFR treatment, patients with middle/low rectal tumours had significantly lower progression-free survival, overall survival, and overall response rates (6.8 months, 27.8 months and 43%, respectively) than those with left-sided colon cancer (10.1 months, 38.3 months and 66%, respectively).

Gap junctions are formed from connexin proteins and are responsible for transfer of biologically active molecules, metabolites, and salts between neighboring cells or cells and their extracellular environment. Over the last few years, aberrant connexin 43 (Cx43) expression has been associated with cancer recurrence, metastatic spread, and poor survival. Here we provide an overview of the general structure and function of gap junctions and review their roles in different cancer types. We discuss new therapeutic approaches targeting Cx43 and potential new ways of exploiting gap junction transfer for drug delivery and anti-cancer treatment. The permeability of Cx43 channels to small molecules and macromolecules makes them highly attractive targets for delivering drugs directly into the cytoplasm. Cancer cells overexpressing Cx43 may be more permeable and sensitive to chemotherapeutics. Because Cx43 can either act as a tumor suppressor or oncogene, biomarker analysis and a better understanding of how Cx43 contextually mediates cancer phenotypes will be required to develop clinically viable Cx43-based therapies.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29861876": "According to the World Health Organization (WHO), cancer is one of main causes of death worldwide, with 8.2 million people dying from this disease in 2012. Because of this, new forms of treatments or improvement of current treatments are crucial. In this regard, Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been used to successfully treat cancers that can be easily accessed externally or by fibre-optic endoscopes, such as skin, bladder and esophagus cancers. In addition, this therapy can used alongside radiotherapy and chemotherapy in order to kill cancer cells. The main problem in implementing PDT is penetration of visible light deeper than 10 mm in tissues, due to scattering and absorption by tissue chromophores. Unfortunately, this excludes several internal organs affected by cancer. Another issue in this regard is the use of a selective cancer cell-photosensitizing compound. Nevertheless, several groups have recently developed scintillation nanoparticles, which can be stimulated by X-rays, thereby making this a possible solution for light production in deeper tissues. Alternative approaches have also been developed, such as photosensitizer structure modifications and cell membrane permeabilizing agents. In this context, certain channels lead to transitory plasma membrane permeability changes, such as pannexin, connexin hemmichannels, TRPV1-4 and P2\u00d77, which allow for the non-selective passage of molecules up to 1,000 Da. Herein, we discuss the particular case of the P2\u00d77 receptor-associated pore as a drug delivery system for hydrophilic substances to be applied in PDT, which could also be carried out with other channels.

Gap junction channels, composed of connexin proteins, provide a mechanism for direct transfer of small molecules across membranes, and recent evidence suggests that the transfer of larger, polymer-like molecules such as microRNAs may be possible. Here, we report direct evidence of gap junction-mediated transfer of polymeric macromolecules. Specifically, we examined the transport of dextran chains with molecular weights ranging from 10 to 70 kDa. We found that dextran chains of up to 40 kDa can diffuse through at least five cell layers in a gap junction-dependent manner within a 30 min time frame. Further, we evaluated the ability of connectosomes, cell-derived vesicles containing functional connexin proteins, to be loaded with dextran chains. By opening connexon hemichannel pores within the membranes of connectosomes, we found that 10 kDa dextran was loaded into more than 90% of vesicles, with reduced levels of loading for dextran chains of larger molecular weight. Upon delivering 10 kDa dextran-loaded connectosomes to cells, we further found that connectosomes transferred these membrane-impermeable molecules to the cellular cytosol with dramatically improved efficiency in comparison to the delivery of free, unencapsulated dextran. Collectively, these results reveal that polymeric macromolecules can be delivered to cells via gap junctions, suggesting that the gap junction route may be useful for the delivery of polymeric therapeutic molecules, such as nucleic acids and peptides.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10835092": "OBJECTIVE: To determine the role of Mycobacterium bovis in active pediatric tuberculosis (TB) in a United States-Mexico border region.\nMETHOD: We reviewed all new cases of pediatric (<15 years old) TB presenting to San Diego hospitals and clinics from 1980 to 1997. Patients were categorized by age, ethnicity, country of origin, culture results, and disease manifestations. Case definitions were similar to those used by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Mycobacterium bovis, the cause of bovine-type tuberculosis, has an exceptionally wide host range. Susceptible species include cattle, humans, non-human primates, goats, cats dogs, pigs, buffalo, badgers, possums, deer and bison. Many susceptible species, including man, are spillover hosts in which infection is not self-maintaining. In countries where there is transmission of infection from endemically infected wildlife populations to cattle or other farmed animals, eradication is not feasible and control measures must be applied indefinitely. Possible methods of limiting spread of infection from wildlife to cattle including the use of vaccines are outlined. The usefulness of DNA fingerprinting of M. bovis strains as an epidemiological tool and of BCG vaccination of humans and cattle as a control measure are reviewed. The factors determining susceptibility to infection and clinical disease, and the infectiousness of infected hosts and transmission of infection, are detailed. Reports of the epidemiology of M. bovis infections in man and a variety of animal species are reviewed. M. bovis infection was recognised as a major public health problem when this organism was transmitted to man via milk from infected cows. The introduction of pasteurization helped eliminate this problem. Those occupational groups working with M. bovis infected cattle or deer, on the farm or in the slaughter house, are more likely to develop pulmonary disease than alimentary disease. In recent years, tuberculosis in farmed cervidae has become a disease of economic as well as public health importance in several countries.

Patients with confirmed narcolepsy type 1 according to clinical criteria were randomly assigned to receive twice-daily oral TAK-994 (30 mg, 90 mg, or 180 mg) or placebo. The primary end point was the mean change from baseline to week 8 in average sleep latency (the time it takes to fall asleep) on the Maintenance of Wakefulness Test (range, 0 to 40 minutes; normal ability to stay awake, \u226520 minutes). Secondary end points included the change in the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) score (range, 0 to 24, with higher scores indicating greater daytime sleepiness; normal, <10) and the weekly cataplexy rate.\nRESULTS: Of the 73 patients, 17 received TAK-994 at a dose of 30 mg twice daily, 20 received 90 mg twice daily, 19 received 180 mg twice daily, and 17 received placebo. The phase 2 trial and an extension trial were terminated early owing to hepatic adverse events. Primary end-point data were available for 41 patients (56%); the main reason for missing data was early trial termination. Least-squares mean changes to week 8 in average sleep latency on the MWT were 23.9 minutes in the 30-mg group, 27.4 minutes in the 90-mg group, 32.6 minutes in the 180-mg group, and -2.5 minutes in the placebo group (difference vs. placebo, 26.4 minutes in the 30-mg group, 29.9 minutes in the 90-mg group, and 35.0 minutes the 180-mg group; P<0.001 for all comparisons). Least-squares mean changes to week 8 in the ESS score were -12.2 in the 30-mg group, -13.5 in the 90-mg group, -15.1 in the 180-mg group, and -2.1 in the placebo group (difference vs. placebo, -10.1 in the 30-mg group, -11.4 in the 90-mg group, and -13.0 in the 180-mg group).

Orexin 2 receptor (OX2R) knockout (KO) mice, but not orexin 1 receptor (OX1R) KO mice, show narcolepsy-like phenotypes, thus OX2R agonists are potentially promising for treating NT1. In fact, in early proof-of-concept studies, intravenous infusion of danavorexton, an OX2R-selective agonist, significantly increased wakefulness in individuals with NT1. However, danavorexton has limited oral availability. Here, we report pharmacological characteristics of a novel OX2R agonist, TAK-994 [N-{(2S,3S)-1-(2-hydroxy-2-methylpropanoyl)-2-[(2,3',5'-trifluorobiphenyl-3-yl)methyl]pyrrolidin-3-yl}methanesulfonamide sesquihydrate]. TAK-994 activated recombinant human OX2R (EC<sub>50</sub> value of 19 nM) with &gt; 700-fold selectivity against OX1R and activated OX2R-downstream signaling similar to those by orexin peptides in vitro. Oral administration of TAK-994 promoted wakefulness in normal mice but not in OX2R KO mice. TAK-994 also ameliorated narcolepsy-like symptoms in two mouse models of narcolepsy: orexin/ataxin-3 mice and orexin-tTA;TetO diphtheria toxin A mice. The wake-promoting effects of TAK-994 in orexin/ataxin-3 mice were maintained after chronic dosing for 14 days. These data suggest that overall in vitro and in vivo properties, except oral availability, are very similar between TAK-994 and danavorexton. Preclinical characteristics of TAK-994 shown here, together with upcoming clinical study results, can improve our understanding for orally available OX2R agonists as new therapeutic drugs for NT1 and other hypersomnia disorders. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Narcolepsy type 1 (NT1) is caused by a loss of orexin neurons, and thus an orexin 2 receptor (OX2R) agonist is considered to address the underlying pathophysiology of NT1. Oral administration of TAK-994, a novel OX2R agonist, promoted wakefulness in normal mice, but not in OX2R knockout mice, and ameliorated fragmentation of wakefulness and cataplexy-like episodes in mouse models of narcolepsy.

Data about the efficacy and safety of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are reported in the literature for the treatment of acute SVT, but less is known about their application for the secondary prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism (VTE). The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of long-term DOACs therapy in patients at high-risk of thrombosis, compared to VKA.\nMETHODS: This is a retrospective single-centre study including 70 patients with SVT on long-term anticoagulant treatment with VKA followed-up at our Units between January 2017 and December 2019. All the patients were at high thrombotic risk defined as the presence of a permanent prothrombotic condition requiring long-term anticoagulation. During follow-up, 28 patients were shifted to DOACs and their clinical outcomes were compared to those of the patients who continued VKA therapy. All the arterial and venous thrombotic events of the splanchnic and extra-splanchnic districts as well as the haemorrhagic adverse events occurring during follow-up were recorded.\nRESULTS: Of the seventy patients enrolled in the study, 36 patients (51.4%) had a single-segment involvement thrombosis (28.5% of portal vein, 7.1% of superior mesenteric vein, 4.3% of splenic vein, 11.5% of hepatic veins) and 34 patients (48.6%) had multi-segment involvement at the time of diagnosis. 42 patients (60%) continued VKA therapy and 28 (40%) were switched to DOACs. Median follow-up was 6\u00a0years (range 2-8) during VKA and 1.9\u00a0years (range 1-5.2) during DOACs. The incidence of thrombotic events was similar between patients on VKA and those on DOACs. Patients on VKA developed deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and of the patients on DOACs 1 developed NSTEMI and 1 DVT. No major haemorrhagic events occurred. Minor bleedings occurred in 26% of patients on VKA and in none of the DOACs patients (P: 0.09).\nCONCLUSIONS: Our results highlight that DOACs could represent an effective and safe alternative to the VKA for secondary prophylaxis in SVT patients at high risk of thrombosis.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26513113": "OBJECTIVE: Splanchnic vein thrombosis (SVT) is a potentially severe complication of pancreatitis.

Recent reports of the prevalence and incidence of gout vary widely according to the population studied and methods employed but range from a prevalence of <1% to 6.8% and an incidence of 0.58-2.89 per 1,000 person-years. Gout is more prevalent in men than in women, with increasing age, and in some ethnic groups. Despite rising prevalence and incidence, suboptimal management of gout continues in many countries. Typically, only a third to half of patients with gout receive urate-lowering\u00a0therapy, which is a definitive, curative treatment, and fewer than a half of patients adhere to treatment. Many gout risk factors exist, including obesity, dietary factors and comorbid conditions.

Overall, the dietary factors appear to have a small effect on serum urate levels, and their impact on the long-term clinical course of gout is uncertain. Limited evidence suggests that avoidance of certain foods and beverages may decrease the frequency of gout flares. Weight loss may be beneficial for prevention as well as treatment of gout.

There were no reports of severe hypoglycaemia and no deaths during the study.\nINTERPRETATION: In people with type 2 diabetes, retatrutide showed clinically meaningful improvements in glycaemic control and robust reductions in bodyweight, with a safety profile consistent with GLP-1 receptor agonists and GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonists. These phase 2 data also informed dose selection for the phase 3 programme.\nFUNDING: Eli Lilly and Company.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37947489": "INTRODUCTION: Obesity is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, osteoarthritis, and some cancers. Retatrutide stimulates Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptors, and glucagon receptors, and is being developed for the treatment of obesity and type 2 diabetes.\nAREAS COVERED: A phase 2 clinical trial of retatrutide (LY3437943) in the treatment of obesity. The primary end point was percentage change in weight from baseline to 24\u2009weeks, which ranged from -7.2% to -~18% as the dose of retatrutide increased from 1\u2009mg to 12\u2009mg. The most frequent adverse events were gastrointestinal (nausea, diarrhea, vomiting).\nEXPERT OPINION: The results for retatrutide in phase 2 for obesity (and diabetes) are mostly encouraging. Consistent with being a GLP-1 receptor agonist, heart rate was increased by up to 6.7 beats/min by retatrutide, which may be detrimental and offset some of the benefits of weight loss. Presumably, retatrutide is being developed as a challenger to the recently developed weight loss medicines; semaglutide and/or tirzepatide. Thus, comparator studies are needed between retatrutide and these drugs, but none are ongoing and, in my opinion, this lack is a major omission in the development of retatrutide.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24264989": "The gut microbiota influences both local and systemic inflammation. Inflammation contributes to development, progression, and treatment of cancer, but it remains unclear whether commensal bacteria affect inflammation in the sterile tumor microenvironment. Here, we show that disruption of the microbiota impairs the response of subcutaneous tumors to CpG-oligonucleotide immunotherapy and platinum chemotherapy. In antibiotics-treated or germ-free mice, tumor-infiltrating myeloid-derived cells responded poorly to therapy, resulting in lower cytokine production and tumor necrosis after CpG-oligonucleotide treatment and deficient production of reactive oxygen species and cytotoxicity after chemotherapy. Thus, optimal responses to cancer therapy require an intact commensal microbiota that mediates its effects by modulating myeloid-derived cell functions in the tumor microenvironment. These findings underscore the importance of the microbiota in the outcome of disease treatment.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28270698": "Evidence is growing that the gut microbiota modulates the host response to chemotherapeutic drugs, with three main clinical outcomes: facilitation of drug efficacy; abrogation and compromise of anticancer effects; and mediation of toxicity. The implication is that gut microbiota are critical to the development of personalized cancer treatment strategies and, therefore, a greater insight into prokaryotic co-metabolism of chemotherapeutic drugs is now required. This thinking is based on evidence from human, animal and in vitro studies that gut bacteria are intimately linked to the pharmacological effects of chemotherapies (5-fluorouracil, cyclophosphamide, irinotecan, oxaliplatin, gemcitabine, methotrexate) and novel targeted immunotherapies such as anti-PD-L1 and anti-CLTA-4 therapies. The gut microbiota modulate these agents through key mechanisms, structured as the 'TIMER' mechanistic framework: Translocation, Immunomodulation, Metabolism, Enzymatic degradation, and Reduced diversity and ecological variation. The gut microbiota can now, therefore, be targeted to improve efficacy and reduce the toxicity of current chemotherapy agents. In this Review, we outline the implications of pharmacomicrobiomics in cancer therapeutics and define how the microbiota might be modified in clinical practice to improve efficacy and reduce the toxic burden of these compounds.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36212852": "Chemotherapy is one of the most effective methods of systemic cancer treatment. Chemotherapy drugs are delivered through the blood circulation system, and they can act at all stages of the cell cycle, and can target DNA, topoisomerase, or tubulin to prevent the growth and proliferation of cancer cells. However, due to the lack of specific targets for chemotherapeutic agents, there are still unavoidable complications of cytotoxic effects. The effect of the microbiome on human health is clear. There is growing evidence of the potential relationship between the microbiome and the efficacy of cancer therapy. Gut microbiota can regulate the metabolism of drugs in several ways. The presence of bacteria in the tumor environment can also affect the response to cancer therapy by altering the chemical structure of chemotherapeutic agents and affecting their activity and local concentration. However, the underlying mechanisms by which the gut and tumor microbiota affect cancer therapeutic response are unclear.

In addition to their role in therapy efficacy, gut microbiota could also impact side effects induced by anticancer treatments. In the first part of this review, we summarized the role of the gut microbiome on the efficacy and side effects of various anticancer treatments and underlying mechanisms.

The disease, which commonly affects older men but can also present in children, is associated with a distinct immunophenotype including universal expression of CD123, the \u03b1 chain of the interleukin 3 receptor. Recently, tagraxofusp, a CD123-targeting drug consisting of the ligand for CD123, interleukin 3, conjugated to a truncated diphtheria toxin payload was approved for treatment of BPDCN. This was the first agent specifically approved for BPDCN and the first CD123 targeted agent in oncology. Here, we review the development of tagraxofusp, and the key preclinical insights and clinical data that led to approval. Tagraxofusp treatment is associated with a unique toxicity, capillary leak syndrome (CLS), which can be severe but is manageable with proper patient selection and monitoring, early recognition, and directed intervention. We outline our approach to the use of tagraxofusp and discuss open questions in the treatment of BPDCN.

Tagraxofusp's most significant success has come from studies involving patients with blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN), an aggressive disease that is usually refractory to conventional chemotherapy. Tagraxofusp had an acceptable safety profile and high efficacy in early phase I/II studies on patients with BPDCN. Another phase II study confirmed the good response rates, resulting in Food and Drugs Administration and European Medicine Agency approval of tagraxofusp for the treatment of BPDCN. Considering its high efficacy and its manageable safety profile, tagraxofusp has been suddenly explored in other myeloid malignancies with high expression of cell surface CD123, both in monotherapy or combination strategies. The triplet tagraxofusp-azacytidine-venetoclax appears to be of particular interest among these combinations. Furthermore, combination strategies may be used to overcome tagraxofusp resistance. The downregulation of DPH1 (diphthamide biosynthesis 1), the enzyme responsible for the conversion of histidine 715 on eEF2 to diphthamide, which is then the direct target of ADP ribosylation DT, is typically associated with this resistance phenomenon. It has been discovered that azacitidine can reverse DHP1 expression and restore sensitivity to tagraxofusp. In conclusion, the success of tagraxofusp in BPDCN paved the way for its application even in other CD123-positive malignancies.

We previously found that AMLs with acquired resistance to TAG were re-sensitized by the DNA hypomethylating agent azacitidine (AZA) and that TAG-exposed cells became more dependent on the antiapoptotic molecule BCL-2. Here, we report a phase 1b study in 56 adults with CD123-positive AML or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), first combining TAG with AZA in AML/MDS, and subsequently TAG, AZA, and the BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax (VEN) in AML. Adverse events with 3-day TAG dosing were as expected, without indication of increased toxicity of TAG or AZA+/-VEN in combination. The recommended phase 2 dose of TAG was 12\u00a0\u03bcg/kg/day for 3\u00a0days, with 7-day AZA\u00a0+/- 21-day VEN.

Areas Covered: In this review, we discuss the use of tagraxofusp in BPDCN, and active clinical trials involving this agent in several hematologic malignancies are also presented. Tagraxofusp has significant efficacy in patients with BPDCN and manageable safety profile, with the most commonly reported adverse events being asymptomatic elevation of alanine and aspartate aminotransferase levels, hypoalbuminemia, peripheral edema, and thrombocytopenia. The most serious side effect is capillary leak syndrome that can be lethal in some cases but the risk may be mitigated by early recognition and intervention.

Men generally present with breast cancer at an older age compared with women. Histologically, MBC is often of grade 2, hormone receptor positive, HER2 negative, and no special type carcinoma although in situ and invasive papillary carcinomas are common.

The viral hepatitis co-infection was treated with pegylated interferon (IFN)-alpha and tenofovir in the past (non-response after treatment), followed by maintenance therapy with tenofovir. Since the echinococosis was inactive, there was no need for specific treatment. The therapy for NSCLC had to be stopped after three weeks due to rising liver enzymes. HDV-RNA could be detected as high as 107 GE/mL in the serum, HBV-DNA was not detected. A liver biopsy was performed. Histological analysis showed a chronic and partly active hepatitis, but its aetiology remained unclear. Because of the stable viral load after the first administration of pembrolizumab, an autoimmune-induced liver injury was suspected. Thus, a prednisolone-treatment was initiated. Yet, the liver enzyme levels did not decline, so bulevirtide (2 mg/d s.c.) was added to the ongoing antiviral treatment with tenofovir. This new treatment combination led to a restitution of the elevated enzymes; HDV-RNA was below detection limit. Finally, the therapy for NSCLC could be continued.

Pegylated interferon-\u02512a was used in combination with BLV in two patients.

Only one patient showed significant alanine aminotransferase increases within 24 weeks of follow-up. BLV was reintroduced in three patients after 13-62 BLV-free weeks and was well tolerated, and all patients achieved virologic response again.\nCONCLUSIONS: BLV discontinuation upon long-term HDV-RNA suppression seems safe. Retreatment with BLV was effective in case of virologic relapse. These findings are within a limited number of patients, and future studies are needed to define stopping rules and further investigate the safety of stopping BLV.\nIMPACT AND IMPLICATIONS: Limited data exist on stopping bulevirtide (BLV) treatment in patients who achieve long-term HDV-RNA suppression. In a small cohort of seven Austrian patients discontinuing BLV therapy, HDV-RNA relapses were observed in four patients during long-term follow-up, whereas significant alanine aminotransferase increases were recorded in only one.

While some guidelines recommend universal screening for all people with HBV, others recommend risk-based screening. Estimates of the global HDV prevalence range from 4.5 to 14.6% among persons with HBV; thus, there may be up to 72 million individuals with HDV worldwide.

The poor impact on distant control is a major limitation of this strategy, with metastasis rates remaining in the 25-35% range and recovery after radical surgery leading to reluctance with prescription and inconsistent patient compliance with adjuvant chemotherapy. A second limitation is the low rate of pathologic complete response (pCR) (around 10-15%) despite multiple efforts to potentiate preoperative chemoradiation regimens, which in turn means it is less effective at achieving non-operative management (NOM). Total neoadjuvant treatment (TNT) is a pragmatic approach to solving these problems by introducing systemic chemotherapy at an early timepoint. Enthusiasm for delivering TNT for patients with LARC is increasing in light of the results of published randomized phase III trials, which show a doubling of the pCR rate and a significant reduction in the risk of subsequent metastases. However, there has been no demonstrated improvement in quality of life or overall survival. A plethora of potential chemotherapy schedules are available around the radiotherapy component, which include preoperative induction or consolidation with a range of options (FOLFOXIRI, FOLFOX, or CAPEOX,) and a varying duration of 6-18 weeks, prior to long course chemoradiation (LCCRT) or consolidation NACT following short-course preoperative radiation therapy (SCPRT) using 5 \u00d7 5 Gy or LCCRT using 45-60 Gy, respectively. The need to maintain optimal local control is a further important factor, and preliminary data appear to indicate that the RT schedule remains a crucial issue, especially in more advanced tumors, i.e., mesorectal fascia (MRF) invasion. Thus, there is no consensus as to the optimum combination, sequence, or duration of TNT. The selection of patients most likely to benefit is challenging, as clear-cut criteria to individuate patients benefiting from TNT are lacking.

The median DFS at 2\u00a0years was 22.5\u00a0months with better survival noted for those who underwent surgery or had cCR (with NOM) compared to those who did not undergo surgery (due to progression, inadequate regression, or patient preference despite residual disease) -mDFS 27.7\u00a0months versus 11.4\u00a0months, p\u2009=\u2009\u2009<\u20090.0001 and mOS 29.2\u00a0months versus 15\u00a0months p\u2009=\u2009\u2009<\u20090.0001.\nCONCLUSION: The hybrid TNT regimen was administered without significant dose delays or interruptions. Toxicity was manageable but with two treatment-related deaths.

However, neoadjuvant CRT has no recognised impact on reducing distant recurrence, and patients suffer from a long-lasting impairment in quality of life (QOL) associated with TME. Total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT) is an alternative approach that could reduce distant metastases and increase the proportion of patients who could safely undergo non-operative management (NOM). This study is designed to compare two TNT regimens in the context of NOM for selecting a more optimal regimen for patients with LARC.\nMETHODS AND ANALYSIS: NOMINATE trial is a prospective, multicentre, randomised phase II selection design study. Patients must have clinical stage II or III (T3-T4Nany) LARC with distal location (\u22645\u2009cm from the anal verge or for those who are candidates for abdominoperineal resection or intersphincteric resection). Patients will be randomised to either arm A consisting of CRT (50.4\u2009Gy with capecitabine) followed by consolidation chemotherapy (six cycles of CapeOx), or arm B consisting of induction chemotherapy (three cycles of CapeOx plus bevacizumab) followed by CRT and consolidation chemotherapy (three cycles of CapeOx). In the case of clinical complete response (cCR) or near cCR, patients will progress to NOM. Response assessment involves a combination of digital rectal examination, endoscopy and MRI. The primary endpoint is the proportion of patients achieving pathological CR or cCR\u22652 years, defined as the absence of local regrowth within 2 years after the start of NOM among eligible patients. Secondary endpoints include the cCR rate, near cCR rate, rate of NOM, overall survival, distant metastasis-free survival, locoregional failure-free survival, time to disease-related treatment failure, TME-free survival, permanent stoma-free survival, safety of the treatment, completion rate of the treatment and QOL.

Previous research on R-SNAREs has mainly focused on development and growth and has rarely been involved in abiotic stress, especially in cotton. Here, we performed a comprehensive analysis of R-SNARE genes in upland cotton. In total, 51 Gh-R-SNARE genes across six phylogenetic groups were unevenly distributed on 21 chromosomes.

In\u00a0vitro experiments demonstrate that while the I209N NSF protein recognizes SNARE complexes, the effects on disassembly are dependent upon the type of SNARE complex and I209N concentration. Higher levels of I209N protein produce a modest decrease in binary (syntaxin-SNAP-25) SNARE complex disassembly and residual ternary (syntaxin-1A-SNAP-25-synaptobrevin-2) disassembly, whereas at lower concentrations binary disassembly activity is strongly reduced and ternary disassembly activity is absent.

These SNARE complexes then dissociate so that the Q-SNAREs and R-SNAREs can repeat this cycle. Whilst the basic function of SNAREs has been long appreciated, it is becoming increasingly clear that the cell can control the localisation and function of SNARE proteins through posttranslational modifications (PTMs), such as phosphorylation and ubiquitylation. Whilst numerous proteomic methods have shown that SNARE proteins are subject to these modifications, little is known about how these modifications regulate SNARE function. However, it is clear that these PTMs provide cells with an incredible functional plasticity; SNARE PTMs enable cells to respond to an ever-changing extracellular environment through the rerouting of membrane traffic.

The etiology of the development and progression of cancer is multifactorial. Insights have been gained on the association between the human microbiome and tumor cell malignancy. A number of commensal microbe species are present in the human gut. They serve pivotal roles in maintaining several health and disease conditions, such as inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, obesity and diabetes. Known major factors involved in cancer development include age, hormone levels, alcohol consumption, diet, being overweight, obesity, and infections, regardless of the type of cancer. Therefore, the present review aims to discuss the relationship between the gut microbiome and obesity\u2011associated malignancies, including colorectal, gastric and liver cancer. Obesity has been reported to contribute to the development of numerous types of cancer primarily caused by high fatty food intake. In addition, obesity\u2011associated microbiome alterations can lead to cancer and its progression. Dysbiosis of the gut microbiota can alter the metabolite profile, whilst increasing the levels of toxins, such as Bacteroides\u00a0fragilis toxin and colibactin and cytolethal distending toxin, which are responsible for oncogenesis. The present review provides insights into the impact of gut microbiome dysbiosis on the progression of different types of cancers associated with obesity. It also discusses possible strategies for preserving a healthy gut microbiome.

This results in a chronic inability to regulate blood glucose levels. The natural history of T1D is well-characterized in childhood. Evidence of two or more autoantibodies to the islet antigens insulin, GAD, IA-2 or ZnT8 in early childhood is associated with high risk of developing T1D in the future. Prediction of risk is less clear in adults and, overall, the factors controlling the progression rate from multiple islet autoantibody positivity to onset of symptoms are not fully understood. An anti-CD3 antibody, teplizumab, was recently shown to delay clinical progression to T1D in high-risk individuals including adults and older children. This represents an important proof of concept for those at risk of future T1D. Given their role in risk assessment, islet autoantibodies might appear to be the most obvious biomarkers to monitor efficacy. However, monitoring islet autoantibodies in clinical trials has shown only limited effects, although antibodies to the most recently identified autoantigen, tetraspanin-7, have not yet been studied in this context. Measurements of beta cell function remain fundamental to assessing efficacy and different models have been proposed, but improved biomarkers are required for both progression studies before onset of diabetes and in therapeutic monitoring.

It is associated with an increased morbidity and mortality from diabetes-related complications and a significant treatment burden. However, there has been substantial progress in therapeutic strategies that can affect the course of the disease.\nSUMMARY: This review addresses advances in immunotherapy aimed at preserving residual beta-cell function in individuals with a recent onset of T1D and arresting the disease in pre-symptomatic stages. Recent and ongoing clinical trials have investigated the efficacy and safety of various immunotherapeutic strategies aimed at targeting several mechanisms of autoimmunity, which are thought to be important in disease pathogenesis, and therapies that also address beta-cell health. So far, T-cell-directed therapies that led to a favourable balance between T-effector cell depletion or modulation and preservation or expansion of regulatory T cells have shown the most success. Furthermore, regarding the timing of intervention, teplizumab was the first immunomodulatory agent to demonstrate a significant delay in disease progression in high-risk individuals before clinical onset.\nKEY MESSAGES: As more targeted immune interventions with potentially fewer side effects are closer to the translation into clinical practice, some new challenges may need to be addressed. The use of combination approaches that include immunotherapeutic strategies targeting different aspects of the immune system and interventions that improve beta-cell health may be required, along with the use of individualized patient-tailored approaches, a move towards early intervention, and a focus on patient-reported outcome measures.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36741943": "CONTEXT: Participants with stage 1 or 2 type 1 diabetes (T1D) qualify for prevention trials, but factors involved in screening for such trials are largely unknown.\nOBJECTIVE: To identify factors associated with screening for T1D prevention trials.\nMETHODS: This study included TrialNet Pathway to Prevention participants who were eligible for a prevention trial: oral insulin (TN-07, TN-20), teplizumab (TN-10), abatacept (TN-18), and oral hydroxychloroquine (TN-22). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to examine participant, site, and study factors at the time of prevention trial accrual.\nRESULTS: Screening rates for trials were: 50% for TN-07 (584 screened/1172 eligible), 9% for TN-10 (106/1249), 24% for TN-18 (313/1285), 17% for TN-20 (113/667), and 28% for TN-22 (371/1336).

Using best tumor response assessments, real-world overall response rates (rwORR) and disease control rates (rwDCR) were described and analyzed using logistic regression. Survival rate was examined for each month after index therapy using Kaplan-Meier. Overall survival (OS) was assessed using Cox proportional hazards models. Subgroup analyses among patients with index therapy as second- or third-line were performed.\nRESULTS: One hundred twenty-six and 95 patients were treated with FTD/TPI or regorafenib as index therapy, respectively. Patients treated with FTD/TPI versus regorafenib had a better response (rwORR 52.5% vs. 34.2%; adjusted odds ratio [OR]\u00a0=\u20092.6; all p value <.05; rwDCR 64.2% vs. 46.1%; adjusted OR\u00a0=\u00a02.5; all p value <.05).

Crystal structures of the eEF2-ETA complexes with three different ligands NAD+, ADP-ribose, and \u03b2TAD were selected and compared in the diphthamide and histidine containing systems. The study shows that NAD+ bound to ETA remains very stable in comparison with other ligands, enabling the transfer of ADP-ribose to the N3 atom of the diphthamide imidazole ring in eEF2 during ribosylation. We also show that unmodified histidine in eEF2 has a negative impact on ETA binding and is not a suitable target for the attachment of ADP-ribose.

Ribosome profiling of yeast and mammalian cells lacking DPH reveals increased ribosomal drop-off during elongation, and removal of out-of-frame stop codons restores ribosomal processivity on the ultralong yeast MDN1 mRNA. Finally, we show that ADP-ribosylation of DPH impairs the productive binding of eEF2 to elongating ribosomes. Our results reveal that loss of DPH impairs the fidelity of translocation during translation elongation resulting in increased rates of ribosomal frameshifting throughout elongation and leading to premature termination at out-of-frame stop codons.

Earlier studies showed that DPH1, also known as ovarian cancer-associated gene 1 (OVCA1), is involved in ovarian carcinogenesis. However, the role of DPH1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. To investigate the impact of DPH1 in hepatocellular carcinogenesis, we performed data mining from The Cancer Genome Atlas Liver Hepatocellular Carcinoma (TCGA-LIHC) dataset. We found that reduced DPH1 levels were associated with advanced stages and poor survival of patients with HCC. Also, we generated hepatocyte-specific Dph1-deficient mice and showed that diphthamide-deficient EEF2 resulted in a reduced translation elongation rate in the hepatocytes and led to mild liver damage with fatty accumulation. After N-diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced acute liver injury, p53-mediated pericentral hepatocyte death was increased, and compensatory proliferation was reduced in Dph1-deficient mice. Consistent with these effects, Dph1 deficiency decreased the incidence of DEN-induced pericentral-derived HCC and revealed a protective effect against p53 loss. In contrast, Dph1 deficiency combined with Trp53- or Trp53/Pten-deficient hepatocytes led to increased tumor loads associated with KRT19 (K19)-positive periportal-like cell expansion in mice. Further gene set enrichment analysis also revealed that HCC patients with lower levels of DPH1 and TP53 expression had enriched gene-sets related to the cell cycle and K19-upregulated HCC. Additionally, liver tumor organoids obtained from 6-month-old Pten/Trp53/Dph1-triple-mutant mice had a higher frequency of organoid re-initiation cells and higher proliferative index compared with those of the Pten/Trp53-double-mutant. Pten/Trp53/Dph1-triple-mutant liver tumor organoids showed expression of genes associated with stem/progenitor phenotypes, including Krt19 and Prominin-1 (Cd133) progenitor markers, combined with low hepatocyte-expressed fibrinogen genes.

Diphthamide biosynthesis depends on the 4Fe-4S-cluster protein Dph1 catalyzing the first committed step, as well as Dph2 to Dph7, in yeast and mammals. Here we show that diphthamide modification of eEF2 is conserved in Arabidopsis thaliana and requires AtDPH1. Ribosomal -1 frameshifting-error rates are increased in Arabidopsis dph1 mutants, similar to yeast and mice. Compared to the wild type, shorter roots and smaller rosettes of dph1 mutants result from fewer formed cells. TARGET OF RAPAMYCIN (TOR) kinase activity is attenuated, and autophagy is activated, in dph1 mutants. Under abiotic stress diphthamide-unmodified eEF2 accumulates in wild-type seedlings, most strongly upon heavy metal excess, which is conserved in human cells.

Although this notion emphasizes the pathological importance of diphthamide, precisely why cells including our own require EF2 to carry it, is unclear. Mining the synthetic genetic array (SGA) landscape from the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has revealed negative interactions between EF2 (EFT1-EFT2) and diphthamide (DPH1-DPH7) gene deletions. In line with these correlations, we confirm in here that loss of diphthamide modification (dph\u0394) on EF2 combined with EF2 undersupply (eft2\u0394) causes synthetic growth phenotypes in the composite mutant (dph\u0394 eft2\u0394). These reflect negative interference with cell performance under standard as well as thermal and/or chemical stress conditions, cell growth rates and doubling times, competitive fitness, cell viability in the presence of TOR inhibitors (rapamycin, caffeine) and translation indicator drugs (hygromycin, anisomycin).

The purpose of this study was to assess the efficacy of rabies control policies in Japan, which resulted in the elimination of the disease from the country in 1957. Using historical records from the Kanto region (Chiba, Kanagawa, Saitama and Tokyo Prefectures) between 1947 and 1956 where the final canine cases were recorded, we undertook a descriptive epidemiological study, applying spatio-temporal scan statistics using SaTScan and estimating the effective reproduction number (R<sub>t</sub> ) for the clusters and each prefecture using the growth rates. There were 1,567 dog rabies and 161 human rabies cases recorded during this period. Vaccination coverage in registered dogs was over 70% after 1951, with much lower coverage in free-roaming and unregistered dogs. Eight clusters of dog rabies cases were identified: the first appeared in 1947 in Tokyo and was linked to three further clusters in peripheral prefectures between 1947 and 1951. Three more clusters occurred in Tokyo again between 1952 and 1954, and the last cluster was in Tokyo and Kanagawa between 1955 and 1956. R<sub>t</sub> in the first cluster was 1.68, and R<sub>t</sub> values in the others ranged between 1.18 and 1.86, with an exception of 4.05 in the smallest cluster in Tokyo in 1952 (10 cases). The moving average of R<sub>t</sub> coincided with the clusters. As dog vaccination and dog management progressed, and the number of dog rabies cases declined, the moving average of R<sub>t</sub> declined to below 1.

Initially, the study was designed as a single-cohort study, which was expanded following an interim analysis to include more patients. Initially, patients were given tucatinib (300 mg orally twice daily) plus intravenous trastuzumab (8 mg/kg as an initial loading dose, then 6 mg/kg every 21 days; cohort A) for the duration of treatment (until progression), and after expansion, patients were randomly assigned (4:3), using an interactive web response system and stratified by primary tumour location, to either tucatinib plus trastuzumab (cohort B) or tucatinib monotherapy (cohort C). The primary endpoint was confirmed objective response rate per blinded independent central review (BICR) for cohorts A and B combined and was assessed in patients in the full analysis set (ie, patients with HER2-positive disease who received at least one dose of study treatment).

Recent evidence indicates that anti-ERBB2 therapeutic strategies are active in patients with ERBB2-positive metastatic colorectal cancer and could potentially represent a new standard-of-care.\nOBSERVATIONS: The protein ERBB2 is a member of a family of epidermal growth factor receptors that also includes epidermal growth factor receptor (ERBB1), ERBB3, and ERBB4. Amplification of ERBB2 leads to overexpression of the ERBB2 tyrosine kinase receptor, resulting in aberrant signaling and cell migration, growth, adhesion, and differentiation.

We propose a Bayesian approach to sample size determination in basket trials that permit borrowing of information between commensurate subsets. Specifically, we consider a randomized basket trial design where patients are randomly assigned to the new treatment or control within each trial subset (\"subtrial\" for short). Closed-form sample size formulae are derived to ensure that each subtrial has a specified chance of correctly deciding whether the new treatment is superior to or not better than the control by some clinically relevant difference. Given prespecified levels of pairwise (in)commensurability, the subtrial sample sizes are solved simultaneously. The proposed Bayesian approach resembles the frequentist formulation of the problem in yielding comparable sample sizes for circumstances of no borrowing. When borrowing is enabled between commensurate subtrials, a considerably smaller trial sample size is required compared to the widely implemented approach of no borrowing. We illustrate the use of our sample size formulae with two examples based on real basket trials.

It is therefore natural to develop a biomarker-based basket design to allow the prospective enrichment of the trials with the adaptive selection of the biomarker-positive (BM+) subjects who are most sensitive to the experimental treatment. We propose a two-stage phase II adaptive biomarker basket (ABB) design based on a potential predictive biomarker measured on a continuous scale. At Stage 1, the design incorporates a biomarker cutoff estimation procedure via a hierarchical Bayesian model with biomarker as a covariate (HBMbc). At Stage 2, the design enrolls only BM+ subjects, defined as those with the biomarker values exceeding the biomarker cutoff within each cancer type, and subsequently assesses the early efficacy and/or futility stopping through the pre-defined interim analyses. At the end of the trial, the response rate of all BM+ subjects for each cancer type can guide drug development, while the data from all subjects can be used to further model the relationship between the biomarker value and the clinical outcome for potential future research. The extensive simulation studies show that the ABB design could produce a good estimate of the biomarker cutoff to select BM+ subjects with high accuracy and could outperform the existing phase II basket biomarker cutoff design under various scenarios.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28098411": "The landscape for early phase cancer clinical trials is changing dramatically because of the advent of targeted therapy. Increasingly, new drugs are designed to work against a target such as the presence of a specific tumor mutation. Because typically only a small proportion of cancer patients will possess the mutational target, but the mutation is present in many different cancers, a new class of basket trials is emerging, whereby the drug is tested simultaneously in different baskets, that is, subgroups of different tumor types. Investigators desire not only to test whether the drug works but also to determine which types of tumors are sensitive to the drug. A natural strategy is to conduct parallel trials, with the drug 's effectiveness being tested separately, using for example, the popular Simon two-stage design independently in each basket. The work presented is motivated by the premise that the efficiency of this strategy can be improved by assessing the homogeneity of the baskets ' response rates at an interim analysis and aggregating the baskets in the second stage if the results suggest the drug might be effective in all or most baskets. Via simulations, we assess the relative efficiencies of the two strategies. Because the operating characteristics depend on how many tumor types are sensitive to the drug, there is no uniformly efficient strategy.

In this article, we extend the key ideas to disease areas outside of oncology, developing a robust Bayesian methodology for randomized, placebo-controlled basket trials with a continuous endpoint to enable borrowing of information across subtrials with similar treatment effects. After adjusting for covariates, information from a complementary subtrial can be represented into a commensurate prior for the parameter that underpins the subtrial under consideration. We propose using distributional discrepancy to characterize the commensurability between subtrials for appropriate borrowing of information through a spike-and-slab prior, which is placed on the prior precision factor. When the basket trial has at least three subtrials, commensurate priors for point-to-point borrowing are combined into a marginal predictive prior, according to the weights transformed from the pairwise discrepancy measures. In this way, only information from subtrial(s) with the most commensurate treatment effect is leveraged. The marginal predictive prior is updated to a robust posterior by the contemporary subtrial data to inform decision making. Operating characteristics of the proposed methodology are evaluated through simulations motivated by a real basket trial in chronic diseases. The proposed methodology has advantages compared to other selected Bayesian analysis models, for (i) identifying the most commensurate source of information and (ii) gauging the degree of borrowing from specific subtrials. Numerical results also suggest that our methodology can improve the precision of estimates and, potentially, the statistical power for hypothesis testing.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37546121": "Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic autoimmune disorder characterized by an immune-mediated response to gluten, resulting in small intestinal mucosal damage. While gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms are commonly associated with CD, atypical presentations can pose diagnostic challenges, particularly when hematological abnormalities are the primary manifestation. We report a case of a 52-year-old female patient who presented with paraesthesia, numbness in her hands and feet, marked thinness, extreme thrombocytosis, severe anemia, and mild electrolyte imbalance. Physical examination was unremarkable, except for the notable thinness. GI symptoms were absent, and there was no family history of gastroenterological diseases. Diagnostic evaluations, including serological tests and duodenal biopsy, confirmed the diagnosis of CD with grade 4 Marsh 3C classification. This case emphasizes the significance of considering CD as a potential cause for atypical hematological manifestations, such as extreme thrombocytosis secondary to severe anemia. Prompt recognition and appropriate management, including adherence to a gluten-free diet, can lead to symptom improvement and resolution of hematological abnormalities.

Here, we assess the safety and efficacy of GTN in the prespecified subgroup of patients who had an ischaemic stroke within the Rapid Intervention with Glyceryl trinitrate in Hypertensive stroke Trial-2 (RIGHT-2).\nMETHODS: RIGHT-2 was an ambulance-based multicentre sham-controlled blinded-endpoint study with patients randomised within 4\u2009hours of onset. The primary outcome was a shift in scores on the modified Rankin scale (mRS) at day 90. Secondary outcomes included death; a global analysis (Wei-Lachin test) containing Barthel Index, EuroQol-5D, mRS, telephone interview for cognitive status-modified and Zung depression scale; and neuroimaging-determined 'brain frailty' markers.

It has made great breakthroughs in the treatment of some epithelial tumors and hematological tumors. However, its adverse reactions are common or even more serious, and the response rate in some solid tumors is not satisfactory. With the maturity of genomics and metabolomics technologies, the effect of intestinal microbiota in tumor development and treatment has gradually been recognized. The microbiota may affect tumor immunity by regulating the host immune system and tumor microenvironment. Some bacteria help fight tumors by activating immunity, while some bacteria mediate immunosuppression to help cancer cells escape from the immune system. More and more studies have revealed that the effects and complications of tumor immunotherapy are related to the composition of the gut microbiota. The composition of the intestinal microbiota that is sensitive to treatment or prone to adverse reactions has certain characteristics. These characteristics may be used as biomarkers to predict the prognosis of immunotherapy and may also be developed as \"immune potentiators\" to assist immunotherapy. Some clinical and preclinical studies have proved that microbial intervention, including microbial transplantation, can improve the sensitivity of immunotherapy or reduce adverse reactions to a certain extent. With the development of gene editing technology and nanotechnology, the design and development of engineered bacteria that contribute to immunotherapy has become a new research hotspot. Based on the relationship between the intestinal microbiota and immunotherapy, the correct mining of microbial information and the development of reasonable and feasible microbial intervention methods are expected to optimize tumor immunotherapy to a large extent and bring new breakthroughs in tumor treatment.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35488243": "The gut microbiota have long been recognized to play a key role in human health and disease. Currently, several lines of evidence from preclinical to clinical research have gradually established that the gut microbiota can modulate antitumor immunity and affect the efficacy of cancer immunotherapies, especially immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Deciphering the underlying mechanisms reveals that the gut microbiota reprogram the immunity of the tumor microenvironment (TME) by engaging innate and/or adaptive immune cells. Notably, one of the primary modes by which the gut microbiota modulate antitumor immunity is by means of metabolites, which are small molecules that could spread from their initial location of the gut and impact local and systemic antitumor immune response to promote ICI efficiency. Mechanistic exploration provides novel insights for developing rational microbiota-based therapeutic strategies by manipulating gut microbiota, such as fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), probiotics, engineered microbiomes, and specific microbial metabolites, to augment the efficacy of ICI and advance the age utilization of microbiota precision medicine.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34003768": "Several landmark preclinical studies have shown an association between the gut microbiota and the effectiveness of immunotherapy for cancer.

Despite this, the mechanisms through which the gut microbiota influences the effectiveness of immunotherapy are still incompletely characterized. Preclinical and preliminary clinical findings from numerous types of gut microbiota modulation studies, including fecal transplantation, probiotics, consortia, and diet, demonstrate that favorable microbiota modulation is associated with increased intratumoral infiltration of CD8+ effector T cells. This CD8+ T-cell infiltration is often associated with enhanced intratumoral activity of T-helper type 1 cells and dendritic cells and a lower density of immunosuppressive cells. Herein, we discuss how gut microbiota may affect the activity of immune cells by at least three interlacing mechanisms: activation of pattern recognition receptors, molecular mimicry, and impact of metabolites.

The human DPH1 syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder associated with developmental delay, abnormal head circumference (microcephaly or macrocephaly), short stature, and congenital heart disease. It is defined by variants with reduced functionality of the DPH1 gene\u00a0observed so far predominantly in consanguineous homozygous patients carrying identical mutant alleles of DPH1.

This study aimed to investigate the lifetime cost-effective value of IDegLira compared with its single component (Degludec or Liraglutide) and to explore the suitable annual cost of IDegLira if necessary. Methods: UKPDS OM2 was applied to determine the long-term quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and total costs. The efficacy data that were inputted into the model were synthesized from 6 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that directly assessed the clinical benefit of IDegLira and its components in the treatment of uncontrolled T2D patients. The economic results were examined by one-way sensitivity analysis (OSA) and probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA). Further price reduction of IDegLira was investigated by binary search. Results: The IDegLira, IDeg, and Lira yielded 11.79 QALYs, 11.62 QALYs, and 11.73 QALYs and total cost of $20281.61, $3726.76, and $11941.26, respectively. The incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR) of IDegLira versus IDeg was $99464.12/QALYs, and the ICUR of IDegLira versus Lira was $143348.26/QALYs, which indicated that IDegLira was not a cost-effective therapy for T2D patients compared with its components at the current price from a Chinese national healthcare system perspective.

Insulin degludec is characterized by an original mode of prolonged and continuous insulin diffusion after its subcutaneous injection. Thereby, it has a very long half-life, around 25 hours, and a better reproducibility from both a pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic point of view, with less hypoglycaemia, especially at night. Liraglutide is a well-known once-daily GLP-1 receptor agonist that showed a cardiovascular and renal protection in patients with type 2 diabetes at high cardiovascular risk. Both molecules exert complementary antihyperglycaemic effects, which allows a better glucose control, both in the fasting and postprandial states. IDegLira is more effective than another basal insulin regimen in reaching individualized glycated haemoglobin target, with a lower daily dose of insulin. It has a better tolerance profile, with a more favourable effect on body weight and less hypoglycaemia compared with a basal insulin and less gastrointestinal adverse effects when compared with liraglutide alone. Xultophy\u00ae is presented as a prefilled pen and is indicated in the management of type 2 diabetes not well controlled with basal insulin. The dose of IDegLira is progressively uptitrated, starting from 16 dose steps up to a maximum of 50 dose steps per day (corresponding to 50 IU insulin degludec and 1.8 mg liraglutide).", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30006093": "AIMS: Xultophy is the first fixed co-formulation pen containing insulin degludec and the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue liraglutide, authorized for type 2 diabetes patients since 2014.

Xultophy was well-tolerated, however, abdominal cramps and nausea limited use in three patients. Baseline HbA1c and weight were 84.7\u202fmmol/mol and 101.5\u202fkg. There were significant HbA1c reductions of 9.9\u202fmmol/mol (p\u202f<\u202f0.0001) and 13.4\u202fmmol/mol (p\u202f<\u202f0.008) at 6 and 12 months, and non-significant changes in weight. Patients with an HbA1c over 84\u202fmmol/mol showed the greatest HbA1c improvement over 6-months. Those prescribed insulin prior to Xultophy had less significant improvements in HbA1c than those previously prescribed GLP-1 analogues.\nCONCLUSIONS: There were significant reductions in HbA1c and statistically insignificant weight gain over 12 months.

The influences of UGT1A and DPYD polymorphisms on severe irinotecan-induced toxicities and clinical outcomes were assessed.\nRESULTS: In the cohort studied here, the incidence of UGT1A1*6, UGT1A1*28, UGT1A7*2, UGT1A7*3, UGT1A9*22, DPYD*5, and DPYD c.1896\u00a0T\u00a0>\u00a0C variants were 34.8%, 24.2%, 34.3%, 39.4%, 81.8%, 48.4% and 20.4%, respectively. UGT1A1*27 and DPYD*2A had low frequencies and UGT1A7*4 was not found. A total of 59 patients (8.9%) suffered severe diarrhea and 136 patients (20.6%) suffered severe neutropenia. UGT1A1*28 heterozygotes (OR\u00a0=\u00a02.263, 95%CI 1.395-3.670), UGT1A1*28 homozygotes (OR\u00a0=\u00a05.910, 95%CI 1.138-30.672) and UGT1A1*6 homozygotes (OR\u00a0=\u00a04.737, 95%CI 1.946-11.533) were independent risk factors for severe neutropenia.

Observational studies indicate a significant association between UGT1A1 genotypes, particularly *28/*28 and *1/*28, and the occurrence of severe neutropenia. Observational studies also indicate a possible association between severe diarrhea and these UGT1A1 genotypes, but the association is not statistically significant. An additional finding was the suggestion that reducing irinotecan dose may result in patient harms due to diminished effectiveness of treatment in highest risk individuals (*28/*28 homozygotes), and that a higher dose might be warranted among individuals at lower risk of adverse drug events (*1/*1 and *1/*28 genotypes). This review did not consider higher risk patients (e.g., having previous adverse reactions to irinotecan or additional risk factors for neutropenia).\nANALYTIC VALIDITY: The EWG found adequate evidence to conclude that analytic sensitivity and specificity were high for the commonly tested alleles, but evidence was inadequate for rarer alleles.\nCLINICAL VALIDITY: The EWG found adequate evidence of a significant association between UGT1A1 genotype and the incidence of severe neutropenia at standard doses of irinotecan. The EWG found adequate evidence of a possible association between genotype and severe diarrhea, but the effect was smaller and not statistically significant. The EWG found adequate evidence of a significantly higher rate of tumor response to standard irinotecan dosing among individuals with the genotype at highest risk of adverse drug events (*28/*28).\nCLINICAL UTILITY: The EWG found no evidence to support clinical utility in the proposed clinical scenario. Preliminary modeling suggests that, even if targeted dosing were to be highly effective, it is not clear that benefits (reduced adverse drug events) outweigh harms (unresponsive tumors).\nCONTEXTUAL ISSUES: Addressing patient preferences regarding risk of side effects and quality of life, versus aggressive treatment to potentially improve effectiveness, is expected practice. In addition, a recent study reported that risk for neutropenia was lower at lower irinotecan doses. For treatment regimens utilizing lower irinotecan doses, UGT1A1 genotype may not be a useful indicator of risk for adverse drug events.

Data were retrospectively collected.\nRESULTS: 292 patients were enrolled, including 23 UGT1A1*28/*28 homozygous (7.9%), 137 wild type homozygous (46.9%) and 132 heterozygous (45.2%). There were no significant differences in phenotypic colonic characteristics between homozygous and heterozygous patients carrying the UGT1A1*28 allele as compared to *1/*1 homozygous.

No studies were identified that addressed this question directly. The quality of evidence on the analytic validity of current UGT1A1 genetic testing methods is adequate (scale: convincing, adequate, inadequate), with available data indicating that both analytic sensitivity and specificity for the common genotypes are high. For clinical validity, the quality of evidence is adequate for studies reporting concentration of the active form of irinotecan (SN-38), presence of severe diarrhea, and presence of severe neutropenia stratified by UGT1A1 common genotypes. The strongest association for a clinical endpoint is for severe neutropenia. Patients homozygous for the *28 allele are 3.5 times more likely to develop severe neutropenia compared with individuals with the wild genotype (risk ratio 3.51; 95% confidence interval 2.03-6.07). The proposed clinical utility of UGT1A1 genotyping would be derived from a reduction in drug-related adverse reactions (benefits) while at the same time avoiding declines in tumor response rate and increases in morbidity/mortality (harms). At least three treatment options for reducing this increased risk have been suggested: modification of the irinotecan regime (e.g., reduce initial dose), use of other drugs, and/or pretreatment with colony-stimulating factors. However, we found no prospective studies that examined these options, particularly whether a reduced dose of irinotecan results in a reduced rate of adverse drug events. This is a major gap in knowledge. Although the quality of evidence on clinical utility is inadequate, two of three reviewed studies (and one published since our initial selection of studies for review) found that individuals homozygous for the *28 allele had improved survival. Three reviewed studies found statistically significant higher tumor response rates among individuals homozygous for the *28 allele. We found little or no direct evidence to assess the benefits and harms of modifying irinotecan regimens for patients with colorectal cancer based on their UGT1A1 genotype; however, results of our preliminary modeling of prevalence, acceptance, and effectiveness indicate that reducing the dose would need to be highly effective to have benefits outweigh harms. An alternative is to increase irinotecan dose among wild-type individuals to improve tumor response with minimal increases in adverse drug events. Given the large number of colorectal cancer cases diagnosed each year, a randomized controlled trial of the effects of irinotecan dose modifications in patients with colorectal cancer based on their UGT1A1 genotype is feasible and could clarify the tradeoffs between possible reductions in severe neutropenia and improved tumor response and/or survival in patients with various UGT1A1 genotypes.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36410877": "In recent years, autologous biological preparations have emerged as a growing area of medical innovation in interventional orthopedical procedures and surgical interventions.

Unfortunately, completion rates are suboptimal overall, and disparities may exist, especially for vulnerable groups. We assessed whether implementing an initiative to standardize advance directives discussions during preanesthesia visits was associated with changes in rates of advance directives completion over time, and whether the association depends on race, insurance type, or income.\nMETHODS: We conducted a before-after interrupted time series evaluation between January 1, 2015 and June 30, 2019 in a single-center, outpatient preanesthesia clinic. Participants were adults who visited the preanesthesia clinic at Cleveland Clinic and had >1 comorbidity before a noncardiac surgery of either medium or high risk. The intervention in March of 2017 consisted of training staff to help patients complete and witness advance directives documents during visits. We measured advance directives completion, by race, payor, and income (using the 2019 Federal Poverty Line). We assessed the confounder-adjusted association between intervention (pre versus post) and proportion of patients completing advanced directives over time using segmented regression to compare slopes between periods and assess changes at start of the intervention. We used similar models to assess whether changes depended on race, insurance type, or income level.\nRESULTS: We included 26,368 visits from 22,430 patients. We analyzed financial status for 16,788 visits from 14,274 patients who had address data. There were 11,242 (43%) visits preintervention and 15,126 (57%) visits postintervention. Crude completion rates for advance directives increased from 29% to 78%, with odds of completion an estimated 18 times higher than preintervention (odds ratio [95% CI] of 18 [16-21]; P < 0.001). Regarding race, Black patients had lower completion rates preintervention than White patients, although the gap steadily closed after the intervention ( P = .001). Postintervention, both race groups immediately increased, with no difference in amount of increase ( P = .17) or postintervention change in slope difference ( P = .17). Regarding insurance, patients with Medicaid had lower preintervention completion rates than those with private. Intervention was associated with increases in both groups, but the difference in slopes ( P = .43) or proportions ( P = .23) between the groups did not change after intervention.

Less is known about the use of advance directives between veteran and non-veteran older Americans. Using data from the decedents of a longitudinal survey, we explore whether there is a difference in having an established advance directive between the veteran and non-veteran decedents. Data were taken from the Harmonized End of Life data sets, a linked collection of variables derived from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) Exit Interview. Only male decedents were included in the current analysis (N = 4828). The dependent variable, having an established advance directive, was measured by asking the proxy, \"whether the deceased respondent ever provided written instructions about the treatment or care he/she wanted to receive during the final days of his/her life\" and \"whether the deceased respondent had a Durable Power of Attorney for healthcare?\" A \"yes\" to either of the two items was counted as having an advance directive. The independent variable, veteran status, was determined by asking participants, \"Have you ever served in the active military of the United States?\" at their first HRS core interview. Logistic regression was used to predict the likelihood of having an established advance directive. While there was no difference in having an advance directive between male veteran and non-veteran decedents during the earlier follow-up period (from 1992 to 2003), male veterans who died during the second half of the study period (from 2004 to 2014) were more likely to have an established advance directive than their non-veteran counterparts (OR = 1.24, p &lt; 0.05). Other factors positively associated with having an established advance directive include dying at older ages, higher educational attainment, needing assistance in activities of daily living and being bedridden three months before death, while Black decedents and those who were married were less likely to have an advance directive in place. Our findings suggest male veterans were more likely to have an established advance directive, an indicator for better end-of-life care, than their non-veteran counterparts. This observed difference coincides with a time when the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) increased its investment in end-of-life care.

However, patients with high microsatellite instability/deficient mismatch repair (MSI-H/dMMR) LACRC receive little benefit from neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) or neoadjuvant chemotherapy (nCT). The 2015 KEYNOTE-016 trial identified MSI-H/dMMR as a biomarker indicative of immunotherapy efficacy, and pointed to the potential use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). In 2017, the FDA approved two ICIs (pembrolizumab and nivolumab) for treatment of MSI-H/dMMR metastatic CRC (mCRC). In 2018, the CheckMate-142 trial demonstrated successful treatment of mCRC based on \"double immunity\" provided by nivolumab with ipilimumab, a regimen that may become a standard first-line treatment for MSI-H mCRC. In 2018, the FDA approved nivolumab alone or with ipilimumab for patients who progressed to MSI-H/dMMR mCRC after standard chemotherapy. The FDA then approved pembrolizumab alone as a first-line treatment for patients with MSI-H/dMMR CRC that was unresectable or metastatic. There is now interest in using these drugs in neoadjuvant immunotherapy (nIT) for patients with MSI-H/dMMR non-mCRC. In 2020, the NICHE trial marked the start of using nIT for CRC. This novel treatment of MSI-H/dMMR LACRC may change the approaches used for neoadjuvant therapy of other cancers. Our review of immunotherapy for CRC covers diagnosis and treatment, clinical prognostic characteristics, the mechanism of nIT, analysis of completed prospective and retrospective studies, and ongoing clinical trials, and the clinical practice of using nIT for MSI-H/dMMR LACRC.

However, no data are available concerning the safety of omitting surgery and adopting immunotherapy as a curative-intent treatment for these patients.\nMETHODS: We retrospectively collected a series of patients with dMMR/MSI-H rectal adenocarcinoma who had cCR after receiving anti-PD-1 immunotherapy and adopted immunotherapy as curative-intent treatment from six institutions. Survival outcomes were analysed using the Kaplan-Meier method.\nRESULTS: Nineteen patients were included with a median age of 48 (range\u00a019-63). One patient\u00a0was diagnosed with stage I disease, four with stage II disease and fourteen with stage III disease. Sixteen patients received anti-PD-1 immunotherapy as the first line of therapy, and eleven patients were treated with single-agent anti-PD-1 antibodies. The median time from the start of treatment to cCR was 3.8 (range\u00a00.7-6.5) months.

Among them, 32 patients were dMMR or MSI-H or both dMMR and MSI-H, and one patient was both dMMR and microsatellite stability (MSS) (excluded in the final analysis). All 32 patients received neoadjuvant immunotherapy (nIT) with single-agent PD\u20431 inhibitor.\nRESULTS: Among the 32 patients, 8 (25%) were locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) and 24 (75%) were locally advanced colon cancer (LACC); 4 (12.55%) were stage II and 28 (87.5%) were stage III. The median number of cycles of 32 patients with dMMR/MSI-H LACRC receiving nIT with single-agent PD-1 blockade was 6 (4~10), and the median number of cycles to achieve partial response (PR) was 3 (2~4). Among them, three LARC patients achieved clinical complete response (cCR) and adopted the watch-and-wait (W&W) strategy.

FA metabolism has been reported to play an important role in viral replications; however, the roles of FA metabolism in the antiviral innate immune response are unclear.\nOBJECTIVE: To evaluate the potential regulatory role of FA metabolism in antiviral innate immune response, we establish the model of FA deficiency (FAD) in vitro and in vivo. The molecular and functional effects of FAD on 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetases (OAS)-associated antiviral innate immunity pathways were assessed; and the potential relationship between FA metabolism and the axis of adenosine deaminases acting on RNA 3 (ADAR3)/endogenous double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)/OAS was further explored in the present study, as well as the potential translatability of these findings in vivo.\nMETHODS: FA-free RPMI 1640 medium and FA-free feed were used to establish the model of FAD in vitro and in vivo. And FA and homocysteine (Hcy) concentrations in cell culture supernatants and serum were used for FAD model evaluation. Ribonucleoprotein immunoprecipitation assay was used to enrich endogenous dsRNA, and dot-blot was further used for quantitative analysis of endogenous dsRNA. Western-blot assay, RNA isolation and quantitative real-time PCR, immunofluorescence assay, and other molecular biology techniques were used for exploring the potential mechanisms.\nRESULTS: In this study, we observed that FA metabolism negatively regulated OAS-mediated antiviral innate immune response. Mechanistically, FAD induced ADAR3, which interacted with endogenous dsRNA, to inhibit deaminated adenosine (A) being converted into inosine (I), leading to the cytoplasmic accumulation of dsRNA. Furthermore, endogenous dsRNA accumulated in cytoplasm triggered the host immune activation, thus promoting the expression of OAS2 to suppress the replication of viruses. Additionally, injection of 8-Azaadenosine to experimental animals, an A-to-I editing inhibitor, efficiently enhanced OAS-mediated antiviral innate immune response to reduce the viral burden in vivo.\nCONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our present study provided a new perspective to illustrate a relationship between FA metabolism and the axis of ADAR3/endogenous dsRNA/OAS, and a new insight for the treatment of RNA viral infectious diseases by targeting the axis of ADAR3/endogenous dsRNA/OAS.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37665322": "One-carbon/folate (1C) metabolism supplies methyl groups required for DNA and histone methylation, and is involved in the maintenance of self-renewal in stem cells. Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), a key enzyme in 1C metabolism, is highly expressed in human and mouse neural progenitors at the early stages of neocortical development. Here, we have investigated the role of DHFR in the developing neocortex and report that reducing its activity in human neural organoids and mouse embryonic neocortex accelerates indirect neurogenesis, thereby affecting neuronal composition of the neocortex. Furthermore, we show that decreasing DHFR activity in neural progenitors leads to a reduction in one-carbon/folate metabolites and correlates with modifications of H3K4me3 levels. Our findings reveal an unanticipated role for DHFR in controlling specific steps of neocortex development and indicate that variations in 1C metabolic cues impact cell fate transitions.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35508111": "The folic acid cycle mediates the transfer of one-carbon (1C) units to support nucleotide biosynthesis.

We find high GCS flux in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), supporting nucleotide biosynthesis. Surprisingly, other than supplying 1C units, we found that GCS is important for maintaining protein lipoylation and mitochondrial activity.

C1 tetrahydrofolate (THF) synthase, encoded by Mthfd1, is an entry point of 1Cs into folate metabolism through its formyl-THF synthetase (FTHFS) activity that catalyzes the ATP-dependent conversion of formate and THF to 10-formyl-THF. Disruption of FTHFS activity by the insertion of a gene trap vector into the Mthfd1 gene results in embryonic lethality in mice. Mthfd1gt/+ mice demonstrated lower hepatic adenosylmethionine levels, which is consistent with formate serving as a source of 1Cs for cellular methylation reactions. Surprisingly, Mthfd1gt/+ mice exhibited decreased levels of uracil in nuclear DNA, indicating enhanced de novo thymidylate synthesis, and suggesting that serine hydroxymethyltransferase and FTHFS compete for a limiting pool of unsubstituted THF. This study demonstrates the essentiality of the Mthfd1 gene and indicates that formate-derived 1Cs are utilized for de novo purine synthesis and the remethylation of homocysteine in liver. Further, the depletion of cytoplasmic FTHFS activity enhances thymidylate synthesis, affirming the competition between thymidylate synthesis and homocysteine remethylation for THF cofactors.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29483189": "One-carbon (1C) metabolism is a universal folate-dependent pathway essential for de novo purine and thymidylate synthesis, amino acid interconversion, universal methyl-donor production, and regeneration of redox cofactors.

However, the specific metabolic processes that are perturbed by Mthfd1l deletion are not known. Here, we performed untargeted metabolomics on whole Mthfd1l-null and wildtype mouse embryos in combination with isotope tracer analysis in mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cell lines to identify Mthfd1l deletion-induced disruptions in 1C metabolism, glycolysis, and the TCA cycle. We found that maternal formate supplementation largely corrects these disruptions in Mthfd1l-null embryos. Serine tracer experiments revealed that Mthfd1l-null MEFs have altered methionine synthesis, indicating that Mthfd1l deletion impairs the methyl cycle. Supplementation of Mthfd1l-null MEFs with formate, hypoxanthine, or combined hypoxanthine and thymidine restored their growth to wildtype levels. Thymidine addition alone was ineffective, suggesting a purine synthesis defect in Mthfd1l-null MEFs. Tracer experiments also revealed lower proportions of labeled hypoxanthine and inosine monophosphate in Mthfd1l-null than in wildtype MEFs, suggesting that Mthfd1l deletion results in increased reliance on the purine salvage pathway.

Conflicting is also their usefulness in late preterm cases (between 34 and 37 weeks) or in cases of elective cesarean delivery at term.

We planned to exclude cross-over trials and cluster-randomised trials. We planned to include studies published as abstracts only along with studies published as full-text manuscripts.\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: At least two review authors independently assessed study eligibility, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. Data were checked for accuracy. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE.\nMAIN RESULTS: We included 11 trials (2494 women and 2762 infants) in this update, all of which recruited women who were at increased risk of preterm birth or had a medical indication for preterm birth.\u00a0All trials were conducted in high-income countries. Dexamethasone versus betamethasone Nine trials (2096 women and 2319 infants) compared dexamethasone versus betamethasone. All trials administered both drugs intramuscularly, and the total dose in the course was consistent (22.8 mg or 24 mg), but the regimen varied. We assessed one new study to have no serious risk of bias concerns for most outcomes, but other studies were at moderate (six trials) or high (two trials) risk of bias due to selection, detection and attrition bias. Our GRADE assessments ranged between high- and low-certainty, with downgrades due to risk of bias and imprecision.\u00a0 Maternal outcomes The only maternal primary outcome reported was chorioamnionitis (death and puerperal sepsis were not reported). Although the rate of chorioamnionitis was lower with dexamethasone, we did not find conclusive evidence of a difference between the two drugs (risk ratio (RR) 0.71, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.48 to 1.06; 1 trial, 1346 women;\u00a0moderate-certainty evidence). The proportion of women experiencing maternal adverse effects of therapy was lower with dexamethasone; however, there was not conclusive evidence of a difference between interventions (RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.13; 2 trials, 1705 women; moderate-certainty evidence). Infant outcomes We are unsure whether the choice of drug makes a difference to the risk of any known death after randomisation, because the 95% CI was compatible with both appreciable benefit and harm with dexamethasone (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.63; 5 trials, 2105 infants; moderate-certainty evidence). The choice of drug may make little or no difference to the risk of RDS (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.22; 5 trials, 2105 infants;\u00a0high-certainty evidence). While there may be little or no difference in the risk of intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH), there was substantial unexplained statistical heterogeneity in this result (average (a) RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.28 to 1.81; 4 trials, 1902 infants;\u00a0I\u00b2 = 62%; low-certainty evidence). We found no evidence of a difference between the two drugs for chronic lung disease (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.64 to 1.34; 1 trial, 1509 infants; moderate-certainty evidence), and we are unsure of the effects on necrotising enterocolitis, because there were few events in the studies reporting this outcome (RR 5.08, 95% CI 0.25 to 105.15; 2 studies, 441 infants; low-certainty evidence). Longer-term child outcomes Only one trial consistently followed up children longer term, reporting \u00a0at two years' adjusted age. There is probably little or no difference between dexamethasone and betamethasone in the risk of neurodevelopmental disability at follow-up (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.22; 2 trials, 1151 infants;\u00a0moderate-certainty evidence). It is unclear whether the choice of drug makes a difference to the risk of visual impairment (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.01 to 8.15; 1 trial, 1227 children; low-certainty evidence). There may be little or no difference between the drugs for hearing impairment (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.63 to 2.16; 1 trial, 1227 children; moderate-certainty evidence), motor developmental delay (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.20; 1 trial, 1166 children; moderate-certainty evidence) or intellectual impairment (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.20; 1 trial, 1161 children; moderate-certainty evidence). However, the effect estimate for cerebral palsy is compatible with both an important increase in risk with dexamethasone, and no difference between interventions (RR 2.50, 95% CI 0.97 to 6.39; 1 trial, 1223 children; low-certainty evidence). No trials followed the children beyond early childhood. Comparisons of different preparations and regimens of corticosteroids We found three studies that included a comparison of a different regimen or preparation of either dexamethasone or betamethasone (oral dexamethasone 32 mg versus intramuscular dexamethasone 24 mg; betamethasone acetate plus phosphate versus betamethasone phosphate; 12-hourly betamethasone versus 24-hourly betamethasone). The certainty of the evidence for the main outcomes from all three studies was very low, due to \u00a0small sample size and \u00a0risk of bias. Therefore, we were limited in our ability to draw conclusions from any of these studies.\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Overall, it remains unclear whether there are important differences between dexamethasone and betamethasone, or between one regimen and another.\u00a0 Most trials compared dexamethasone versus betamethasone. While for most infant and early childhood outcomes there may be no difference between these drugs, for several important outcomes for the mother, infant and child the evidence was inconclusive and did not rule out significant benefits or harms. The evidence on different antenatal corticosteroid regimens was sparse, and does not support the use of one particular corticosteroid regimen over another.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33368142": "BACKGROUND: Respiratory morbidity including respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is a serious complication of preterm birth and the primary cause of early neonatal mortality and disability.

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, assessed risk of bias, evaluated trustworthiness based on predefined criteria developed by Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth, extracted data and checked them for accuracy, and assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. Primary outcomes included perinatal death, neonatal death, RDS, intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH), birthweight, developmental delay in childhood and maternal death.\nMAIN RESULTS: We included 27\u00a0studies (11,272\u00a0randomised women and 11,925 neonates) from 20\u00a0countries. Ten trials (4422 randomised women) took place in lower- or middle-resource settings. We removed six trials from the analysis that were included in the previous version of the review; this review only includes trials that meet our pre-defined trustworthiness criteria. In 19 trials the women received a single course of steroids. In the remaining eight trials repeated courses may have been prescribed. Fifteen trials were judged to be at low risk of bias, two had a high risk of bias in two or more domains and we ten trials had a high risk of bias due to lack of blinding (placebo was not used in the control arm. Overall, the certainty of evidence was moderate to high, but it was downgraded for IVH due to indirectness; for developmental delay due to risk of bias and for maternal adverse outcomes (death, chorioamnionitis and endometritis) due to imprecision. Neonatal/child outcomes Antenatal corticosteroids reduce the risk of: -\u00a0perinatal death (risk ratio (RR) 0.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.77 to 0.93; 9833 infants; 14 studies; high-certainty evidence; 2.3% fewer, 95% CI 1.1% to 3.6% fewer), -\u00a0neonatal death (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.70\u00a0to 0.87; 10,609\u00a0infants; 22\u00a0studies; high-certainty evidence; 2.6% fewer, 95% CI 1.5% to 3.6% fewer), - respiratory distress syndrome (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.78; 11,183 infants; studies = 26; high-certainty evidence; 4.3% fewer, 95% CI 3.2% to 5.2% fewer). Antenatal corticosteroids probably reduce the risk of IVH (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.75; 8475 infants; 12 studies; moderate-certainty evidence; 1.4% fewer, 95% CI 0.8% to1.8% fewer), and probably have little to no effect on birthweight (mean difference (MD) -14.02 g, 95% CI -33.79 to 5.76; 9551 infants; 19 studies; high-certainty evidence). Antenatal corticosteroids probably lead to a reduction in developmental delay in childhood (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.97; 600 children; 3 studies; moderate-certainty evidence; 3.8% fewer, 95% CI 0.2% to 5.7% fewer). Maternal outcomes Antenatal corticosteroids probably result in little to no difference in maternal death (RR 1.19, 95% CI 0.36\u00a0to 3.89; 6244 women; 6 studies; moderate-certainty evidence; 0.0% fewer, 95% CI 0.1% fewer to 0.5% more), chorioamnionitis\u00a0(RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.69 to 1.08; 8374 women; 15 studies; moderate-certainty evidence; 0.5% fewer, 95% CI 1.1% fewer to 0.3% more), and endometritis (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.58; 6764 women; 10 studies; moderate-certainty; 0.3% more, 95% CI 0.3% fewer to 1.1% more) The wide 95% CIs in all of these outcomes include possible benefit and possible harm.\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Evidence from this updated review supports the continued use of a single course of antenatal corticosteroids to accelerate fetal lung maturation in women at risk of preterm birth. Treatment with antenatal corticosteroids reduces the risk of perinatal death, neonatal death and RDS and probably reduces the risk of IVH. This evidence is robust, regardless of resource setting (high, middle or low). Further research should focus on variations in the treatment regimen, effectiveness of the intervention in specific understudied subgroups such as multiple pregnancies and other high-risk obstetric groups, and the risks and benefits in the very early or very late preterm periods. Additionally, outcomes from existing trials with follow-up into childhood and adulthood are needed in order to investigate any longer-term effects of antenatal corticosteroids. We encourage authors of previous studies to provide further information which may answer any remaining questions about the use of antenatal corticosteroids without the need for further randomised controlled trials.

UNITE (NCT03419403) was a phase 3b, open-label, randomized, exploratory study performed at 18 research sites in 5 countries.\nMETHODS: The study enrolled adult patients with epidermal growth factor receptor-amplified, histologically confirmed, newly diagnosed supratentorial glioblastoma or grade IV gliosarcoma, and a Karnofsky Performance Status \u226570, receiving depatuxizumab mafodotin. All patients were administered depatuxizumab mafodotin during concurrent radiotherapy and temozolomide and with adjuvant temozolomide. Ninety patients were to be randomized (1:1:1) to OSE prophylactic treatments with each depatuxizumab mafodotin infusion: (a) standard steroid eye drops, (b) standard steroid eye drops plus vasoconstrictor eye drops and cold compress, or (c) enhanced steroids plus vasoconstrictor eye drops and cold compress. A Corneal Epitheliopathy Adverse Event (CEAE) scale was devised to capture symptoms, grade OSEs (scale of 0-5), and inform ADC dose modifications. The primary endpoint was the frequency of a required change in OSE management due to inadequate control of OSEs, defined as decline from baseline in visual acuity (using logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution [LogMAR] scale) or a Grade \u22653 CEAE event, in the worst eye in the first 8 weeks of treatment; unless otherwise specified, the treatment period refers to both the chemoradiation and adjuvant phases.\nRESULTS: The UNITE study was stopped early after interim analysis of separate phase III trial showed no difference in survival from depatuxizumab mafodotin. Forty patients were randomized (38 received depatuxizumab mafodotin). Overall, 23 patients experienced inadequate control of OSEs that required change in OSE management within 8 weeks of treatment, with 21 (70.0%) experiencing \u2265+0.3 change on LogMAR scale in baseline-adjusted visual acuity and 12 reporting a grade \u22653 CEAE. There were no definitive differences among prophylactic treatments.\nCONCLUSIONS: The premature cessation of the study precludes definitive conclusions regarding the OSE prophylaxis strategies. No new clinically significant safety findings were noted.

Pharmacotherapy of brain tumours can be limited by restricted drug delivery across the blood-brain or blood-tumour barrier, although data from phase II studies of the HER2-targeted ADC trastuzumab deruxtecan indicate clinically relevant intracranial activity in patients with brain metastases from HER2+ breast cancer. However, depatuxizumab mafodotin, an ADC targeting wild-type EGFR and EGFR variant III, did not provide a definitive overall survival benefit in patients with newly diagnosed or recurrent EGFR-amplified glioblastoma in phase II and III trials, despite objective radiological responses in some patients. In this Review, we summarize the available data on the central nervous system activity of ADCs from trials involving patients with primary and secondary brain tumours and discuss their clinical implications.

Understanding the mechanisms of failure for this promising strategy is critically important.\nMETHODS: PDX models were employed to study efficacy of systemic vs intracranial delivery of Depatux-M. Immunofluorescence and MALDI-MSI were performed to detect drug levels in the brain. EGFR levels and compensatory pathways were studied using quantitative flow cytometry, Western blots, RNAseq, FISH, and phosphoproteomics.\nRESULTS: Systemic delivery of Depatux-M was highly effective in nine of 10 EGFR-amplified heterotopic PDXs with survival extending beyond one year in eight PDXs. Acquired resistance in two PDXs (GBM12 and GBM46) was driven by suppression of EGFR expression or emergence of a novel short-variant of EGFR lacking the epitope for the Depatux-M antibody. In contrast to the profound benefit observed in heterotopic tumors, only two of seven intrinsically sensitive PDXs were responsive to Depatux-M as intracranial tumors. Poor efficacy in orthotopic PDXs was associated with limited and heterogeneous distribution of Depatux-M into tumor tissues, and artificial disruption of the BBB or bypass of the BBB by direct intracranial injection of Depatux-M into orthotopic tumors markedly enhanced the efficacy of drug treatment.\nCONCLUSIONS: Despite profound intrinsic sensitivity to Depatux-M, limited drug delivery into brain tumor may have been a key contributor to lack of efficacy in recently failed clinical trials.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33601293": "BACKGROUND: In the EORTC 1410/INTELLANCE 2 randomised, phase II study (NCT02343406), with the antibody-drug conjugate depatuxizumab mafodotin (Depatux-M, ABT-414) in patients with recurrent EGFR-amplified glioblastoma, the primary end-point (overall survival) was not met, and the drug had ocular dose-limiting toxicity.

In a large, observational, bevacizumab treatment study (Bevacizumab Regimens: Investigation of Treatment Effects and Safety [BRiTE]) in patients who had mCRC, a longer-than-expected overall survival (OS) of 25.1 months was reported. The association between various pre- and post-treatment factors (including the use of bevacizumab beyond first progression [BBP]) and survival was examined.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: The 1,445 of 1,953 previously untreated patients with mCRC who were enrolled in BRiTE and who experienced disease progression (PD) were classified into three groups: no post-PD treatment (n = 253), post-PD treatment without bevacizumab (no BBP; n = 531), and BBP (n = 642). Relevant baseline and on-study variables, including BBP, were analyzed with a Cox model with respect to their independent effect on survival beyond first PD.\nRESULTS: Median OS was 25.1 months (95% CI, 23.4 to 27.5 months), and median progression-free survival was 10.0 months in the overall BRiTE population.

Methods: We performed a consecutive retrospective analysis of patients with confirmed mCRC who were treated with bevacizumab at \"Prof Dr. Ion Chiricuta\" Institute of Oncology, Cluj-Napoca, Romania. We included patients who had received bevacizumab as first- or second-line therapy and further stratified them according to the dose administered as a second-line (either standard dose of 5\u00a0mg/kg every 2\u00a0weeks or 7.5\u00a0mg/kg every 3\u00a0weeks, or double dose of 10\u00a0mg/kg every 2\u00a0weeks or 15\u00a0mg/kg every 3\u00a0weeks-depending on the classical chemotherapy partner). All patients had received bevacizumab beyond progression (BYP) which is defined as continuing bevacizumab administration through second-line treatment despite disease progression. In each group, we evaluated the prognostic factors that influenced survival and treatment outcome. Results: One hundred and fifty-one (151) patients were included in the study.

The median overall survival in the DDB group was 41 months (range 27-49) compared to 25 months (range 23-29) in the SDB group (p = 0.01 log-rank test). First-line oxaliplatin-based treatment was used more frequently regardless of group, while irinotecan-based more frequently used as a second-line treatment (p = 0.014). Both oxaliplatin- and irinotecan-based regimens were found to be suitable partners for BYP. Statistical analysis revealed that dose intensity, primary tumor location, and cumulative exposure to BYP had significant influence on survival.

Older age (odds ratio [OR]: 1.04) and liver transplant candidates (OR: 1.71) were associated with seropositivity. Previous history of SOT (OR: 0.54) and pancreas/kidney transplant candidates (OR: 0.24) were associated with seronegativity. Among 394 MMRV seronegative patients, 60 patients received 1 dose of MMR vaccine and 14 patients received 1 dose of varicella-zoster virus vaccine without severe adverse events. A total of 35% (13/37) of patients who had follow-up serologies did not have a serological response.\nCONCLUSIONS: A significant number of pre-SOT candidates were not immune to at least 1 dose of MMRV. This highlights the importance of MMRV screening and vaccinations pre-SOT.

The primary outcome was survival with a favorable functional outcome at 6 months after injury, as assessed with the use of the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOS-E). Levels on the GOS-E range from 1 (death) to 8 (\"upper good recovery\" [no injury-related problems]). We defined survival with a favorable functional outcome as a GOS-E level of 5 (\"lower moderate disability\") or higher. Secondary outcomes included death from any cause within 28 days and within 6 months after injury.\nRESULTS: A total of 1310 patients were recruited by 15 emergency medical services in Australia, New Zealand, and Germany. Of these patients, 661 were assigned to receive tranexamic acid, and 646 were assigned to receive placebo; the trial-group assignment was unknown for 3 patients. Survival with a favorable functional outcome at 6 months occurred in 307 of 572 patients (53.7%) in the tranexamic acid group and in 299 of 559 (53.5%) in the placebo group (risk ratio, 1.00; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.90 to 1.12; P\u2009=\u20090.95). At 28 days after injury, 113 of 653 patients (17.3%) in the tranexamic acid group and 139 of 637 (21.8%) in the placebo group had died (risk ratio, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.63 to 0.99). By 6 months, 123 of 648 patients (19.0%) in the tranexamic acid group and 144 of 629 (22.9%) in the placebo group had died (risk ratio, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.67 to 1.03). The number of serious adverse events, including vascular occlusive events, did not differ meaningfully between the groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: Among adults with major trauma and suspected trauma-induced coagulopathy who were being treated in advanced trauma systems, prehospital administration of tranexamic acid followed by an infusion over 8 hours did not result in a greater number of patients surviving with a favorable functional outcome at 6 months than placebo.

Tranexamic acid (TXA), administered soon after hospital arrival in certain trauma systems, is an effective therapy in preventing or managing acute traumatic coagulopathy. However, delayed administration of TXA appears to be ineffective or harmful. The effectiveness of prehospital TXA, incidence of thrombotic complications, benefit versus risk in advanced trauma systems and the mechanism of benefit remain uncertain.\nMETHODS AND ANALYSIS: The Pre-hospital Anti-fibrinolytics for Traumatic Coagulopathy and Haemorrhage (The PATCH-Trauma study) is comparing TXA, initiated prehospital and continued in hospital over 8\u2009hours, with placebo in patients with severe trauma at risk of acute traumatic coagulopathy.

This study was undertaken to evaluate the toxicity and efficacy of oral capecitabine when used with preoperative radiation therapy.\nMETHODS AND MATERIALS: We conducted a prospective Phase II trial to assess the pathologic response, sphincter preservation effect, and acute toxicity of preoperative chemoradiation (CRT) in locally advanced (uT3-4/N +) but resectable adenocarcinoma of the lower two-thirds of the rectum. The radiation dose was 50 Gy over 5 weeks (46 Gy to whole pelvis + 4 Gy boost), and capecitabine was administered daily at a dose of 1650 mg/m(2) during the entire course of radiation therapy. Surgery was performed with standardized total mesorectal excision 4 to 6 weeks after completion of CRT and followed by four cycles of capecitabine (2500 mg/m(2)/day for 14 days).\nRESULTS: Ninety-five patients were entered into this study; their median age was 55 (range, 31-75 years). Ninety (95%) patients completed preoperative CRT as planned, and complete resection was achieved in 92 of 94 resected cases (98%). Downstaging rate was 71% (56/79) on endorectal ultrasonography, and it was 76% (71/94) on pathology finding. No tumor cell was observed in the specimens of 11 patients (12%).

Capecitabine was administered orally at a dose of 825 mg/m(2) twice-daily concomitantly every day during pelvic irradiation. The planned total dose of radiotherapy was 50.4 Gy, given with daily fractions of 1.8Gy, 5 days a week, over a period of about 5.5 weeks. Large pelvic dose (PTV-1) was 45.0 Gy/25 fractions in 5 weeks. Higher dose up to 50.4 Gy in further 3 fractions was given using boost fields (PTV-2). Radiotherapy was performed with high-energy photon beam (18 MV) linear accelerator using 3-dimensional (3D) treatment planning for 3 or 4 fields technique.\nRESULTS: Toxicity was low: grade (G) 3 local dermatitis in 2 (6%), G3 diarrhea in 3 (9%) and G3 leucopenia in 1 (3%) patients. However, 2(6%) patients required drug dose reduction by 80%.

MS affects an estimated 900\u202f000 people in the US. MS typically presents in young adults (mean age of onset, 20-30 years) and can lead to physical disability, cognitive impairment, and decreased quality of life. This review summarizes current evidence regarding diagnosis and treatment of MS.\nOBSERVATIONS: MS typically presents in young adults aged 20 to 30 years with unilateral optic neuritis, partial myelitis, sensory disturbances, or brainstem syndromes such as internuclear ophthalmoplegia developing over several days. The prevalence of MS worldwide ranges from 5 to 300 per 100\u202f000 people and increases at higher latitudes. Overall life expectancy is less than in the general population (75.9 vs 83.4 years), and MS more commonly affects women (female to male sex distribution of nearly 3:1). Diagnosis is made based on a combination of signs and symptoms, radiographic findings (eg, magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] T2 lesions), and laboratory findings (eg, cerebrospinal fluid-specific oligoclonal bands), which are components of the 2017 McDonald Criteria. Nine classes of disease-modifying therapies (DMTs), with varying mechanisms of action and routes of administration, are available for relapsing-remitting MS, defined as relapses at onset with stable neurologic disability between episodes, and secondary progressive MS with activity, defined as steadily increasing neurologic disability following a relapsing course with evidence of ongoing inflammatory activity. These drugs include interferons, glatiramer acetate, teriflunomide, sphingosine 1-phosphate receptor modulators, fumarates, cladribine, and 3 types of monoclonal antibodies. One additional DMT, ocrelizumab, is approved for primary progressive MS. These DMTs reduce clinical relapses and MRI lesions (new T2 lesions, gadolinium-enhancing lesions). Efficacy rates of current DMTs, defined by reduction in annualized relapse rates compared with placebo or active comparators, range from 29%-68%. Adverse effects include infections, bradycardia, heart blocks, macular edema, infusion reactions, injection-site reactions, and secondary autoimmune adverse effects, such as autoimmune thyroid disease.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: MS is characterized by physical disability, cognitive impairment, and other symptoms that affect quality of life.

The most common adverse events were headache and alterations in liver-enzyme levels. Alanine aminotransferase increased to levels above the upper limit of the normal range in four patients, a finding potentially related to an immune response against the infused vector; these patients were treated with a course of glucocorticoids.

Transcriptome, associated KEGG, and Gene Ontology analyses unveiled the activation of distinct inflammatory pathways, such as cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, MAPK signaling, and NF\u03baB activation. Furthermore, the mRNA expression and secretome analysis confirmed an upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-8 upon BF stimulation.

FP present a narrow therapeutic index with 10 to 26% of patients experiencing acute severe or life-threatening toxicity. With the high number of patients receiving FP-based therapies, and the significant effects of toxicities on their quality of life, the prevention of FP-related adverse events is of major clinical interest. Host genetic variants in the rate limiting enzyme dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPYD) gene are related to the occurrence of extremely severe, early onset toxicity in FP treated patients. The pre-treatment diagnostic test of 4 DPYD genetic polymorphisms is suggested by the currently available pharmacogenetic guidelines. Several prospective implementation projects are ongoing to support the introduction of up-front genotyping of the patients in clinical practice. Multiple pharmacogenetic studies tried to assess the predictive role of other polymorphisms in genes involved in the FP pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamic pathways, TYMS and MTHFR, but no additional clinically validated genetic markers of toxicity are available to date. The development of next-generation sequencing platforms opens new possibilities to highlight previously unreported genetic markers. Moreover, the investigation of the genetic variation in the patients immunological system, a pivotal target in cancer treatment, could bring notable advances in the field.

We assessed the effect of prospective screening for the four most relevant DPYD variants (DPYD*2A [rs3918290, c.1905+1G>A, IVS14+1G>A], c.2846A>T [rs67376798, D949V], c.1679T>G [rs55886062, DPYD*13, I560S], and c.1236G>A [rs56038477, E412E, in haplotype B3]) on patient safety and subsequent DPYD genotype-guided dose individualisation in daily clinical care.\nMETHODS: In this prospective, multicentre, safety analysis in 17 hospitals in the Netherlands, the study population consisted of adult patients (\u226518 years) with cancer who were intended to start on a fluoropyrimidine-based anticancer therapy (capecitabine or fluorouracil as single agent or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents or radiotherapy). Patients with all tumour types for which fluoropyrimidine-based therapy was considered in their best interest were eligible. We did prospective genotyping for DPYD*2A, c.2846A>T, c.1679T>G, and c.1236G>A. Heterozygous DPYD variant allele carriers received an initial dose reduction of 25% (c.2846A>T and c.1236G>A) or 50% (DPYD*2A and c.1679T>G), and DPYD wild-type patients were treated according to the current standard of care. The primary endpoint of the study was the frequency of severe (National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03 grade \u22653) overall fluoropyrimidine-related toxicity across the entire treatment duration. We compared toxicity incidence between DPYD variant allele carriers and DPYD wild-type patients on an intention-to-treat basis, and relative risks (RRs) for severe toxicity were compared between the current study and a historical cohort of DPYD variant allele carriers treated with full dose fluoropyrimidine-based therapy (derived from a previously published meta-analysis). This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02324452, and is complete.\nFINDINGS: Between April 30, 2015, and Dec 21, 2017, we enrolled 1181 patients. 78 patients were considered non-evaluable, because they were retrospectively identified as not meeting inclusion criteria, did not start fluoropyrimidine-based treatment, or were homozygous or compound heterozygous DPYD variant allele carriers. Of 1103 evaluable patients, 85 (8%) were heterozygous DPYD variant allele carriers, and 1018 (92%) were DPYD wild-type patients. Overall, fluoropyrimidine-related severe toxicity was higher in DPYD variant carriers (33 [39%] of 85 patients) than in wild-type patients (231 [23%] of 1018 patients; p=0\u00b70013). The RR for severe fluoropyrimidine-related toxicity was 1\u00b731 (95% CI 0\u00b763-2\u00b773) for genotype-guided dosing compared with 2\u00b787 (2\u00b714-3\u00b786) in the historical cohort for DPYD*2A carriers, no toxicity compared with 4\u00b730 (2\u00b710-8\u00b780) in c.1679T>G carriers, 2\u00b700 (1\u00b719-3\u00b734) compared with 3\u00b711 (2\u00b725-4\u00b728) for c.2846A>T carriers, and 1\u00b769 (1\u00b718-2\u00b742) compared with 1\u00b772 (1\u00b722-2\u00b742) for c.1236G>A carriers.\nINTERPRETATION: Prospective DPYD genotyping was feasible in routine clinical practice, and DPYD genotype-based dose reductions improved patient safety of fluoropyrimidine treatment. For DPYD*2A and c.1679T>G carriers, a 50% initial dose reduction was adequate. For c.1236G>A and c.2846A>T carriers, a larger dose reduction of 50% (instead of 25%) requires investigation.

However, fluoropyrimidine-driven toxicities are a major problem in the management of the disease. The grade and type of the toxicities depend on demographic factors, but substantial inter-individual variation in fluoropyrimidine-related toxicity is partly explained by genetic factors. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPYD), thymidylate synthase (TYMS), and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) polymorphisms in colorectal cancer patients. Eighty-five patients who were administered fluoropyrimidine-based treatment were included in the study. The DPYD, TYMS and MTHFR polymorphisms were scanned by a next generation Sequenom MassARRAY. Fluoropyrimidine toxicities were observed in 92% of all patients. The following polymorphisms were detected: DPYD 85T&gt;C (29.4% heterozygote mutants, 7.1% homozygote mutants), DPYD IVS 14+1G&gt;A (1.2% heterozygote mutants), TYMS 1494del TTAAAG (38.4% heterozygote mutants, 24.7% homozygote mutants), MTHFR 677C&gt;T (43.5% heterozygote mutants, 9.4% homozygote mutants) and MTHFR 1298A&gt;C (8.2% heterozygote mutants, 2.4% homozygote mutants). A statistically significant association was demonstrated between MTHFR 677C&gt;T and fluoropyrimidine-related toxicity. Furthermore, MTHFR 1298A&gt;C was associated with hematopoietic toxicity.

For decades, fluorouracil has been the main anticancer drug for the treatment of colorectal cancer. Recently, however, new agents have been introduced: raltitrexed, irinotecan and oxaliplatin. Currently, the dosage for an individual patient is calculated from the estimated body surface area of the patient. Toxicity, however, frequently necessitates decreasing the dosage, extending the dose interval or even discontinuing treatment. Risk factors with predictive value for toxicity have been identified in several studies. These risk factors are often determined by the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the drug. In this review, the risk factors for toxicity of the cytotoxic agents used in the treatment of advanced colorectal cancer are considered. For fluorouracil, age, gender, performance status, genetic polymorphism of dihydropyridine dehydrogenase, drug administration schedule, circadian rhythm of plasma concentrations, history of previous chemotherapy-related diarrhoea, xerostomia, low neutrophil levels, and drug-drug interactions have been identified as affecting chemotherapeutic toxicity. For raltitrexed, gender and renal and hepatic impairment, and for oxaliplatin, renal impairment and circadian rhythm of plasma concentrations, respectively, can be considered as risk factors for toxicity. In addition, age, performance status, bilirubinaemia, genetic polymorphism of uridine 5'-diphosphate-glucuronyltransferase-1A1 and drug administration schedule have been shown to be related to irinotecan toxicity. The available literature suggests that dose adjustment based on these risk factors can be used to individualise the dose in order to decrease toxicity and to improve the therapeutic index. This also applies to therapeutic drug monitoring, which has been shown to be effective controlling the toxicity of fluorouracil in some studies. Future research is warranted to assess the potential advantage of dose individualisation of chemotherapy founded on risk factors, over direct dose calculation from the estimated body surface area, with regard to toxicity, therapeutic index, and quality of life, in patients with advanced colorectal cancer.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37569281": "Elevated excitability of glutamatergic neurons in the lateral parabrachial nucleus (PBL) is associated with the pathogenesis of inflammatory pain, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. Sodium leak channel (NALCN) is widely expressed in the central nervous system and regulates neuronal excitability. In this study, chemogenetic manipulation was used to explore the association between the activity of PBL glutamatergic neurons and pain thresholds. Complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) was used to construct an inflammatory pain model in mice. Pain behaviour was tested using von Frey filaments and Hargreaves tests. Local field potential (LFP) was used to record the activity of PBL glutamatergic neurons. Gene knockdown techniques were used to investigate the role of NALCN in inflammatory pain. We further explored the downstream projections of PBL using cis-trans-synaptic tracer virus. The results showed that chemogenetic inhibition of PBL glutamatergic neurons increased pain thresholds in mice, whereas chemogenetic activation produced the opposite results. CFA plantar modelling increased the number of C-Fos protein and NALCN expression in PBL glutamatergic neurons. Knockdown of NALCN in PBL glutamatergic neurons alleviated CFA-induced pain. CFA injection induced C-Fos protein expression in central nucleus amygdala (CeA) neurons, which was suppressed by NALCN knockdown in PBL glutamatergic neurons. Therefore, elevated expression of NALCN in PBL glutamatergic neurons contributes to the development of inflammatory pain via PBL-CeA projections.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37640554": "We tested the role of the sodium leak channel, NALCN, in pacemaking of dopaminergic neuron (DAN) subpopulations from adult male and female mice. In situ hybridization revealed NALCN RNA in all DANs, with lower abundance in medial ventral tegmental area (VTA) relative to substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). Despite lower relative abundance of NALCN, we found that acute pharmacological blockade of NALCN in medial VTA DANs slowed pacemaking by 49.08%. We also examined the electrophysiological properties of projection-defined VTA DAN subpopulations identified by retrograde labeling. Inhibition of NALCN reduced pacemaking in DANs projecting to medial nucleus accumbens (NAc) and others projecting to lateral NAc by 70.74% and 31.98%, respectively, suggesting that NALCN is a primary driver of pacemaking in VTA DANs. In SNc DANs, potentiating NALCN by lowering extracellular calcium concentration speeded pacemaking in wildtype but not NALCN conditional knockout mice, demonstrating functional presence of NALCN. In contrast to VTA DANs, however, pacemaking in SNc DANs was unaffected by inhibition of NALCN. Instead, we found that inhibition of NALCN increased the gain of frequency-current plots at firing frequencies slower than spontaneous firing. Similarly, inhibition of the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) conductance increased gain but had little effect on pacemaking. Interestingly, simultaneous inhibition of NALCN and HCN resulted in significant reduction in pacemaker rate. Thus, we found NALCN makes substantial contributions to driving pacemaking in VTA DAN subpopulations. In SNc DANs, NALCN is not critical for pacemaking but inhibition of NALCN makes cells more sensitive to hyperpolarizing stimuli.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Pacemaking in midbrain dopaminergic neurons (DAN) relies on multiple subthreshold conductances, including a sodium leak. Whether the sodium leak channel, NALCN, contributes to pacemaking in DANs located in the VTA and the SNc has not yet been determined. Using electrophysiology and pharmacology, we show that NALCN plays a prominent role in driving pacemaking in projection-defined VTA DAN subpopulations. By contrast, pacemaking in SNc neurons does not rely on NALCN. Instead, the presence of NALCN regulates the excitability of SNc DANs by reducing the gain of the neuron's response to inhibitory stimuli. Together, these findings will inform future efforts to obtain DAN subpopulation-specific treatments for use in neuropsychiatric disorders.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35911839": "BACKGROUND: The NALCN encodes a sodium ion leak channel that regulates nerve-resting conductance and excitability.

NALCN and FAM155A form the core complex of the channel, the activity of which essentially depends on the presence of both UNC79 and UNC80, two auxiliary proteins. NALCN, FAM155A, UNC79, and UNC80 co-assemble into a large hetero-tetrameric channel complex. Genetic mutations of NALCN channel components lead to neurodevelopmental diseases. However, the structure and mechanism of the intact channel complex remain elusive. Here, we present the cryo-EM structure of the mammalian NALCN-FAM155A-UNC79-UNC80 quaternary complex. The structure shows that UNC79-UNC80 form a large piler-shaped heterodimer which was tethered to the intracellular side of the NALCN channel through tripartite interactions with the cytoplasmic loops of NALCN. Two interactions are essential for proper cell surface localization of NALCN. The other interaction relieves the self-inhibition of NALCN by pulling the auto-inhibitory CTD Interacting Helix (CIH) out of its binding site. Our work defines the structural mechanism of NALCN modulation by UNC79 and UNC80.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36175792": "We identify the sodium leak channel non-selective protein (NALCN) as a key regulator of cancer metastasis and nonmalignant cell dissemination.

Deletion of Nalcn from gastric, intestinal or pancreatic adenocarcinomas in mice did not alter tumor incidence, but markedly increased the number of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and metastases. Treatment of these mice with gadolinium-a NALCN channel blocker-similarly increased CTCs and metastases. Deletion of Nalcn from mice that lacked oncogenic mutations and never developed cancer caused shedding of epithelial cells into the blood at levels equivalent to those seen in tumor-bearing animals. These cells trafficked to distant organs to form normal structures including lung epithelium, and kidney glomeruli and tubules. Thus, NALCN regulates cell shedding from solid tissues independent of cancer, divorcing this process from tumorigenesis and unmasking a potential new target for antimetastatic therapies.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36757703": "IMPORTANCE: Transgender and gender-diverse individuals face unique challenges, including barriers to health care access and inequities in treatment, that may influence cancer risk and outcomes.\nOBSERVATIONS: In this narrative review, a scoping review was conducted focusing on primary and secondary prevention and epidemiology of cancer, barriers to health care services, and health care practitioners' knowledge about specific issues pertaining to transgender and gender-diverse individuals. PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and Embase, were reviewed for citations from their inception to December 31, 2021. This review revealed that transgender and gender-diverse people had a high prevalence of tobacco consumption and alcohol use and high rates of infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) and HIV. Transgender and gender-diverse individuals were less likely to adhere to cancer screening programs and had a higher incidence of HIV- and HPV-associated cancers. Social and economic determinants seemed to drive these disparities in risk factors and outcomes. A lack of knowledge about gender minorities' health needs among health care practitioners was evidenced, and it represented a major hurdle to cancer prevention, care, and survivorship for transgender and gender-diverse individuals. Discrimination, discomfort caused by gender-labeled oncological services, stigma, and lack of cultural sensitivity of health care practitioners were other barriers met by transgender and gender-diverse persons in the oncology setting.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings suggest that transgender and gender-diverse peoples' needs in the cancer care continuum are not optimally addressed.

Multivariable Cox regression models were fit to estimate relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs).\nRESULTS: Ever-smokers were at moderately increased risk for incident colorectal cancer (RR = 1.19, 95% CI = 1.05 to 1.35) compared with never-smokers. Higher risk estimates were observed for current smokers with MSI-high tumors (RR = 1.99, 95% CI = 1.26 to 3.14), CIMP-positive tumors (RR = 1.88, 95% CI = 1.22 to 2.90), and BRAF mutation-positive tumors (RR = 1.92, 95% CI = 1.22 to 3.02). Other smoking-related variables (ie, age at initiation, total duration, average number of cigarettes smoked per day, cumulative pack-years, and induction period) were also associated with MSI-high, CIMP-positive, and BRAF mutation-positive tumor subtypes. Conversely, cigarette smoking status (ever vs never) was not associated with the MSI-low or microsatellite stable (RR = 1.00, 95% CI = 0.79 to 1.25), CIMP-negative (RR = 1.02, 95% CI = 0.81 to 1.30), or BRAF mutation-negative subtypes (RR = 1.00, 95% CI = 0.65 to 1.27).\nCONCLUSIONS: In this prospective study of older women, cigarette smoking was associated with the MSI-high, CIMP-positive, and BRAF mutation-positive colorectal cancer subtypes, which indicates that epigenetic modification may be functionally involved in smoking-related colorectal carcinogenesis.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34377935": "BACKGROUND: Smoking is associated with colorectal cancer (CRC) risk. Previous studies suggested this association may be restricted to certain molecular subtypes of CRC, but large-scale comprehensive analysis is lacking.\nMETHODS: A total of 9789 CRC cases and 11 231 controls of European ancestry from 11 observational studies were included. We harmonized smoking variables across studies and derived sex study-specific quartiles of pack-years of smoking for analysis. Four somatic colorectal tumor markers were assessed individually and in combination, including BRAF mutation, KRAS mutation, CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP), and microsatellite instability (MSI) status. A multinomial logistic regression analysis was used to assess the association between smoking and risk of CRC subtypes by molecular characteristics, adjusting for age, sex, and study. All statistical tests were 2-sided and adjusted for Bonferroni correction.\nRESULTS: Heavier smoking was associated with higher risk of CRC overall and stratified by individual markers (P <sub>trend</sub> &lt; .001). The associations differed statistically significantly between all molecular subtypes, which was the most statistically significant for CIMP and BRAF. Compared with never-smokers, smokers in the fourth quartile of pack-years had a 90% higher risk of CIMP-positive CRC (odds ratio\u2009=\u20091.90, 95% confidence interval = 1.60 to 2.26) but only 35% higher risk for CIMP-negative CRC (odds ratio\u2009=\u20091.35, 95% confidence interval = 1.22 to 1.49; P <sub>difference</sub> = 2.1 x 10-6). The association was also stronger in tumors that were CIMP positive, MSI high, or KRAS wild type when combined (P <sub>difference</sub> &lt; .001).\nCONCLUSION: Smoking was associated with differential risk of CRC subtypes defined by molecular characteristics. Heavier smokers had particularly higher risk of CRC subtypes that were CIMP positive and MSI high in combination, suggesting that smoking may be involved in the development of colorectal tumors via the serrated pathway.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32773458": "INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to provide the most comprehensive and up-to-date evidence on the association between cigarette smoking and colorectal cancer (CRC) risk.\nMETHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of epidemiological studies on the association between cigarette smoking and CRC risk published up to September 2018. We calculated relative risk (RR) of CRC according to smoking status, intensity, duration, pack-years, and time since quitting, with a focus on molecular subtypes of CRC.\nRESULTS: The meta-analysis summarizes the evidence from 188 original studies. Compared with never smokers, the pooled RR for CRC was 1.14 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.10-1.18) for current smokers and 1.17 (95% CI 1.15-1.20) for former smokers. CRC risk increased linearly with smoking intensity and duration. Former smokers who had quit smoking for more than 25 years had significantly decreased risk of CRC compared with current smokers. Smoking was strongly associated with the risk of CRC, characterized by high CpG island methylator phenotype (RR 1.42; 95% CI 1.20-1.67; number of studies [n] = 4), BRAF mutation (RR 1.63; 95% CI 1.23-2.16; n = 4), or high microsatellite instability (RR 1.56; 95% CI 1.32-1.85; n = 8), but not characterized by KRAS (RR 1.04; 95% CI 0.90-1.20; n = 5) or TP53 (RR 1.13; 95% CI 0.99-1.29; n = 5) mutations.\nDISCUSSION: Cigarette smoking increases the risk of CRC in a dose-dependent manner with intensity and duration, and quitting smoking reduces CRC risk. Smoking greatly increases the risk of CRC that develops through the microsatellite instability pathway, characterized by microsatellite instability-high, CpG island methylator phenotype positive, and BRAF mutation.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34548904": "Tobacco smoke and red/processed meats are well-known risk factors for colorectal cancer (CRC). Most research has focused on studies of normal colon biopsies in epidemiologic studies or treatment of CRC cell lines in vitro. These studies are often constrained by challenges with accuracy of self-report data or, in the case of CRC cell lines, small sample sizes and lack of relationship to normal tissue at risk. In an attempt to address some of these limitations, we performed a 24-hour treatment of a representative carcinogens cocktail in 37 independent organoid lines derived from normal colon biopsies. Machine learning algorithms were applied to bulk RNA-sequencing and revealed cellular composition changes in colon organoids. We identified 738 differentially expressed genes in response to carcinogens exposure. Network analysis identified significantly different modules of co-expression, that included genes related to MSI-H tumor biology, and genes previously implicated in CRC through genome-wide association studies. Our study helps to better define the molecular effects of representative carcinogens from smoking and red/processed meat in normal colon epithelial cells and in the etiology of the MSI-H subtype of CRC, and suggests an overlap between molecular mechanisms involved in inherited and environmental CRC risk.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25280443": "BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a heterogeneous disease that can develop via several pathways. Different CRC subtypes, identified based on tumor markers, have been proposed to reflect these pathways. We evaluated the significance of these previously proposed classifications to survival.\nMETHODS: Participants in the population-based Seattle Colon Cancer Family Registry were diagnosed with invasive CRC from 1998 through 2007 in western Washington State (N = 2706), and followed for survival through 2012. Tumor samples were collected from 2050 participants and classified into 5 subtypes based on combinations of tumor markers: type 1 (microsatellite instability [MSI]-high, CpG island methylator phenotype [CIMP] -positive, positive for BRAF mutation, negative for KRAS mutation); type 2 (microsatellite stable [MSS] or MSI-low, CIMP-positive, positive for BRAF mutation, negative for KRAS mutation); type 3 (MSS or MSI low, non-CIMP, negative for BRAF mutation, positive for KRAS mutation); type 4 (MSS or MSI-low, non-CIMP, negative for mutations in BRAF and KRAS); and type 5 (MSI-high, non-CIMP, negative for mutations in BRAF and KRAS). Multiple imputation was used to impute tumor markers for those missing data on 1-3 markers. We used Cox regression to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for associations of subtypes with disease-specific and overall mortality, adjusting for age, sex, body mass, diagnosis year, and smoking history.\nRESULTS: Compared with participants with type 4 tumors (the most predominant), participants with type 2 tumors had the highest disease-specific mortality (HR = 2.20, 95% CI: 1.47-3.31); subjects with type 3 tumors also had higher disease-specific mortality (HR = 1.32, 95% CI: 1.07-1.63). Subjects with type 5 tumors had the lowest disease-specific mortality (HR = 0.30, 95% CI: 0.14-0.66). Associations with overall mortality were similar to those with disease-specific mortality.\nCONCLUSIONS: Based on a large, population-based study, CRC subtypes, defined by proposed etiologic pathways, are associated with marked differences in survival.

However, there is currently no treatment available for intracerebral hemorrhage, unlike for other stroke subtypes. Recent studies have indicated that mitochondrial dysfunction and mitophagy likely relate to the pathophysiology of intracerebral hemorrhage. Mitophagy, or selective autophagy of mitochondria, is an essential pathway to preserve mitochondrial homeostasis by clearing up damaged mitochondria. Mitophagy markedly contributes to the reduction of secondary brain injury caused by mitochondrial dysfunction after intracerebral hemorrhage. This review provides an overview of the mitochondrial dysfunction that occurs after intracerebral hemorrhage and the underlying mechanisms regarding how mitophagy regulates it, and discusses the new direction of therapeutic strategies targeting mitophagy for intracerebral hemorrhage, aiming to determine the close connection between mitophagy and intracerebral hemorrhage and identify new therapies to modulate mitophagy after intracerebral hemorrhage. In conclusion, although only a small number of drugs modulating mitophagy in intracerebral hemorrhage have been found thus far, most of which are in the preclinical stage and require further investigation, mitophagy is still a very valid and promising therapeutic target for intracerebral hemorrhage in the long run.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37549565": "Mitophagy is an essential physiological process that eliminates damaged mitochondria via lysosomes. It is reported that hypoxia, inflammatory stimuli or other stress conditions could lead to mitochondrial damage and mitochondrial dysfunction, which induces the process of mitophagy. Herein, we report a novel fluorescent probe PC-NTR for imaging hypoxia-induced mitophagy by monitoring the change of nitroreductase and viscosity simultaneously. To our delight, PC-NTR could respond simultaneously to nitroreductase and viscosity at different fluorescence channels with no mutual interference under the same excitation wavelength. The fluorescence emission around 535\u00a0nm was enhanced dramatically after addition of nitroreductase while the fluorescence emission around 635\u00a0nm heightened as the viscosity increased. The probe would be able to selectively targeting of mitochondria in cells because of the positively charged pyridine salt structure of PC-NTR. The probe was successfully applied to assess the different levels of hypoxia and real-time imaging of mitochondrial autophagy in live cells. More importantly, using dual channel imaging, PC-NTR could be used to distinguish cancer cells from normal cells and was successfully applied to imaging experiments in HeLa-derived tumor-bearing nude mice. Therefore, PC-NTR would be an important molecular tool for hypoxia imaging and detecting solid tumors in vivo.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37862201": "Mitochondria are critical cellular energy resources and are central to the life of the neuron. Mitophagy selectively clears damaged or dysfunctional mitochondria through autophagic machinery to maintain mitochondrial quality control and homeostasis. Mature neurons are postmitotic and consume substantial energy, thus require highly efficient mitophagy pathways to turn over damaged or dysfunctional mitochondria. Recent evidence indicates that mitophagy is pivotal to the pathogenesis of neurological diseases. However, more work is needed to study mitophagy pathway components as potential therapeutic targets. In this review, we briefly discuss the characteristics of nonselective autophagy and selective autophagy, including ERphagy, aggrephagy, and mitophagy. We then introduce the mechanisms of Parkin-dependent and Parkin-independent mitophagy pathways under physiological conditions. Next, we summarize the diverse repertoire of mitochondrial membrane receptors and phospholipids that mediate mitophagy. Importantly, we review the critical role of mitophagy in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Last, we discuss recent studies considering mitophagy as a potential therapeutic target for treating neurodegenerative diseases.

Mitochondria are the key cellular organelles and produce most of the energy in the form of ATP, required for all the crucial functions of neurons. Hence, the regulation of mitochondrial biogenesis and quality control is important for maintaining neuronal health. As a part of mitochondrial quality control, the aged and damaged mitochondria are removed through a selective mode of autophagy called mitophagy. However, in different pathological conditions, this process is impaired in neuronal cells and lead to a variety of neurodegenerative disease (NDD). Various studies indicate that specific protein aggregates, the characteristics of different NDDs, affect this process of mitophagy, adding to the severity and progression of diseases. Though, the detailed process of this association is yet to be explored. In light of the significant role of impaired mitophagy in NDDs, further studies have also investigated a large number of therapeutic strategies to target mitophagy in these diseases. Our current review summarizes the abnormalities in different mitophagy pathways and their association with different NDDs. We have also elaborated upon various novel therapeutic strategies and their limitations to enhance mitophagy in NDDs that may help in the management of symptoms and increasing the life expectancy of NDD patients. Thus, our study provides an overview of mitophagy in NDDs and emphasizes the need to elucidate the mechanism of impaired mitophagy prevalent across different NDDs in future research.

Parkin-mediated protein ubiquitinations may be counteracted by deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs). We conducted a high-content imaging screen of Parkin translocation to depolarized mitochondria after siRNA mediated silencing of each DUB in Parkin overexpressing HeLa cells. Knockdown of the ubiquitin-specific protease USP36 led to delayed Parkin translocation while only slightly disturbing the ubiquitination of mitochondrial proteins, but final autophagic elimination of mitochondria was severely disrupted. The localization of the nucleolar USP36 was not altered during mitophagy. However, the marker for transcriptional active chromatin, histone 2B Lys120 mono-ubiquitination was found reduced in USP36-silenced cells undergoing mitophagy. We observed a reduction of the mRNA and protein levels of Beclin-1 and its associated autophagy-related key regulator ATG14L in USP36 knockdown cells. Importantly, transfection of active ATG14L into USP36-silenced cells significantly restored Parkin-dependent mitophagy.

Recently, the PCSK9Is (proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin 9 inhibitors) have become available as a potent lipid-lowering class with potentially less hemorrhagic propensity.\nMETHODS: We performed a systematic comparative meta-analysis assessing HS rates across all completed statin and PCSK9I randomized clinical trials with treatment >3 months, following PRISMA guidelines. In addition to HS rates across all trials, causal relation was probed by evaluating for dose-response relationships by medication (low versus high medication dose/potency) and by presence and type of preceding brain vascular events at inception (none versus ischemic stroke/transient ischemic attack versus HS).\nRESULTS: The systematic review identified 36 statin randomized clinical trials (204\u2009918 patients) and 5 PCSK9I randomized clinical trials (76\u2009140 patients). Across all patient types and all medication doses/potencies, statins were associated with increased HS: relative risk 1.15, P=0.04; PCSK9Is were not (P=0.77). In the medication dose/potency analysis, higher dose/potency statins (7 trials, 62\u2009204 patients) were associated with magnified HS risk: relative risk, 1.53; P=0.002; higher dose/potency PCSK9Is (1 trial, 27\u2009564 patients) were not (P=0.99). In the type of index brain vascular injury analysis for statins (5 trials, 9772 patients), prior ischemic stroke/transient ischemic attack was associated with a magnified risk of HS: relative risk, 1.43; P=0.04; and index intracerebral hemorrhage was associated with an extremely high effect estimate of risk of recurrent HS: hazard ratio, 4.06. For PCSK9Is, prior ischemic stroke/transient ischemic attack (1 trial, 5337 patients) was not associated with increased HS risk (P=0.97).\nCONCLUSIONS: Statins increase the risk of HS in a medication dose- and type of index brain vascular injury-dependent manner; PCSK9Is do not increase HS risk.

In the abdominoplasty trial, participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive one of the following over a 48-hour period: a 100-mg oral loading dose of VX-548, followed by a 50-mg maintenance dose every 12 hours (the high-dose group); a 60-mg loading dose of VX-548, followed by a 30-mg maintenance dose every 12 hours (the middle-dose group); hydrocodone bitartrate-acetaminophen (5 mg of hydrocodone bitartrate and 325 mg of acetaminophen every 6 hours); or oral placebo every 6 hours. In the bunionectomy trial, participants were randomly assigned in a 2:2:1:2:2 ratio to receive one of the following over a 48-hour treatment period: oral high-dose VX-548; middle-dose VX-548; low-dose VX-548 (a 20-mg loading dose, followed by a 10-mg maintenance dose every 12 hours); oral hydrocodone bitartrate-acetaminophen (5 mg of hydrocodone bitartrate and 325 mg of acetaminophen every 6 hours); or oral placebo every 6 hours. The primary end point was the time-weighted sum of the pain-intensity difference (SPID) over the 48-hour period (SPID48), a measure derived from the score on the Numeric Pain Rating Scale (range, 0 to 10; higher scores indicate greater pain) at 19 time points after the first dose of VX-548 or placebo. The main analysis compared each dose of VX-548 with placebo.\nRESULTS: A total of 303 participants were enrolled in the abdominoplasty trial and 274 in the bunionectomy trial. The least-squares mean difference between the high-dose VX-548 and placebo groups in the time-weighted SPID48 was 37.8 (95% confidence interval [CI], 9.2 to 66.4) after abdominoplasty and 36.8 (95% CI, 4.6 to 69.0) after bunionectomy. In both trials, participants who received lower doses of VX-548 had results similar to those with placebo. Headache and constipation were common adverse events with VX-548.\nCONCLUSIONS: As compared with placebo, VX-548 at the highest dose, but not at lower doses, reduced acute pain over a period of 48 hours after abdominoplasty or bunionectomy.

The pathogenesis of acute as well as chronic OIPN is still not completely known, and this is a limitation in the identification of effective strategies to prevent or limit their occurrence. Despite intense investigation at the preclinical and clinical levels, no treatment can be suggested for the prevention of OIPN, and only limited evidence for the efficacy of duloxetine in the treatment setting has been provided. In this review, ongoing neuroprotection clinical trials in oxaliplatin-treated patients will be analyzed with particular attention paid to the hypothesis leading to the study, to the trial strengths and weaknesses, and to the outcome measures proposed to test the efficacy of the therapeutic approach. It can be concluded that 1) prevention and treatment of OIPN still remains an important and unmet clinical need, 2) further, high-quality research is mandatory in order to achieve reliable and effective results, and 3) dose and schedule modification of OHP-based chemotherapy is currently the most effective approach to limit the severity of OIPN.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34880120": "Duloxetine, a serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, is the best-established treatment for painful chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN). While it is only effective in little more than half of patients, our ability to predict patient response remains incompletely understood. Given that stress exacerbates CIPN, and that the therapeutic effect of duloxetine is thought to be mediated, at least in part, via its effects on adrenergic mechanisms, we evaluated the contribution of neuroendocrine stress axes, sympathoadrenal and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal, to the effect of duloxetine in preclinical models of oxaliplatin- and paclitaxel-induced CIPN. Systemic administration of duloxetine, which alone had no effect on nociceptive threshold, both prevented and reversed mechanical hyperalgesia associated with oxaliplatin- and paclitaxel-CIPN. It more robustly attenuated oxaliplatin CIPN in male rats, while it was more effective for paclitaxel CIPN in females. Gonadectomy attenuated these sex differences in the effect of duloxetine. To assess the role of neuroendocrine stress axes in the effect of duloxetine on CIPN, rats of both sexes were submitted to adrenalectomy combined with fixed level replacement of corticosterone and epinephrine. While CIPN, in these rats, was of similar magnitude to that observed in adrenal-intact animals, rats of neither sex responded to duloxetine. Furthermore, duloxetine blunted an increase in corticosterone induced by oxaliplatin, and prevented the exacerbation of CIPN by sound stress.

The first, second, and third stages of the algorithm consist of pregabalin, duloxetine, and oxycodone, respectively. We examined the usefulness and safety of the treatment algorithm for 27 patients with colorectal cancer by evaluating the side effects and degree of improvement of subjective symptoms. When discontinuation was necessary due to adverse events or invalid treatment during the 4-week study period, the patient was transitioned to the next stage. The response rates of the first, second, and third stages of the algorithm were 33% (9/27), 33% (6/18), and 17% (1/6), respectively, whereas the overall response rate was 59% (16/27). The side effect rates of the first, second, and third stages were 37% (10/27), 33% (6/18), and 83% (5/6), respectively. Somnolence was the most common side effect of these drugs.

Macroscopic and microscopic evaluation was performed at each of the 6 time-points during the 28-day follow-up. Macroscopically, treatment resulted in erythema and mild edema that quickly resolved. Microscopically, there was progressive re-coverage of the tested sites with complete, well differentiated, newly formed epidermis, associated with efficient elimination of the underlying excised dermis, which was replaced by maturing fibroplasia. Some of the sites demonstrated complete healing already after 7 days. No significant adverse events were noted with the use of the device. The use of the micro-coring device AimeTM in a porcine model for skin fractional micro-excision and resurfacing was effective and safe. The comprehensive gradual healing process shown in this study with detailed histopathological images can also serve as a basis for future pre-clinical studies of fractional ablative devices.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36262685": "UNLABELLED: Micro-coring technology (MCT) removes cores of skin without formation of scars, thereby tightening skin and reducing skin wrinkling. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of MCT with the dermal micro-coring device for the treatment of facial wrinkles.\nMETHODS: This prospective, multicenter clinical trial included fifty-one subjects who underwent MCT treatments of the mid to lower face. The primary study endpoint was change in the Lemperle Wrinkle Severity Scale. Secondary study endpoints were change in Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS), participant satisfaction, and evaluation of treatment outcome by an independent review panel. All study endpoints were evaluated at 1, 7, 30, 60, and 150 or 180 days after treatment. Procedure bleeding, pain, and early healing profile were also captured.\nRESULTS: The mean Lemperle Wrinkle Severity Scale change was 1.3 grades. Improvement in the GAIS was reported for 89.7% (87/97) of treated sites, and average improvement of GAIS was 1.5. Participants reported satisfaction with 85.6% of treatment sites. The independent review panel correctly identified 84.2% of the post-treatment photographs as post-treatment. Procedure bleeding and pain was mild with good healing responses and patient-reported average down time of 3 days.\nCONCLUSIONS: The results of this study demonstrate the safety and efficacy of MCT with the dermal micro-coring device for the treatment of moderate to severe facial wrinkles.

However, a detailed study, revealing the full spectrum of endometriosis and IBS comorbidities in the same study population, is lacking.\nSTUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This article presents a retrospective in silico analysis of the data from a large nationwide biobank-based cohort consisting of 121\u200a773 women. After excluding all first- and second-degree relatives, the data of up to 65\u200a421 women were analyzed.\nPARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: International Classification of Disease-10 diagnosis main codes associated with endometriosis (N80) and IBS (K58) diagnoses were identified from the Estonian Biobank dataset by linking with the Estonian Health Insurance Fund and other relevant registries. The associations between N80 and K58 and other diagnosis codes were tested using logistic regression, adjusting for age at recruitment and 10 genetic principal components to account for potential population stratification. Bonferroni correction was applied to account for multiple testing.\nMAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Both women with endometriosis and IBS suffered from more conditions compared to the control group, with 226 and 428 diagnosis codes statistically significantly more frequent in women with respective diagnosis compared to controls. Women suffering from both conditions had 275 significantly associated comorbidities. A remarkable proportion of women with IBS or endometriosis suffered also from endometriosis (9.0%) or IBS (13.6%), respectively. In endometriosis, the most prevalent diagnoses were related to diseases of the genitourinary system (33 N-category codes) and in women with IBS, the most associated diagnoses were related to digestive disorders and gastrointestinal tract (52 codes from K-category). Among the most significant diagnoses in endometriosis were uterine leiomyomas (D25), menstrual disorders (N92) and infertility (N97) (P\u2009<\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u200910-315 for all), and in IBS, lactose intolerance (E73), gastritis and duodenitis (K29) and functional dyspepsia (K30) were in the top list of most significant comorbidities (P\u2009<\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u200910-315 for all).\nLIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: The information about the severity stages of endometriosis and subtypes of IBS was not available for analysis. The findings may not be fully extrapolated to all female populations, because all participants were from one geographic area and had good access to health services.\nWIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: These findings support previous studies that have found a high prevalence of pre-selected comorbidities in women with endometriosis and IBS. However, taking into account the differences in the full spectrum of comorbidities of endometriosis and IBS may aid in diagnosing these disorders. Women and healthcare providers need to be aware that women with endometriosis are at high risks of complications during pregnancy and should be carefully monitored.\nSTUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S): This research was funded by the Estonian Research Council (grant PRG1076), Horizon 2020 innovation grant (ERIN, grant no.

There is interest in deescalating local therapy after a clinical complete response to CRT. We hypothesized that a watch-and-wait (WW) strategy offers comparable cancer-specific survival, superior quality-adjusted survival, and reduced cost compared with upfront TME.\nMETHODS: We developed a decision-analytic model to compare WW, low anterior resection, and abdominoperineal resection for patients achieving a clinical complete response to CRT. Rates of local regrowth, pelvic recurrence, and distant metastasis were derived from series comparing WW with TME after pathologic complete response. Lifetime incremental costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) were calculated between strategies, and sensitivity analyses were performed to study model uncertainty.\nRESULTS: The base case 5-year cancer-specific survival was 93.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 91.5% to 94.9%) on a WW program compared with 95.9% (95% CI = 93.6% to 97.4%) after upfront TME.

However, some novel clinical approaches could achieve better functional results, such as Robotic Resection, or avoiding surgical procedure and incrementing surveillance intensity, called\u202fWatch-and-Wait\u202fpolicy. We use computational techniques to compare these clinical approaches using quality adjusted life years (QALYs).\nMETHODS: A Markov decision analytic model was used in order to perform a cost-utility analysis, comparing standard resection (SR), Robotic Rectal Resection (RRR) and\u202fWatch-and-Wait\u202f(WW) strategies, estimating the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio per QALY to be gained from patients reaching a clinical complete response to chemoradiotherapy. Model parameter estimates were informed by previously published studies comparing WW to SR and from our database of RRR versus SR. Lifetime incremental cost-utility ratio was calculated among approaches, and a sensitivity analysis were performed in order to estimate the model uncertainty. A willingness-to-pay of per one additional QALY gained was measured to determine which strategies would be most cost-effective.\nRESULTS: WW is a dominating option over SR ( -75,486. 75 \u20ac and +2.04 QALYs) and RRR ( -75,486. 75 \u20ac and +0.41 QALYs).

WW saves costs in 99.98% of the simulations when compared with either SR or RRR but only 86.9% and 55.38% (respectively) of these fall within the SR quadrant. WW is only more effective than SR 55% of the time which implies a significant uncertainty due to the high utility value assigned to cCR after chemoradiotherapy in the RRR alternative.\nCONCLUSION: This study provides data of cost-effectiveness differences among Standard Surgery, Watch-and-Wait and Robotic Resection approaches in clinical complete response in locally advanced rectal cancer patients after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, showing a benefit for Watch-and-Wait policy.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34529175": "BACKGROUND: Watch and wait (WW) protocols have gained increasing popularity for patients diagnosed with locally advanced rectal cancer and presumed complete clinical response after neoadjuvant chemoradiation.

We sought to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis comparing WW with abdominoperineal resection (APR) and low anterior resection (LAR) among patients with stage II/III rectal cancer.\nMETHODS: In this comparative-effectiveness study, we built Markov microsimulation models to simulate disease progression, death, costs, and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for WW or APR/LAR. We assessed cost effectiveness using the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), with ICERs under $100,000/QALY considered cost effective. Probabilities of disease progression, death, and health utilities were extracted from published, peer-reviewed literature. We assessed costs from the payer perspective.\nRESULTS: WW dominated both LAR and APR at a willingness to pay (WTP) threshold of $100,000. Our model was most sensitive to rates of distant recurrence and regrowth after WW. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated that WW was the dominant strategy over both APR and LAR over 100% of iterations across a range of WTP thresholds from $0-250,000.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests WW could reduce overall costs and increase effectiveness compared with either LAR or APR.

In recent years, therapies targeting senescent cells (senotherapies), particularly senolytics that selectively eliminate senescent cells, have been developed and show promise for treating geriatric syndromes and age-associated diseases, including CVDs. In 2 pilot studies published in 2019 the senolytic combination, dasatinib plus quercetin, improved physical function in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and eliminated senescent cells from adipose tissue in patients with diabetic kidney disease. More than 30 clinical trials using senolytics are currently underway or planned. In preclinical CVD models, senolytics appear to improve heart failure, ischemic heart disease, valvular heart disease, atherosclerosis, aortic aneurysm, vascular dysfunction, dialysis arteriovenous fistula patency, and pre-eclampsia. Because senotherapies are completely different strategies from existing treatment paradigms, they might alleviate diseases for which there are no current effective treatments or they could be used in addition to current therapies to enhance efficacy. Moreover, senotherapies might delay, prevent, alleviate or treat multiple diseases in the elderly and reduce polypharmacy, because senotherapies target fundamental aging mechanisms.

Therefore, we aimed to evaluate natural infection by spotted fever group (SFG) Rickettsia spp. in dogs and ticks collected from domiciles close to forest fragments, featuring domestic-wildlife interface areas. Samples from 115 dogs and 135 ixodids were assessed by polymerase chain reactions (PCR) targeting the gltA gene for Rickettsia spp. and the ompA gene for the SFG rickettsial species. One dog (0.87%; 1/115) was positive for R. rickettsii. This dog presented nonspecific laboratory and clinical abnormalities (thrombocytopenia, hyperproteinemia, lymph node enlargement, emaciation, anorexia, and lethargy). Rickettsia parkeri was identified in 2.96% (4/135) of the ticks (Amblyomma sculptum, A. aureolatum, and Rhipicephalus sanguineus). This study confirmed the presence of SFG bacteria in non-endemic and preserved locations, where domestic and wild populations interact.

From each capybara, we collected blood sera that were tested through the immunofluorescence assay using Rickettsia spp. antigens, and A. sculptum ticks, processed for isolation of R. rickettsii through guinea pig inoculation. All capybaras (100%) were seroreactive to Rickettsia spp., with highest titers to R. rickettsii. A total of 166 A. sculptum ticks were macerated and inoculated into nine guinea pigs, from which only one presented high fever and seroconverted to R. rickettsii. Blood from this febrile animal was inoculated into additional guinea pigs (guinea pig passages), which also became febrile and seroconverted, or when euthanized during the fever period, their internal organs (spleen, lung) were shown to contain R. rickettsii DNA. The present rickettsial isolate has been maintained cryopreserved as infected guinea pig organs. There was at least one R. rickettsii-infected tick among the 166 macerated ticks, giving a minimal infection rate of 0.6% (1/166). This infection rate is within the range of previous studies, which reported that only 0.05% to at most 1.28% A. sculptum ticks were infected by R. rickettsii in other BSF-endemic areas.

Background similarity tests comparing the ENMs of R. rickettsii, tick vectors, and mammalian hosts were unable to reject null hypotheses of niche similarity.

This occurs in \u223c10% of patients with metastatic CRC (mCRC) and is a marker of poor prognosis.\nDESIGN: Herein, we review the clinical and translational literature on the role of the BRAF V600E mutation in the pathogenesis of mCRC, its mechanisms as a prognostic marker, and its potential utility as a predictive marker of treatment response. We then summarize the current evidence-based recommendations for management of BRAF V600E-mutated mCRC, with a focus on recent clinical research advances in this setting.\nRESULTS: The current standard therapies for first-line treatment of BRAF-mutated mCRC are chemotherapy with bevacizumab as well as 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan (FOLFOXIRI) plus bevacizumab in patients with a good performance status.

In early-stage setting, the identification of the BRAF mutation does not impact the therapeutic decision. Yet, the BRAF mutation could be considered as a stratification factor in adjuvant trials, because of its prognostic impact after relapse. Moreover, both BRAF mutation and mismatch repair (MMR) statuses should be determined in all CRC to help identify sporadic tumors versus Lynch syndrome-related tumors. Indeed, in patients with MMR-deficient (dMMR) tumors and MLH1 loss of expression, the BRAFV600E mutation indicates a sporadic origin. In advanced BRAF-mutated CRC, the standard of care remains fluoropyrimidine-based cytotoxic regimen in combination with bevacizumab. Although a recent meta-analysis showed that there was insufficient data to justify the exclusion of anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies, antiangiogenic agents should be preferred in the first-line setting. Despite the lack of a randomized phase 3 study dedicated to BRAF-mutated CRC, chemotherapy intensification combining a quadruple association of 5-fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, irinotecan (FOLFOXIRI), and bevacizumab seems like a valid option. Although first results with BRAF inhibitors as single agents in BRAF-mutated CRC were disappointing, their association with therapies targeting the MAPK pathway seems to overcome the primary resistance to BRAF inhibition. In the field of sporadic CRC, the BRAF mutation is strongly associated with MMR deficiency. Considering breakthrough results of immune checkpoint inhibitors in dMMR repair tumors, determination of the MMR status appears to be mandatory.

Mortality rates calculated using age-adjusted US census data expressed in rate per 100,000 individuals. Trends analyzed using the National Cancer Institute Joinpoint Regression Program (version 4.7.0; Bethesda, Maryland).\nRESULTS: 1187 epiglottitis-related deaths were identified over thirty-nine years. Total deaths decreased from 65 in 1979 to 15 in 2017. Adult deaths accounted for 63.5% and decreased from 0.015 per 100,000 individuals (24 deaths) in 1979 to 0.006 per 100,000 individuals (14 deaths) in 2017. Best fitting log-liner regression model showed APC of -3.5% (95% CI, -4.2 to -2.7%) from 1979 to 2017.

The median age increased from 35.5 months in the earlier period to 80.5 months (P = .007). Overall, H influenzae type b was identified as the causative organism in 76% of patients, but in only 25% of the cases since 1990 (P = .004). Of the eight cases from 1990 through 1992, three had group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus isolated from a surface culture of the epiglottis; three other cases of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus were identified earlier. These patients were significantly older than those with H influenzae type b disease (117.5 vs 35 months, P = .004). No important differences were found in any of a number of clinical characteristics based on causative organism or year of diagnosis.\nCONCLUSION: Acute epiglottitis has diminished in frequency since 1990. Patients whose conditions have been diagnosed since then tend to be older and to have disease caused by organisms other than H influenzae type b (particularly group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus).

FRDA is characterized by ataxia, loss of gait, scoliosis, cardiomyopathy, dysarthria and dysphagia, with reduced life expectancy. The disease onset is usually in adolescence, leading to progressive disability. Omaveloxolone has been recently approved as the first pharmacological treatment for FRDA in adults and adolescents aged 16\u2009years and older. Regarding non-pharmacological therapies, neurorehabilitation is a valuable aid in addressing the symptoms and in maintaining the residual functioning. We performed a prospective observational cohort study to evaluate the efficacy of inpatient rehabilitation (IR) for people with FRDA.\nMETHODS: A total of 42 individuals (29 adults and 13 children) with FRDA were recruited. There were 27 ambulant and 15 non-ambulant participants. The patients underwent IR of 3 and 4\u2009weeks in children and adults, respectively. The IR treatment was designed to be applied within a multidisciplinary setting, so FRDA patients underwent, in addition to physiotherapy, also occupational therapy, practical manual activities and psychological support aiming to enhance transferable skills useful in the activities of daily living. The primary outcome was the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA). Other measures were: Friedreich Ataxia Rating Scale (FARS) and Nine Hole Peg Test (NHPT). Furthermore, we used the 6\u2009Minute Walk Test (6MWT), the Timed Up and Go (TUG) and the Berg Balance Scale (BBS) only on ambulant subjects.

In the setting of a pre-existing colorectal carcinoma this would constitute a hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer, Lynch 2 syndrome, accounting for 5 to 10% of colon cancer cases. We unveil a case of 'giant' ovarian tumors mimicking primary ovarian cancer; ostensibly the first reported in East Africa.\nCASE PRESENTATION: A 58-year-old African woman was diagnosed with colorectal adenocarcinoma in June 2009. She had a right hemicolectomy with the tumor staged as regional cancer, following histopathological examination. Chemotherapy was administered both adjuvantly and 1 year later for what was thought to be a recurrence of tumor. Despite this, her general condition deteriorated. Following re-evaluation and an exploratory laparotomy she was found to have bilateral 'giant' ovarian tumors, with peritoneal seedlings and subcutaneous metastases (colonic in origin). A bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy was done, accompanied by histopathological analysis with institution of chemotherapy for ovarian cancer. Following immunohistochemistry tests and microsatellite instability analysis it was found that the ovarian tumors were secondaries from the colon. She was also identified as a Lynch syndrome case or a case of sporadic microsatellite instability, although with no suggestive family cancer history. The treatment regimen was changed to suit metastatic disease.\nCONCLUSIONS: The case presents a diagnostic and thus treatment conundrum. Two primary tumors (suspected Lynch syndrome) had been perceived yet there is actually only metastatic colorectal cancer. We also have a rare and unusual metastatic presentation: 'giant' bilateral ovarian tumors and subcutaneous nodules, concurrently. Further still, she is a case of probable Lynch syndrome, requiring genetic analysis for definitive classification and surveillance for hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer-associated cancers.Important inferences are drawn. Firstly, 'giant' ovarian tumors diagnosed as primary ovarian cancer may actually be colonic secondaries. Secondly, immunohistochemistry and microsatellite instability analysis tests ought to be part of the diagnostic package in colon cancer management, particularly for identifying tumor origin and the Lynch syndrome (a condition which has had little attention in resource-limited countries).

Individuals presenting with colorectal cancer are diagnosed with Lynch I, whereas individuals who present with extra-colonic tumors (such as endometrial, stomach, etc.) are identified as patients with Lynch syndrome II. Recently, 30 families have been reported with inheritance of biallelic mutations in the MMR genes. Here we summarize the phenotype of individuals with inheritance of homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the MMR genes that result in a complete lack of protein or greatly compromised protein function. In contrast to individuals with Lynch syndrome I and II, individuals with no MMR function present with childhood onset of hematological and brain malignancies, whereas residual MMR function can also result in gastrointestinal cancers and an age of onset in the second to fourth decade. Individuals with biallelic MMR mutations often present with caf\u00e9-au-lait spots, regardless of the level of MMR function remaining.

Other cancers associated with Lynch syndrome include cancers of the ovary, stomach, urothelial tract, and small bowel, and less frequently, cancers of the brain, biliary tract, pancreas, and prostate. The oncogenic tendency of Lynch syndrome stems from a set of genomic alterations of mismatch repair proteins. Defunct mismatch repair proteins cause unusually high instability of regions of the genome called microsatellites. Over time, the accumulation of mutations in microsatellites and elsewhere in the genome can affect the production of important cellular proteins, spurring tumorigenesis. Universal testing of colorectal tumors for microsatellite instability (MSI) is now recommended to (a) prevent cases of Lynch syndrome being missed owing to the use of clinical criteria alone, (b) reduce morbidity and mortality among the relatives of affected individuals, and (c) guide management decisions. Organ-specific cancer risks and associated screening paradigms vary according to the sex of the affected individual and the type of germline DNA alteration causing the MSI. Furthermore, Lynch syndrome-associated cancers have different pathologic, radiologic, and clinical features compared with their sporadic counterparts. Most notably, Lynch syndrome-associated tumors tend to be more indolent than non-Lynch syndrome-associated neoplasms and thus may respond differently to traditional chemotherapy regimens. The high MSI in cases of colorectal cancer reflects a difference in the biologic features of the tumor, possibly with a unique susceptibility to immunotherapy. \u00a9RSNA, 2018.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38039991": "BACKGROUND: Concurrent chemoradiotherapy has been the standard of care for locally advanced cervical cancer for over 20 years; however, 30-40% of treated patients have recurrence or progression within 5 years. Immune checkpoint inhibition has improved outcomes for patients with PD-L1 positive metastatic or recurrent cervical cancer. We assessed the benefit of adding durvalumab, a PD-L1 antibody, with and following chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced cervical cancer.\nMETHODS: The CALLA randomised, double-blind, phase 3 trial included 105 hospitals across 15 countries.

Median follow-up was 18\u00b75 months (IQR 13\u00b72-21\u00b75) in the durvalumab group and 18\u00b74 months (13\u00b72-23\u00b77) in the placebo group. At data cutoff, median progression-free survival had not been reached (95% CI not reached-not reached) for either group (HR 0\u00b784; 95% CI 0\u00b765-1\u00b708; p=0\u00b717); 12-month progression-free survival was 76\u00b70% (71\u00b73-80\u00b70) with durvalumab and 73\u00b73% (68\u00b74-77\u00b75) with placebo. The most frequently reported grade 3-4 adverse events in both groups were anaemia (76 [20%] of 385 in the durvalumab group vs 56 [15%] of 384 in the placebo group) and decreased white blood cells (39 [10%] vs 49 [13%]). Serious adverse events occurred for 106 (28%) patients who received durvalumab and 89 (23%) patients who received placebo.

Prognostic factors in univariate and multivariate analyses also included age and sex.\nRESULTS: Five-year survival rates were 41.3% after pulmonary excision and 73.1% after primary colorectal resection. Three factors identified as significant by univariate log-rank test for overall survival after pulmonary resection were carcinoembryonic antigen (p < 0.0001), tumor laterality (p = 0.0205), and number of pulmonary metastases (p = 0.0028). Multivariate analysis found that carcinoembryonic antigen, tumor number, tumor size, and patient's age were also independent prognostic factors. In contrast, carcinoembryonic antigen, number of metastases, and disease-free interval predicted prognosis after primary colorectal resection. Prior hepatectomy for metastases did not influence prognosis after pulmonary metastasectomy.\nCONCLUSIONS: Elevated carcinoembryonic antigen level and multiple metastases are preoperative predictors of poor prognosis after resection of pulmonary metastases from colorectal cancer. Survival rate is sufficient to justify pulmonary metastasectomy if there is no local or distant metastatic lesion other than in the liver; if needed, sequential pulmonary and hepatic metastasectomy can be performed.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10749608": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate retrospectively the long-term results of an approach consisting of performing surgery in every patient in whom radical removal of all metastatic disease was technically feasible.\nSUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: The indications for surgical resection for liver metastases from colorectal cancer remain controversial. Several clinical risk factors have been reported to influence survival.\nMETHODS: Between March 1980 and December 1997, 235 patients underwent hepatic resection for metastatic colorectal cancer. Survival rates and disease-free survival as a function of clinical and pathologic determinants were examined retrospectively with univariate and multivariate analyses.\nRESULTS: The overall 3-, 5-, 10-, and 15-year survival rates were 51%, 38%, 26%, and 24%, respectively. The stage of the primary tumor, lymph node metastasis, and multiple nodules were significantly associated with a poor prognosis in both univariate and multivariate analyses. Disease-free survival was significantly influenced by lymph node metastasis, a short interval between treatment of the primary and metastatic tumors, and a high preoperative level of carcinoembryonic antigen. The 10-year survival rate of patients with four or more nodules (29%) was better than that of patients with two or three nodules (16%), and similar to that of patients with a solitary lesion (32%).\nCONCLUSIONS: Surgical resection is useful for treating liver metastases from colorectal cancer.

The prognosis of the patients with liver metastases from colorectal cancer is poor. Surgical resection, radiofrequency ablation, and chemotherapy had been used in clinical treatment for liver metastasis from colorectal cancer with various outcomes. This study was to explore the treatment efficacy of surgical management for liver metastasis from colorectal cancer.\nMETHODS: Clinical data of 198 patients with liver metastasis from colorectal cancer, treated from Jan. 1995 to Jan. 2000, were studied retrospectively. Of the 198 patients, 46 (23.2%) received radical resection, 43 (21.7%) received palliative resection, 29 (14.6%) received exploratory operation or supportive treatment, 41 (20.7%) received adjuvant hepatic arterial infusion, and 39 (19.7%) received adjuvant systemic chemotherapy. Survival statuses of the patients in different groups were compared.\nRESULTS: The median survival time of radical resection group was significantly longer than those of palliative resection group, exploratory operation or supportive treatment group, adjuvant hepatic arterial infusion group, and adjuvant systemic chemotherapy group (37.1 months vs. 14.3, 6.3, 21.3, and 18.7 months, P<0.01). The 5-year survival rates of the 5 groups were 31.2%, 0, 0, 7.5%, and 0, respectively.\nCONCLUSIONS: Radical resection could improve survival of the patients with liver metastasis from colorectal cancer.

We aimed to identify the key networks recruited by the epileptic process of LGS using interictal 2-deoxy-2-(18F)fluoro-D-glucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG-PET).\nMETHODS: Group analysis of cerebral 18F-FDG-PET, comparing 21 patients with LGS (mean age\u00a0=\u00a015 years) and 18 pseudo-controls (mean age\u00a0=\u00a019 years), studied at Austin Health Melbourne, between 2004 and 2015. To minimise the influence of individual patient lesions in the LGS group, we only studied brain hemispheres without structural MRI abnormalities. The pseudo-control group consisted of age- and sex-matched patients with unilateral temporal lobe epilepsy, using only the hemispheres contralateral to the side of epilepsy. Voxel-wise permutation testing compared 18F-FDG-PET uptake between groups. Associations were explored between areas of altered metabolism and clinical variables (age of seizure onset, proportion of life with epilepsy, and verbal/nonverbal ability). Penetrance maps were calculated to explore spatial consistency of altered metabolic patterns across individual patients with LGS.\nRESULTS: Although not always readily apparent on visual inspection of individual patient scans, group analysis revealed hypometabolism in a network of regions including prefrontal and premotor cortex, anterior and posterior cingulate, inferior parietal lobule, and precuneus (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05, corrected for family-wise error). These brain regions tended to show a greater reduction in metabolism in non-verbal compared to verbal LGS patients, although this difference was not statistically significant. No areas of hypermetabolism were detected on group analysis, although \u223c25 % of individual patients showed increased metabolism (relative to pseudo-controls) in the brainstem, putamen, thalamus, cerebellum, and pericentral cortex.\nDISCUSSION: Interictal hypometabolism in frontoparietal cortex in LGS is compatible with our previous EEG-fMRI and SPECT studies showing that interictal bursts of generalised paroxysmal fast activity and tonic seizures recruit similar cortical regions.

Pooled incidence and prevalence rates were estimated through random-effects meta-analysis.\nRESULTS: From 1,939 abstracts, 20 studies were fully appraised and 12 were included in the final review. Pooled NF1 prevalence was 1 in 3,164 (95%CI: 1 in 2,132-1 in 4,712).

Microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) is a key transcription factor for melanocyte development and differentiation. MITF regulates expression of numerous pigmentation genes to promote melanocyte differentiation, as well as fundamental genes for maintaining cell homeostasis, including genes encoding proteins involved in apoptosis (eg, BCL2) and the cell cycle (eg, CDK2). Loss-of-function mutations of MITF cause Waardenburg syndrome type IIA, whose phenotypes include depigmentation due to melanocyte loss, whereas amplification or specific mutation of MITF can be an oncogenic event that is seen in a subset of familial or sporadic melanomas. In this article, we review basic features of MITF biological function and highlight key unresolved questions regarding this remarkable transcription factor.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30150413": "The close integration of the MAPK, PI3K, and WNT signaling pathways underpins much of development and is deregulated in cancer. In principle, combinatorial posttranslational modification of key lineage-specific transcription factors would be an effective means to integrate critical signaling events. Understanding how this might be achieved is central to deciphering the impact of microenvironmental cues in development and disease. The microphthalmia-associated transcription factor MITF plays a crucial role in the development of melanocytes, the retinal pigment epithelium, osteoclasts, and mast cells and acts as a lineage survival oncogene in melanoma. MITF coordinates survival, differentiation, cell-cycle progression, cell migration, metabolism, and lysosome biogenesis. However, how the activity of this key transcription factor is controlled remains poorly understood. Here, we show that GSK3, downstream from both the PI3K and Wnt pathways, and BRAF/MAPK signaling converges to control MITF nuclear export. Phosphorylation of the melanocyte MITF-M isoform in response to BRAF/MAPK signaling primes for phosphorylation by GSK3, a kinase inhibited by both PI3K and Wnt signaling. Dual phosphorylation, but not monophosphorylation, then promotes MITF nuclear export by activating a previously unrecognized hydrophobic export signal. Nonmelanocyte MITF isoforms exhibit poor regulation by MAPK signaling, but instead their export is controlled by mTOR. We uncover here an unanticipated mode of MITF regulation that integrates the output of key developmental and cancer-associated signaling pathways to gate MITF flux through the import-export cycle.

Here, we review literature on the transcription factors that co-regulate MITF-dependent genes. ChIP-seq studies have indicated that the transcription factors SOX10, YY1, and TFAP2A co-occupy subsets of regulatory elements bound by MITF in melanocytes. Analyses at single loci also support roles for LEF1, RB1, IRF4, and PAX3 acting in combination with MITF, while sequence motif analyses suggest that additional transcription factors colocalize with MITF at many melanocyte-specific regulatory elements.

In the MEDLEY phase 2-3 trial in infants at higher risk for severe RSV infection, nirsevimab showed a similar safety profile to that of palivizumab. The aim of the current analysis was to assess the efficacy of nirsevimab using a weight-banded dosing regimen in infants born between 29 weeks gestational age and full term.\nMETHODS: Infants enrolled in the phase 2b and MELODY trials were randomised (2:1) to receive a single intramuscular injection of nirsevimab (infants weighing <5 kg received 50 mg; those weighing \u22655 kg received 100 mg) or placebo before the RSV season. Infants in MEDLEY were randomised (2:1) to receive one dose of nirsevimab (infants weighing <5 kg received 50 mg; those weighing \u22655 kg received 100 mg) followed by four monthly placebo doses, or five once-a-month intramuscular doses of palivizumab. We report a prespecified pooled efficacy analysis assessing the weight-banded dosing regimen proposed on the basis of the phase 2b and MELODY trials, in addition to extrapolated efficacy in infants with chronic lung disease, congenital heart disease, or extreme preterm birth (<29 weeks' gestational age) based on pharmacokinetic data from the phase 2-3 MEDLEY safety trial. For the pooled efficacy analysis, the primary endpoint was incidence of medically attended RSV LRTI through 150 days post-dose. The secondary efficacy endpoint was number of admissions to hospital for medically attended RSV LRTI. The incidence of very severe RSV LRTI was an exploratory endpoint, defined as cases of hospital admission for medically attended RSV LRTI that required supplemental oxygen or intravenous fluids. We also did a prespecified exploratory analysis of medically attended LRTI of any cause (in the investigator's judgement) and hospital admission for respiratory illness of any cause (defined as any upper respiratory tract infection or LRTI leading to hospital admission). Post hoc exploratory analyses of outpatient visits and antibiotic use were also done. Nirsevimab serum concentrations in MEDLEY were assessed using population pharmacokinetic methods and the pooled data from the phase 2b and MELODY trials. An exposure target was defined on the basis of an exposure-response analysis. To successfully demonstrate extrapolation, more than 80% of infants in MEDLEY had to achieve serum nirsevimab exposures at or above the predicted efficacious target.\nFINDINGS: Overall, 2350 infants (1564 in the nirsevimab group and 786 in the placebo group) in the phase 2b and MELODY trials were included in the pooled analysis. Nirsevimab showed efficacy versus placebo with respect to the primary endpoint of medically attended RSV LRTI (19 [1%] nirsevimab recipients vs 51 [6%] placebo recipients; relative risk reduction [RRR] 79\u00b75% [95% CI 65\u00b79-87\u00b77]). Consistent efficacy was shown for additional endpoints of RSV LRTI hospital admission (nine [1%] nirsevimab recipients vs 21 [3%] placebo recipients; 77\u00b73% [50\u00b73-89\u00b77]) and very severe RSV (five [<1%] vs 18 [2%]; 86\u00b70% [62\u00b75-94\u00b78]). Nirsevimab recipients had fewer hospital admissions for any-cause respiratory illness (RRR 43\u00b78% [18\u00b78-61\u00b71]), any-cause medically attended LRTI (35\u00b74% [21\u00b75-46\u00b79]), LRTI outpatient visits (41\u00b79% [25\u00b77-54\u00b76]), and antibiotic prescriptions (23\u00b76% [3\u00b78-39\u00b73]). Among infants with chronic lung disease, congenital heart disease, or extreme preterm birth in MEDLEY, nirsevimab serum exposures were similar to those found in the pooled data; exposures were above the target in more than 80% of the overall MEDLEY trial population (94%), including infants with chronic lung disease (94%) or congenital heart disease (80%) and those born extremely preterm (94%).\nINTERPRETATION: A single dose of nirsevimab protected healthy infants born at term or preterm from medically attended RSV LRTI, associated hospital admission, and severe RSV. Pharmacokinetic data support efficacy extrapolation to infants with chronic lung disease, congenital heart disease, or extreme prematurity. Together, these data suggest that nirsevimab has the potential to change the landscape of infant RSV disease by reducing a major cause of infant morbidity and the consequent burden on caregivers, clinicians, and health-care providers.\nFUNDING: AstraZeneca and Sanofi.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36577878": "Nirsevimab (Beyfortus\u00ae), a long-acting intramuscular recombinant neutralising human IgG1\u0138 monoclonal antibody to the prefusion conformation of the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) F protein that has been modified with a triple amino acid substitution in the Fc region to extend the serum half-life, is being jointly developed by AstraZeneca and Sanofi for the prevention of RSV disease.

This study examines the differences in patient characteristics, prevalence of complications and their effect on short-term survival, long-term survival and the rate of recurrence between RC and CC.\nMETHODS: For all stage II-III CC and RC patients who underwent resection with curative intent (2006-2008) in five hospitals in the Netherlands, occurrence of complications, crude survival, relative survival and recurrence rates were compared.\nRESULTS: A total of 767 CC and 272 RC patients underwent resection. Significant differences were found for age, gender, emergency surgery, T-stage and grade. CC patients experienced fewer complications compared to RC (p\u00a0=\u00a00.019), but CC patients had worse short-term mortality rates (1.5 versus 6.7\u00a0% for 30-day mortality, p\u00a0=\u00a00.001 and 5.2 versus 9.5\u00a0% for 90-day mortality, p\u00a0=\u00a00.032). The adjusted HR (overall survival) for CC patients with complications was 1.57 (1.23-2.01; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) as compared to patients without complications; for RC, the HR was 1.79 (1.12-2.87; p\u00a0=\u00a00.015). Relative survival analyses showed high excess mortality in the first months after surgery and a sustained, prolonged negative effect on both CC and RC. Complications were associated with a higher recurrence rate for both CC and RC; adjusted analyses showed a trend towards a significant association.\nCONCLUSION: Large differences exist in patient characteristics and clinical outcomes between CC and RC.

Signet-ring cell carcinomas (SRC) and mucinous adenocarcinomas (MAC) are two relatively infrequent histological subtypes. However, little is known about the predictors of LNM and prognosis to support the feasibility of local excision in early-stage SRC and MAC.\nMETHODS: The Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results Database were used to identify all patients with pT1 adenocarcinomas, including conventional adenocarcinoma (AC), MAC, and SRC. The prevalence of LNM was assessed, and the long-term survival rate in the above three types of colorectal cancer was calculated.\nRESULTS: SRC accounted for 0.3% and MAC accounted for 4.4% of the entire cohort of colorectal adenocarcinomas. Compared to AC, MRC and SRC were more often located in the proximal colon, and exhibited a higher grade. The incidence of LNM in AC, MAC, and SRC was 10.6%, 17.2%, and 33.3% for colon cancers and 14.8%, 25.9%, and 46.2% for rectal cancers, respectively. In patients with lymph nodes resected no less than 12, incidence of LNM in AC, MRC, and SRC was 12%, 21%, and 44% for colon tumors and 17%, 30%, and 14% for rectal tumors, respectively. Although, colon patients MAC showed an entirely worse survival rate than AC, rectum patients MAC showed a similar prognosis to AC. We found that in patients with rectal tumors, SRC had a worse 3 and 5-year prognosis than AC. However, for colon cancers, the prognosis of SRC was similar to that of AC. Histology was not found to be an independent prognostic factor in multivariate survival analysis.\nCONCLUSIONS: MAC and SRC are two distinct subtypes of colorectal cancer that require special attention despite their relatively rare prevalence. pT1 patients with SRC of the rectum and patients with MAC of the colon have higher incidences of LNM, and with these adverse outcomes, local excision is not recommended.

Forkhead box A1 (FOXA1) is a member of the forkhead box transcription factor family and functions as a pioneer factor of the estrogen receptor (ER) in breast cancer. In the present study, we demonstrate that FOXA1 mRNA was upregulated by estrogen and that estrogen receptor-\u03b1 (ER\u03b1) recruitment to ER-binding sites in the vicinity of the FOXA1 gene was increased by estrogen in ER\u03b1-positive MCF-7 breast cancer cells.

FOXA1 immunoreactivity was significantly elevated in the relapse-free breast cancer patients treated with tamoxifen.

These results suggest that FOXA1 plays an important role in the proliferation and migration of breast cancer cells by modulating estrogen signaling and that the double-positive immunoreactivities of FOXA1 and FOXP1 are associated with a favorable prognosis of tamoxifen-treated breast cancer.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17163418": "The transcription factor Forkhead-box A1 (Foxa1), a member of the FOX class of transcription factors, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of lung, esophageal and prostate cancers. We have recently identified transcriptional activation of p27 by FOXA1. In this study, we analyzed the activities and expression pattern of FOXA1 in breast cancer. Forced expression of FOXA1 inhibited clonal growth of breast cancer cell lines, and FOXA1 levels inversely correlated with growth stimuli. In the estrogen receptor (ER)-positive MCF-7 cells, FOXA1 increased p27 promoter activity and inhibited the ER pathway activity. Analysis of FOXA1 expression in breast tissue arrays revealed significantly higher expression in pure ductal carcinomas in situ compared to invasive ductal carcinomas (IDC); and in IDC, high expression of FOXA1 was associated with favorable prognostic factors. Yet, FOXA1 expression was noted in a subset of the ER-negative tumors. Taken together, our findings suggest a growth inhibitory role for FOXA1, and identify it as a novel, potential prognostic factor in breast cancer.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17671124": "PURPOSE: FOXA1, a forkhead family transcription factor, is essential for optimum expression of approximately 50% of estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha):estrogen responsive genes. FOXA1 is expressed in breast cancer cells. It segregates with genes that characterize the luminal subtypes in DNA microarray analyses. The utility of FOXA1 as a possible independent prognostic factor has not been determined in breast cancers.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: A tissue microarray comprising tumors from 438 patients with 15.4 years median follow-up was analyzed for FOXA1 expression by immunohistochemistry. Interpretable FOXA1 expression obtained in 404 patients was analyzed along with other prognostic factors like tumor grade, size, nodal status, ER, progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2/neu.\nRESULTS: FOXA1 expression (score >3) was seen in 300 of 404 breast cancers and it correlated with ER (P = 0.000001), PR (P = 0.00001), and luminal A subtype (P = 0.000001). Loss of expression was noted with worsening tumor grade (P = 0.001). Univariate analysis showed nodal status (P = 0.0000012), tumor size (P = 0.00001), FOXA1 (P = 0.0004), and ER (P = 0.012) to be predictors of breast cancer-specific survival. Multivariate analysis showed only nodal status (P = 0.001) and tumor size (P = 0.039) to be significant prognostic factors, whereas FOXA1 (P = 0.060) and ER (P = 0.131) were not significant. In luminal subtype A patient subgroup, FOXA1 expression was associated with better cancer-specific survival (P = 0.024) and in ER-positive subgroup, it was better predictor of cancer-specific survival (P = 0.009) than PR (P = 0.213).\nCONCLUSION: FOXA1 expression correlates with luminal subtype A breast cancer and it is significant predictor of cancer-specific survival in patients with ER-positive tumors. Prognostic ability of FOXA1 in these low-risk breast cancers may prove to be useful in clinical treatment decisions.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35829908": "BACKGROUND: Huntington's disease is a rare neurodegenerative illness of the central nervous system that is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. Mutant huntingtin protein\u00a0is produced as a result of enlargement of CAG repeat in the N-terminal of the polyglutamine tract.\nAIM OF THE STUDY: Herein, we aim to investigate the mutations and their effects on the HTT gene and its genetic variants. Additionally, the protein-protein interaction of HTT with other proteins and receptor-ligand interaction with the three-dimensional structure of huntingtin protein\u00a0were identified.\nMETHODS: A comprehensive analysis of the HTT interactome and protein-ligand interaction has been carried out to provide a global picture of structure-function analysis of huntingtin protein. Mutations were analyzed and mutation verification tools were used to check the effect of mutation on protein function.\nRESULTS: The results showed, mutations in a single gene are not only responsible for causing a particular disease but may also cause other hereditary disorders as well. Moreover, the modification at the nucleotide level also cause the change in the specific amino acid which may disrupt the function of HTT and its interacting proteins contributing in disease pathogenesis. Furthermore, the interaction between MECP2 and BDNF lowers the rate of transcriptional activity. Molecular docking further confirmed the strong interaction between MECP2 and BDNF with highest affinity. Amino acid residues of the HTT protein, involved in the interaction with tetrabenazine were N912, Y890, G2385, and V2320. These findings proved, tetrabenazine as one of the potential therapeutic agent for treatment of Huntington's disease.\nCONCLUSION: These results give further insights into the genetics of Huntington's disease for a better understanding of disease models which will be beneficial for the future therapeutic studies.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23904181": "Scabies remains a public health problem, especially in developing countries, with a worldwide incidence of approximately 300 million cases each year. Prolonged skin-to-skin contact is necessary to allow the transmission of the causative mite, Sarcoptes scabiei. Classic scabies presents with burrows, erythematous papules, and generalized pruritus. Clinical variants include nodular scabies and crusted scabies, also called Norwegian scabies. The diagnosis is based mainly on history and physical examination, but definitive diagnosis depends on direct visualization of the mites under microscopy. Alternative diagnostic methods include the burrow ink test, video-dermatoscopy, newly serologic tests like PCR/ELISA, and specific IgE directed toward major mite components. Treatment of scabies consists of either topical permethrin or oral ivermectin, although the optimal regimen is still unclear.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23205026": "BACKGROUND: Accurate diagnosis of scabies infection is important for patient treatment and for public health control of scabies epidemics.\nOBJECTIVE: To systematically review the accuracy and precision of history, physical examination and tests for diagnosing scabies.\nMETHODS: Using a structured search strategy, Medline and Embase databases were searched for English and French language articles that included a diagnosis of scabies. Studies comparing history, physical examination and/or any diagnostic tests with the reference standard of microscopic visualization of mites, eggs or fecal elements obtained from skin scrapings or biopsies were included for analysis. Data were extracted using standard criteria.\nRESULTS: History and examination of pruritic dermatoses failed to accurately diagnose scabies infection. Dermatoscopy by a trained practitioner has a positive likelihood ratio of 6.5 (95% CI 4.1 to 10.3) and a negative likelihood ratio of 0.1 (95% CI 0.06 to 0.2) for diagnosing scabies.

Patients could not have had a rash at the time of enrollment. All patients were randomly assigned to receive either tetracycline at a dose of 500 mg orally twice a day for 28 days versus a placebo. Patients were monitored for rash (through monthly physician assessment and weekly patient-reported questionnaires), quality of life (using the SKINDEX-16, a skin-specific quality of life index), and adverse events. Monitoring occurred during the 4-week intervention and then for an additional 4 weeks. The primary objective of the current study was to compare the incidence of rash between the study arms, and the enrollment of 30 patients per arm provided a 90% probability of detecting a 40% difference in incidence with a P value of .05 (2-sided).\nRESULTS: A total of 61 evaluable patients were enrolled. The 2 treatment arms were well balanced with regard to baseline characteristics, dropout rates, and rates of discontinuation of the EGFR inhibitor. The incidence of rash was found to be comparable across treatment arms. Physicians reported that 16 patients treated with tetracycline (70%) and 22 patients treated with placebo (76%) developed a rash (P = .61). Tetracycline appears to have lessened the rash severity, although the high dropout rates invite caution when interpreting these findings. By Week 4, physician-reported grade 2 rash (using the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [version 3.0]) occurred in 17% of tetracycline-treated patients (n = 4 patients) and in 55% of placebo-exposed patients (n = 16 patients) (P = .04). Patients treated with tetracycline reported better scores, as per the SKINDEX-16, on certain quality-of-life parameters such as skin burning or stinging, skin irritation, and being bothered by the persistence/recurrence of a skin condition.

Patients were stratified into 2 groups: those who received multimodal anesthesia (MM, n = 20) and those who received multimodal anesthesia with the addition of intraoperative methadone (MM + M, n = 20). Data collected included total opioid consumption during hospital stay (morphine milligram equivalents [MMEs]), hospital length of stay (LOS), pain scores, time to ambulation, and time to tolerating solid food.\nRESULTS: Addition of intraoperative methadone for patients undergoing MIRPE significantly reduced postoperative opioid requirements (MME/kg) during admission (P = .007). On average, patients in the MM group received 1.61 \u00b1 .55\u00a0MME/kg while patients in the MM + M group received 1.16 \u00b1 .44\u00a0MME/kg.

The paper aims at presenting the authors' own 6 years of experience in funnel chest repair with MIRPE technique. Also, many technical problems of this method are discussed.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 1999 and 2005, 461 patients (99 female and 362 male, aged 3-31 years, mean age 15.2 years) with pectus excavatum were operated with the Nuss technique. All patients were operated-on according to the original operative protocol proposed by Donald Nuss. With growing experience, own modifications were introduced. Insertion of two bars was done in 17.4%, transverse sternotomy in adolescents with rigid anterior chest wall in 7.8%, limited excision of the rib cartilages in 5.9%, and parasternal fixation of the bar to prevent it from rotating in 59.7% of patients.\nRESULTS: There were no deaths. Intraoperative complications were noted in 19 (4.1%) patients and postoperative ones were observed in 43 (9.3%) patients. The operative time ranged from 25 to 130 min (52 min on average). In 192 (41.6%) patients, an epidural block was used. The hospital stay ranged from 4 to 12 days with the mean of 5.3 days. A redo procedure for the bar rotation was necessary in 13 (2.8%) patients. The support bar has been removed in 260 (56.4%) patients so far. In all the patients, an adequate contour of the anterior chest wall has been maintained.\nCONCLUSIONS: MIRPE proposed by Nuss has all the features of a minimally invasive procedure and is straightforward. Better clinical results are achievable in patients under 12 years of age with a symmetric deformity. In older patients (over 15 years of age) with a rigid chest or with an asymmetric deformity, additional procedures are required to achieve a comprehensive correction of the deformity.

Under general anesthesia, a curved steel bar is inserted into the retrosternal tunnel between 2 bilateral midaxillary line incisions. The tunnel passes initially under the pectoral muscles and enters the pleural space at level of the mammilary line. Under thoracoscopic vision, the bar is passed through the tunnel with the concavity facing the front and then is turned over thereby correcting deformity.

Its management remains a challenge due to potential extracranial and intracranial complications. This study was designed to evaluate the recent experience with acute mastoiditis and its associated intracranial complications at a tertiary paediatric centre.\nMETHODS: A retrospective case note review was carried out for patients admitted to Alder Hey Children's Hospital between January 2006 and December 2016 with a diagnosis of acute mastoiditis. Patients were identified using ICD-10 codes H700, H701, H702, H708 and H709. A case note review was performed to identify patients with intracranial complications and data collected.\nRESULTS: 30 patients were identified with intracranial complications of acute mastoiditis, with 18 males and 12 females. The average age was 4 years and 2 months (range 2 months-15 years). The most common presenting complaint was otalgia and vomiting (63%), with only 27% patients presenting with mastoid swelling. 83% of patients were investigated with a combination of CT and MRI scans, 6.7% with CT scans only and 6.7% with MRI scans only. 73% were diagnosed with sinus thrombosis, 40% cerebral abscess and 33% postauricular subperiosteal abscess. 78% of the patients required surgical intervention. 27 of the 30 patients recovered fully with no significant long term sequalae following an average of 50 months follow-up.\nCONCLUSION: Intracranial complications of acute mastoiditis remain a significant challenge. Most patients tend to present without mastoid swelling, necessitating a high index of suspicion in patients with picket fence fever, vomiting, drowsiness, headaches, seizures or cranial nerve involvement. Most cases treated at our institution required acute surgical intervention in addition to adjuvant medical treatment with majority patients recovering fully.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32073562": "Acute mastoiditis is the most common complication of acute otitis media. Although rare, the disease is carefully studied by otolaryngologists because it usually affects very young children with severe clinical course and sometimes causes serious complications. Most important risk factors are the young age (often>2 years), high fever, alteration of the laboratory findings (very high values of WBC count, absolute neutrophil count and C-reactive protein), while less important are previous antibiotic therapy or previous middle ear infections. The main pathogen of the acute mastoiditis is Streptococcus pneumoniae, followed by Streptococcus piogenes, Haemophilus influentiae, and Staphylococcus aureus. The finding of Pseudomonas aeruginosa is not uncommon, but often its presence is often considered a contamination or simultaneous infection. The complications can be extracranial (subperiosteal abscess, Bezold's abscess); intratemporal (facial nerve palsy, labyrinthitis) and intracranial (subdural abscess). The complications have often a very serious clinical course and potentially life-threatening. Antibiotic therapy is the main treatment in not complicated forms. Considering the prevalence of Streptococcus pneumoniae, cephalosporins are the antibiotic of choice, but they have to be administrated intravenously in hospitalized patients. Combinations with other antibiotic are suggested when multibacterial flora is present. In complicated forms of acute mastoiditis, the antibiotic treatment can be particularly important, in combination with other specific drugs (i.e. anticoagulants and/or corticosteroids). Surgical treatments, such as incision of abscesses, mastoidectomy, and neurosurgical procedures, are sometimes performed in combination with medical therapy in very severe complications.

Across several benchmarks on clinical databases (ClinVar, COSMIC, OMIM), experimental functional assays (DMS, DepMap), and population genomic data (gnomAD), our model for the human genome achieves outstanding performance on deleteriousness prediction for both coding and non-coding variants.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37883436": "The expanding catalog of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) provides biological insights across a variety of species, but identifying the causal variants behind these associations remains a significant challenge.

Inspired by recent progress in natural language processing, unsupervised pretraining on large protein sequence databases has proven successful in extracting complex information related to proteins. These models showcase their ability to learn variant effects in coding regions using an unsupervised approach. Expanding on this idea, we here introduce the Genomic Pre-trained Network (GPN), a model designed to learn genome-wide variant effects through unsupervised pretraining on genomic DNA sequences. Our model also successfully learns gene structure and DNA motifs without any supervision. To demonstrate its utility, we train GPN on unaligned reference genomes of Arabidopsis thaliana and seven related species within the Brassicales order and evaluate its ability to predict the functional impact of genetic variants in A. thaliana by utilizing allele frequencies from the 1001 Genomes Project and a comprehensive database of GWAS. Notably, GPN outperforms predictors based on popular conservation scores such as phyloP and phastCons. Our predictions for A. thaliana can be visualized as sequence logos in the UCSC Genome Browser (https://genome.ucsc.edu/s/gbenegas/gpn-arabidopsis).

Gene regulatory code is highly complex due to the existence of polysemy and distant semantic relationship, which previous informatics methods often fail to capture especially in data-scarce scenarios.\nRESULTS: To address this challenge, we developed a novel pre-trained bidirectional encoder representation, named DNABERT, to capture global and transferrable understanding of genomic DNA sequences based on up and downstream nucleotide contexts. We compared DNABERT to the most widely used programs for genome-wide regulatory elements prediction and demonstrate its ease of use, accuracy and efficiency. We show that the single pre-trained transformers model can simultaneously achieve state-of-the-art performance on prediction of promoters, splice sites and transcription factor binding sites, after easy fine-tuning using small task-specific labeled data. Further, DNABERT enables direct visualization of nucleotide-level importance and semantic relationship within input sequences for better interpretability and accurate identification of conserved sequence motifs and functional genetic variant candidates. Finally, we demonstrate that pre-trained DNABERT with human genome can even be readily applied to other organisms with exceptional performance. We anticipate that the pre-trained DNABERT model can be fined tuned to many other sequence analyses tasks.\nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: The source code, pretrained and finetuned model for DNABERT are available at GitHub (https://github.com/jerryji1993/DNABERT).\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37426456": "Genomic (DNA) sequences encode an enormous amount of information for gene regulation and protein synthesis. Similar to natural language models, researchers have proposed foundation models in genomics to learn generalizable features from unlabeled genome data that can then be fine-tuned for downstream tasks such as identifying regulatory elements. Due to the quadratic scaling of attention, previous Transformer-based genomic models have used 512 to 4k tokens as context (<0.001% of the human genome), significantly limiting the modeling of long-range interactions in DNA. In addition, these methods rely on tokenizers or fixed k-mers to aggregate meaningful DNA units, losing single nucleotide resolution where subtle genetic variations can completely alter protein function via single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Recently, Hyena, a large language model based on implicit convolutions was shown to match attention in quality while allowing longer context lengths and lower time complexity. Leveraging Hyena's new long-range capabilities, we present HyenaDNA, a genomic foundation model pretrained on the human reference genome with context lengths of up to 1 million tokens at the single nucleotide-level - an up to 500x increase over previous dense attention-based models. HyenaDNA scales sub-quadratically in sequence length (training up to 160x faster than Transformer), uses single nucleotide tokens, and has full global context at each layer. We explore what longer context enables - including the first use of in-context learning in genomics.

With the use of self-expanding metallic stents, the prompt relief of large-bowel obstruction without surgery has become possible. This report describes our results in the use of self-expanding metallic stents in the treatment of left-sided colonic obstruction resulting from advanced malignancies.\nMETHODS: From November 1997 to March 1999, insertion of self-expanding metallic stents was attempted in 24 patients with acute left-sided colonic obstruction caused by primary or recurrent malignancies. All the procedures were performed by colorectal surgeons. The guidewire was inserted through the channel of the endoscope, and its position was confirmed with fluoroscopy. Uncovered Wallstent esophageal endoprostheses were used in all except the first case. The insertion and deployment of the stents were under both endoscopic and fluoroscopic guidance.\nRESULTS: There were 24 patients (15 males) with a mean age of 63.6 (range, 36-98) years. Thirteen patients had primary colorectal cancer and 11 had recurrent cancers (colorectal cancer, 5; gastric cancer, 5; other, 1). In the treatment of primary colorectal cancer, seven procedures were palliative, and no subsequent surgery was planned because of extensive liver metastasis or poor medical risk.

We assessed the dynamics of follicle formation, surface phenotypes and functional activity of lung B cells during TB course in genetically susceptible mice. The follicles appeared early post infection and peaked at weeks 7-8. Lung B cells resembled classical B2 cells (CD19+IgMloIgDhiCD1d-CD21/35intCD5-CD11b-CD43-), but differed from them by the absence of B2 marker CD23. Lung B-cells constitutively expressed MHC II molecules, presented mycobacterial antigens to immune CD4+ T-cells and produced high amounts of IL-6 and IL-11, but no classical type 1 (TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3), or anti-inflammatory (IL-10, TGF-\u03b2) cytokines. The total antibody response in tuberculous lung showed almost no specificity to mycobacteria. A panel of monoclonal antibodies obtained from lung B cells contained only few clones with reactivity to mycobacteria.

Simultaneous triggering of the BCR and CD21 lowers the threshold for B cell activation. Although CD21 is important, B cells that express low amounts or lack surface CD21 (CD21(-/low) ) are increased in conditions with chronic inflammation, e.g. autoimmune diseases. However, little is known about the CD21(-/low) B cell subset in peripheral blood from healthy donors. Here, we show that CD21(-/low) cells represent approximately 5% of B cells in peripheral blood from adults but are barely detectable in cord blood, after excluding transitional B cells. The CD21(-/low) subset can be divided into CD38(-) 24(+) and CD38(-) 24(low) cells, where most of the CD38(-) 24(+) are CD27(+) immunoglobulin (Ig)M(+) IgD(+) and the CD38(-) 24(low) are switched CD27(-) . Expression levels of additional markers, e.g. CD95 and CD62L, are similar to those on classical memory B cells. In contrast to naive cells, the majority of CD21(-/low) cells lack expression of the ABCB1 transporter. Stimulation with a combination of BCR, Toll-like receptor (TLR)-7/8 and\u00a0interleukin (IL)-2 induces proliferation and differentiation of the CD21(-/low) B cells comparable to CD21(+) CD27(+) memory B cells. The response excluding BCR agonist is not on par with that of classical memory B cells, although clearly above that of naive B cells. This is ascribed to a weaker response by the CD38(-) 24(low) subset, implying that some memory B\u00a0cells require not only TLR but also BCR triggering.

The line expresses the CD20+CD21+ phenotype. We studied whether CR2 receptor surface expression varied in relation to the cell cycle or state of differentiation in the 1:13 line. High CD21 and IgM expression occurred in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. In contrast to CD21, there were no distinctly brighter subpopulations of CD20 positive cells in the G1, S, or G2M compartments of the cell cycle. When sorted according to size, smaller cells were predominantly in G1, whereas a greater proportion of the larger cells were in the G2M phase of the cell cycle. The smaller 1:13 cells expressed more CD21 surface antigen and IgM than the larger cells. Cells which formed stable rosettes with TNP-SRBC expressed more surface IgM and CD21 antigen than nonrosetting cells.

From 1 January 1990 to 30 April 2018, we identified 973 281 new users of PPIs and 193 306 new users of H2RAs. Cox proportional hazards models were fit to estimate HRs and 95% CIs of gastric cancer, and the number needed to harm was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The models were weighted using standardised mortality ratio weights using calendar time-specific propensity scores. Secondary analyses assessed duration and dose-response associations.\nRESULTS: After a median follow-up of 5.0 years, the use of PPIs was associated with a 45% increased risk of gastric cancer compared with the use of H2RAs (HR 1.45, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.98).

However, the discovery that mammalian enhancers also initiate transcription questions the inherent differences between enhancers and promoters. Here, we investigate the transcriptional properties of enhancers during Drosophila embryogenesis using characterized developmental enhancers. We show that while the timing of enhancer transcription is generally correlated with enhancer activity, the levels and directionality of transcription are highly varied among active enhancers. To assess how this impacts function, we developed a dual transgenic assay to simultaneously measure enhancer and promoter activities from a single element in the same embryo. Extensive transgenic analysis revealed a relationship between the direction of endogenous transcription and the ability to function as an enhancer or promoter in vivo, although enhancer RNA (eRNA) production and activity are not always strictly coupled. Some enhancers (mainly bidirectional) can act as weak promoters, producing overlapping spatio-temporal expression. Conversely, bidirectional promoters often act as strong enhancers, while unidirectional promoters generally cannot. The balance between enhancer and promoter activity is generally reflected in the levels and directionality of eRNA transcription and is likely an inherent sequence property of the elements themselves.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31605096": "The proper activities of enhancers and gene promoters are essential for coordinated transcription within a cell.

Here we review these results, focusing on the factors that determine the promoter and/or enhancer activity of regulatory elements.

The low protein-coding potential of meRNAs suggests that many meRNAs may be byproducts of enhancer activation or underlie as-yet-unidentified RNA-encoded functions.

This upstream promoter domain can act as an efficient enhancer when polymerized and cloned adjacent to a ribosomal gene promoter injected into oocytes. A core promoter domain lacking similarity with spacer sequences in Xenopus laevis but analogous to a repeated sequence in Xenopus borealis can also function as an enhancer.

EDS causes a myriad of symptoms, including skin hyperextensibility and fragility, easy bruising and bleeding, joint hypermobility, subluxation, dislocation, and chronic pain. Pain is one of the most common symptoms of EDS, leading to disability and decreased quality of life. Current guidelines for treating chronic pain in EDS are lacking.

The second patient had a complicated history including longstanding EDS and multiple previous surgeries. She was referred due to concern about complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) in her upper extremity.\nDIAGNOSES: For the first patient, apart from chronic pain due to her EDS, her history also revealed that she suffered from kinesiophobia. For the second patient, a detailed clinical assessment revealed no signs of CRPS but instead a generalized worsening of EDS symptoms.\nINTERVENTIONS: Both patients were evaluated by the multidisciplinary team consisting of a pain physician, nurse, pain psychologist, and a kinesiologist. Their treatment involved optimization of daily medications, participation in pain self-management sessions that included cognitive behavioral therapy, graded exercises, coping, and relaxation strategies.\nOUTCOMES: Both patients demonstrated significantly better pain control and achieved overall improvement in daily living.\nLESSONS: EDS is a complex illness with a multitude of symptoms. As in our patients, EDS patients also suffer from panic and anxiety disorders that increase the burden of pain.

Tumor angiogenesis relies on a highly complex program of growth factor signaling, endothelial cell (EC) proliferation, extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, and stromal cell interactions. Numerous pro-angiogenic drivers have been identified, the most important of which is the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The importance of pro-angiogenic inducers in tumor growth, invasion and extravasation make them an excellent therapeutic target in several types of cancers. Hence, the number of anti-angiogenic agents developed for cancer treatment has risen over the past decade, with at least eighty drugs being investigated in preclinical studies and phase I-III clinical trials. To date, the most common approaches to the inhibition of the VEGF axis include the blockade of VEGF receptors (VEGFRs) or ligands by neutralizing antibodies, as well as the inhibition of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) enzymes. Despite promising preclinical results, anti-angiogenic monotherapies led only to mild clinical benefits. The minimal benefits could be secondary to primary or acquired resistance, through the activation of alternative mechanisms that sustain tumor vascularization and growth. Mechanisms of resistance are categorized into VEGF-dependent alterations, non-VEGF pathways and stromal cell interactions. Thus, complementary approaches such as the combination of these inhibitors with agents targeting alternative mechanisms of blood vessel formation are urgently needed. This review provides an updated overview on the pathophysiology of angiogenesis during tumor growth. It also sheds light on the different pro-angiogenic and anti-angiogenic agents that have been developed to date.

Analysis of CRC cases from the TCGA database suggested that this amplicon is associated with more advanced stages. We confirmed that this 13q12.2 amplicon frequently emerges later during the clinical course of disease. After defining the minimally amplified region, we observed that the amplification and expression of one gene, POLR1D, impacted cell proliferation and resulted in upregulation of VEGFA, an important regulator of angiogenesis which has been implicated in the resistance to bevacizumab treatment. In fact, in several patients, we observed the emergence of this 13q12.2 amplicon under bevacizumab treatment, which was invariably associated with therapy resistance.\nCONCLUSIONS: Non-invasive analyses of cell-free DNA from patients undergoing treatment with bevacizumab enabled the tracking of evolving tumor genomes and helped identify a recurrent focal SCNA of clinical relevance. Here, we describe a novel resistance mechanism against a widely applied treatment in patients with mCRC which will impact the clinical management of patients.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19707427": "Colorectal cancer is the second most common cause of cancer related deaths in the United States. Recent developments have led to prolonged survival with the use of sequential lines of chemotherapy agents. The addition of bevacizumab to active chemotherapy has further improved survival when used in the first and second lines of therapy for metastatic colorectal cancer. Evidence supporting the continued use of bevacizumab throughout lines of therapy is accumulating. Clinical trials are underway in which bevacizumab is continued beyond the first line of a chemotherapy and bevacizumab combination regimen. The mechanism by which colorectal cancer may become resistant to bevacizumab is poorly understood.

Studies on patients with early-stage oral cancer have shown that they develop locally recurring and/or regional lymph node metastasis, which results in disease-associated mortality. Thus, early-stage oral cancer does not always present good prognoses. The present study aimed to determine the efficacy of using worst pattern of invasion (WPOI) and other histopathological features, such as prognostic factors in OCSCC, and analyze the impact of resection margin status and histopathological prognostic indicators on local recurrence (LR) and overall survival (OS) in patients with OCSCC. A retrospective cohort study was conducted by reviewing the charts of 63 patients with OCSCC treated with primary surgery at King Abdulaziz University Hospital between 2012 and 2019. An author and an experienced pathologist reviewed pathology slides. Associations of histopathological factors, including differentiation, stage, lymphovascular invasion, extracapsular extension, perineural invasion (PNI), WPOI and surgical margins, with LR or disease-free survival (DFS) were evaluated. Univariate analysis identified WPOI and PNI, and multivariate analysis identified the WPOI as predictive factors for LR and DFS. Kaplan-Meier analysis identified the WPOI and PNI as predictive factors for OS and WPOI as a predictive factor for DFS. Therefore, it may be concluded that WPOI and PNI are significant independent prognostic factors for local tumor control and DFS in patients with OCSCC.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37294162": "Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is amongst the most common cancers, with more than 377,000 new cases worldwide each year. OSCC prognosis remains poor, related to cancer presentation at a late stage, indicating the need for early detection to improve patient prognosis. OSCC is often preceded by a premalignant state known as oral epithelial dysplasia (OED), which is diagnosed and graded using subjective histological criteria leading to variability and prognostic unreliability. In this work, we propose a deep learning approach for the development of prognostic models for malignant transformation and their association with clinical outcomes in histology whole slide images (WSIs) of OED tissue sections. We train a weakly supervised method on OED cases (n\u2009=\u2009137) with malignant transformation (n\u2009=\u200950) and mean malignant transformation time of 6.51\u2009years (\u00b15.35 SD). Stratified five-fold cross-validation achieved an average area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.78 for predicting malignant transformation in OED. Hotspot analysis revealed various features of nuclei in the epithelium and peri-epithelial tissue to be significant prognostic factors for malignant transformation, including the count of peri-epithelial lymphocytes (PELs) (p\u2009<\u20090.05), epithelial layer nuclei count (NC) (p\u2009<\u20090.05), and basal layer NC (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Progression-free survival (PFS) using the epithelial layer NC (p\u2009<\u20090.05, C-index\u2009=\u20090.73), basal layer NC (p\u2009<\u20090.05, C-index\u2009=\u20090.70), and PELs count (p\u2009<\u20090.05, C-index\u2009=\u20090.73) all showed association of these features with a high risk of malignant transformation in our univariate analysis. Our work shows the application of deep learning for the prognostication and prediction of PFS of OED for the first time and offers potential to aid patient management.

This is a retrospective review and analysis of treatment, follow-up and survival records of 249 OSCC patients treated in our department from April 2010 to April 2014. Telephonic interviews were conducted for survival details for some patients who had not reported. Survival analysis was done using the Kaplan-Meier analysis, comparisons were done using log-rank test and multivariate analysis was conducted using the Cox proportional hazard model to find different variables (site, age, sex, stage and treatment) affecting overall survival (OS)/disease-free survival (DFS). Two-year and 5-year DFS for OSCC were observed to be 72.3% and 58.3% with mean survival of 63.17\u00a0months (95% CI: 58.342-68.002).

In this study, we described an OSCC diagnosed early, highlighting how the early surgical excision prevents the morbidity.\nCASE REPORT: A 74-year-old man presented a whitish and symptomatic plaque and a discreet ulcerated area on the right lateral border of the tongue. Due to close contact with the second inferior molar, a clinical diagnosis of a frictional keratosis was suspected, however as the lesion persisted after two weeks of follow-up, an incisional biopsy was performed and the microscopic features revealed an OSCC. Early surgical resection was performed, preventing the morbidity and improve benefits to patient.\nCONCLUSION: OSCC can manifest of several clinical forms, including indolent appearances, which can delay the diagnosis, and consequently the prognosis.

However, early T-stage OSCC still exhibits substantial nodal metastasis and death rates. Recent literature highlights the independent prognostic value of worst pattern of invasion (WPOI) and tumor budding in OSCC. Nevertheless, WPOI-5 is uncommon in early T-stage OSCC, and the definitions of tumor budding and WPOI-4 overlap. Moreover, WPOI assessment is subjective, and tumor budding evaluation varies across studies. To address these limitations, we aimed to develop a modified WPOI system and a novel tumor budding scoring system that assesses single cells and high-density tumor budding. We also evaluated a new histopathologic risk model for early T-stage OSCC. The study cohort comprised 37 pT1 and 64 pT2 OSCCs. The modified WPOI demonstrated superior interobserver agreement compared with the original system (\u03ba value: 0.98 vs. 0.53). In the multivariate analysis, modified WPOI and tumor budding score were independent prognostic factors for nodal metastasis and disease-free survival, while modified WPOI predicted disease-specific survival. By integrating these factors, our risk model stratified the patients into 3 groups. Notably, the intermediate-risk and high-risk groups exhibited significantly higher rates of nodal metastasis, recurrence, and tumor-related death. Conversely, none in the low-risk group had nodal metastasis or succumbed to the disease. Our model offered simplified scoring and potentially improved prognostic predictions. In conclusion, we've developed a modified WPOI system, a new tumor budding scoring system, and a reliable risk model that classifies early T-stage OSCC patients into distinct risk groups with significant prognostic differences.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32760792": "Cesarean section is the most common surgery in obstetrics. Several techniques are proposed according to the indication and the degree of urgency. Usually laparotomy followed by hysterotomy with a low transverse incision is preferable. However, in cases in which it is difficult to access the lower uterine segment, such as that in preterm labor, dense adhesion, placenta previa/accrete a vertical hysterotomy (classical cesarean section) may be needed. Although a smooth and gentle delivery of the fetus is possible through the vertical incision, uterine closure is technically difficult. To decrease the risks of hemorrhage and adhesion, a speedy and skillful technique is mandatory. The most serious risk of vertical incision in the contractile corpus is uterine rupture in the subsequent pregnancy. Therefore, cases of prior classical cesarean section are contraindicated for trial of labor after cesarean section.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3497629": "Eleven of the 3,420 Caesarean sections performed in Westmead Hospital, Sydney during a 6-year period from 1979 to 1985 were by a low vertical uterine incision.

There are indications when the preferred lower segment Caesarean section with a transverse incision should be avoided in the interest of the mother and baby. A low vertical incision has more advantages and less dangers than a classical fundal incision. It is prudent to defer the decision regarding the type of incision until the uterus is inspected intraoperatively. If access to the lower uterine segment is limited by prematurity, an obstructing lesion, a transverse lie, or if the presenting part is high and difficulty in delivering the baby is anticipated, a low vertical incision should be considered.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34874265": "Understanding how enhancers drive cell-type specificity and efficiently identifying them is essential for the development of innovative therapeutic strategies. In melanoma, the melanocytic (MEL) and the mesenchymal-like (MES) states present themselves with different responses to therapy, making the identification of specific enhancers highly relevant. Using massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) in a panel of patient-derived melanoma lines (MM lines), we set to identify and decipher melanoma enhancers by first focusing on regions with state-specific H3K27 acetylation close to differentially expressed genes. An in-depth evaluation of those regions was then pursued by investigating the activity of overlapping ATAC-seq peaks along with a full tiling of the acetylated regions with 190 bp sequences. Activity was observed in more than 60% of the selected regions, and we were able to precisely locate the active enhancers within ATAC-seq peaks. Comparison of sequence content with activity, using the deep learning model DeepMEL2, revealed that AP-1 alone is responsible for the MES enhancer activity. In contrast, SOX10 and MITF both influence MEL enhancer function with SOX10 being required to achieve high levels of activity. Overall, our MPRAs shed light on the relationship between long and short sequences in terms of their sequence content, enhancer activity, and specificity across melanoma cell states.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32753671": "Melanoma cells can switch between a melanocytic and a mesenchymal-like state.

Although each culture exhibited a unique transcriptome, we identified shared GRNs that underlie the extreme melanocytic and mesenchymal states and the intermediate state. This intermediate state is corroborated by a distinct chromatin landscape and is governed by the transcription factors SOX6, NFATC2, EGR3, ELF1 and ETV4. Single-cell migration assays confirmed the intermediate migratory phenotype of this state. Using time-series sampling of single cells after knockdown of SOX10, we unravelled the sequential and recurrent arrangement of GRNs during phenotype switching.

Two predicted probability scores for the presence of bacterial and viral infection were calculated using the IMX-BVN-2 neural network classifier, which was trained on an independent development set. The IMX-BVN-2 bacterial score showed an area under the receiver operating curve for adjudicated bacterial versus ruled out bacterial infection of 0.90 (95% CI, 0.85-0.95) compared with 0.89 (95% CI, 0.84-0.94) for procalcitonin with procalcitonin being used in the adjudication.

Each group was classified after microbiological investigation as having definite bacterial infection, definite viral infection, or indeterminate infection. RNA expression signatures distinguishing definite bacterial from viral infection were identified in the discovery group and diagnostic performance assessed in the validation group. Additional validation was undertaken in separate studies of children with meningococcal disease (n\u2009=\u200924) and inflammatory diseases (n\u2009=\u200948) and on published gene expression datasets.\nEXPOSURES: A 2-transcript RNA expression signature distinguishing bacterial infection from viral infection was evaluated against clinical and microbiological diagnosis.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Definite bacterial and viral infection was confirmed by culture or molecular detection of the pathogens. Performance of the RNA signature was evaluated in the definite bacterial and viral group and in the indeterminate infection group.\nRESULTS: The discovery group of 240 children (median age, 19 months; 62% male) included 52 with definite bacterial infection, of whom 36 (69%) required intensive care, and 92 with definite viral infection, of whom 32 (35%) required intensive care.

Novel diagnostics based on differential host gene expression patterns are promising but have not been translated to a clinical platform nor extensively tested.

Reference standard was an adjudicated diagnosis of bacterial infection, viral infection, both, or neither. An 87-transcript signature for distinguishing bacterial, viral, and noninfectious illness was measured from peripheral blood using RT-PCR. Performance characteristics were evaluated in subjects with confirmed bacterial, viral, or noninfectious illness. Subjects with bacterial-viral coinfection and microbiologically-negative suspected bacterial infection were also evaluated. Performance was compared to procalcitonin.\nFINDINGS: 151 subjects with microbiologically confirmed, single-etiology illness were tested, yielding AUROCs 0\u202285-0\u202289 for bacterial, viral, and noninfectious illness. Accuracy was similar to procalcitonin (88% vs 83%, p\u202f=\u202f0\u202223) for bacterial vs. non-bacterial infection. Whereas procalcitonin cannot distinguish viral from non-infectious illness, the RT-PCR test had 81% accuracy in making this determination. Bacterial-viral coinfection was subdivided. Among 19 subjects with bacterial superinfection, the RT-PCR test identified 95% as bacterial, compared to 68% with procalcitonin (p\u202f=\u202f0\u202213). Among 12 subjects with bacterial infection superimposed on chronic viral infection, the RT-PCR test identified 83% as bacterial, identical to procalcitonin. 39 subjects had suspected bacterial infection; the RT-PCR test identified bacterial infection more frequently than procalcitonin (82% vs 64%, p\u202f=\u202f0\u202202).\nINTERPRETATION: The RT-PCR test offered similar diagnostic performance to procalcitonin in some subgroups but offered better discrimination in others such as viral vs. non-infectious illness and bacterial/viral coinfection.

Despite absence of bacterial infection, many febrile children are treated with antibiotics. Virus and bacteria interact with different pattern recognition receptors in circulating blood leukocytes, triggering specific host transcriptional programs mediating immune response. Therefore, unique transcriptional signatures may be defined that discriminate viral from bacterial causes of fever without an apparent source. Gene expression microarray analyses were conducted on blood samples from 30 febrile children positive for adenovirus, human herpesvirus 6, or enterovirus infection or with acute bacterial infection and 22 afebrile controls. Blood leukocyte transcriptional profiles clearly distinguished virus-positive febrile children from both virus-negative afebrile controls and afebrile children with the same viruses present in the febrile children. Virus-specific gene expression profiles could be defined. The IFN signaling pathway was uniquely activated in febrile children with viral infection, whereas the integrin signaling pathway was uniquely activated in children with bacterial infection. Transcriptional profiles classified febrile children with viral or bacterial infection with better accuracy than white blood cell count in the blood. Similarly accurate classification was shown with data from an independent study using different microarray platforms.

CapeOx (capecitabine plus oxaliplatin), in which the dose of oxaliplatin is 130 mg/m(2), has also been infused over 120 min. Maintenance of a prolonged infusion time has been largely based on the concern for a potential hypersensitivity reaction (HSR) if administered too quickly.\nMETHODS: We first performed a retrospective review of our institutional experience to assess whether HSR rates were similar in FOLFOX and CapeOx by using computerized pharmacy records between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2013. We then instituted a new policy to infuse all nonresearch doses of oxaliplatin at a set rate of 1 mg/m(2)/min (85 mg/m(2) given over 85 min; 68 mg/m(2) over 68 min, etc).

We evaluated the safety outcomes of rapid administration of oxaliplatin compared to standard infusion.\nMETHODS: We performed a retrospective, cohort study by chart review. Adult patients who received oxaliplatin as part of a FOLFOX, FOLFOXIRI, or FOLRINOX chemotherapy regimen from January 1, 2018, through June 30, 2021, were included. Primary outcomes were the incidence of hypersensitivity reaction (HSR) and treatment modification of oxaliplatin due to adverse drug events. Secondary outcomes included peripheral neuropathy (PN), myelosuppressive signs, and oxaliplatin-related emergency department visit and/or hospital admission.\nRESULTS: A total of 178 patients were included (90 and 88 in the rapid-rate and standard-rate groups, respectively). Rapid-rate oxaliplatin was not associated with increased HSR or difference in toxicity requiring dose reduction, delayed dose, or slowed infusion rate, but was associated with increased rate of permanent discontinuation of oxaliplatin, 7.8% and 1.1% in the rapid-rate group and standard-rate groups, respectively (p\u2009=\u20090.032). Peripheral neuropathy occurred in 72.2% and 42% of patients in the rapid-rate group and standard-rate groups, respectively (relative risk for PN, 2.09; 95%, CI: 1.43-3.04; p\u2009&lt;\u2009.001). There were no differences in any other adverse drug event measured.\nCONCLUSION: Rapid-rate oxaliplatin was associated with minimal treatment modifications; however, there was an increase in PN incidence. A faster rate of oxaliplatin administration may not be worth the increased risk of PN.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19622596": "BACKGROUND: Chronotherapy is one of the several approaches to increase efficacy and reduce toxicity of chemotherapy. In a phase II study in the second-line in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), we found that chronomodulated XELOX (XELOX(30Chron)) was a well-tolerated regimen with potentially reduced toxicity.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred and forty-one patients with unresectable mCRC were enrolled in a randomized study comparing standard XELOX (XELOX(30)), arm A, and XELOX(30Chron), arm B-both with short-time infusion of oxaliplatin-with the primary aim of reducing overall toxicity.\nRESULTS: Overall toxicity grade 2-4 was 90% versus 85%, P = 0.47 and grade 3-4 was 31% versus 37%, P = 0.6 in arm A and B, respectively. We found no significant differences in median overall survival (17.6 versus 15.5 months; P = 0.068) and median progression-free survival (8.9 versus 8.8 months; P = 0.7). The incidence of grade 3 neuropathy was 16% in arm A and 19% in arm B (P = 0.7) after a cumulative dose of oxaliplatin of 1000 mg/m(2).\nCONCLUSION: XELOX(30Chron) does not reduce toxicity or improve efficacy.

If cisplatin is substituted by oxaliplatin and 5-FU by capecitabine this regimen can be administered in the outpatient setting. Dose-limiting toxicity of oxaliplatin is peripheral sensory neuropathy and it is recommended to give oxaliplatin as a 120 min infusion. However, in patients with colorectal cancer a 30 min infusion of oxaliplatin can safely be administered without increasing neurotoxicity, standard infusion time is 30 min at our departments. In our phase I study the recommended doses of EXE was established (Dupont et al, 2006). Patients with non-resectable gastric adenocarcinoma were eligible. Patients received EXE (epirubicin 50 mg m(-2) day 1; capecitabine 1000 mg m(-2) day(-1) continuously and oxaliplatin 130 mg m(-2) day 1) as outpatient therapy every third week for a maximum of 8 cycles.

Clinical, imaging details and surgical findings were noted. Clinical outcomes and functional status were evaluated.\nRESULTS: During the study period, 17 patients underwent corpus callosotomy (Male: Female 14:3). The mean age at surgery was 10.3\u00a0years (standard deviation\u00a0-\u00a05.85, interquartile range [IQR]\u00a0=\u00a06.5). The mean age at onset of seizure was 2.23\u00a0years (standard deviation\u00a0-\u00a03.42, IQR\u00a0=\u00a01.5). Preoperative seizure frequency ranged from 2 to 60 attacks per day (median: 20, IQR=\u00a036). All patients had atonic seizures/drop attacks. One patient underwent anterior CC and 16 underwent complete CC. Three patients had complications in the postoperative period. The median follow-up was 26\u00a0months. All patients had cessation of drop attacks immediately following surgery. One patient with anterior CC had a recurrence of drop attacks for which she underwent completion CC. Another patient had recurrent drop attacks 3\u00a0years later and was found to have a residual callosal connection. Three patients had complete seizure freedom and 4 patients had a <50% reduction in seizure frequency.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our study lends additional support to the efficacy of CC in patients with DRE, with the cessation of drop attacks.

Anterior commissurotomy (AC) has been historically performed with CC. However, the efficacy and safety of adding AC to CC remain unknown.\nOBJECTIVE: To describe the surgical technique of extraventricular AC and retrospectively investigate its clinical efficacy and safety by assessing patients who underwent CC with and without AC.\nMETHODS: AC has been added to CC at our institution since 2018. Fifty-five consecutive patients who received total callosotomy from 2016 to 2020 were included and categorized into 2 groups: 26 patients with additional AC and 29 patients without additional AC.

The perioperative factors were compared for assessing the safety and feasibility.\nRESULTS: Seizure reduction rate (50% and 60%; P = .60) and disappearance of drop attacks (42% and 58%; P = .25) were not significantly different between CC and CC + AC groups. No statistical group differences were found in intraoperative estimated blood loss, number of days to first oral intake, duration of postoperative intravenous hydration, and length of hospital stay.\nCONCLUSION: Disconnection of the anterior commissure is a feasible and relatively safe procedure.

LITT works by heating a stereotactically placed laser fiber to ablative temperatures under real-time magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) thermometry. This study aims to (1) describe the surgical outcomes of CC in a large cohort of children with medically refractory epilepsy, (2) compare anterior and complete CC, and (3) review LITT as a surgical alternative to open craniotomy for CC.\nMETHODS: This retrospective cohort study included 103 patients <21\u2009years of age with at least 1\u2009year follow-up at a single institution between 2003 and 2021. Surgical outcomes and the comparative effectiveness of anterior vs complete and open versus LITT surgical approaches were assessed.\nRESULTS: CC was the most common surgical disconnection (65%, n\u2009=\u200967) followed by anterior two-thirds (35%, n\u2009=\u200936), with a portion proceeding to posterior completion (28%, n\u2009=\u200910). The overall surgical complication rate was 6% (n\u2009=\u20096/103). Open craniotomy was the most common approach (87%, n\u2009=\u200990), with LITT used increasingly in recent years (13%, n\u2009=\u200913). Compared to open, LITT had shorter hospital stay (3\u2009days [interquartile range (IQR) 2-5] vs 5\u2009days [IQR 3-7]; p\u2009<\u2009.05). Modified Engel class I, II, III, and IV outcomes at last follow-up were 19.8% (n\u2009=\u200917/86), 19.8% (n\u2009=\u200917/86), 40.2% (n\u2009=\u200935/86), and 19.8% (n\u2009=\u200917/86). Of the 70 patients with preoperative drop seizures, 75% resolved postoperatively (n\u2009=\u200952/69).\nSIGNIFICANCE: No significant differences in seizure outcome between patients who underwent only anterior CC and complete CC were observed.

The extent of callosotomy and the benefits of adding anterior and posterior commissurotomy are debated.\nOBJECTIVE: To describe a new technique of a purely endoscopic procedure to disconnect the corpus callosum, the anterior, posterior, and habenular commissures through the use of a single burr hole via a transfrontal transventricular route.\nMETHODS: Our surgical series was retrospectively reviewed in terms of seizure control (Engel's class) and complication rate. Five cadaveric specimens were used to demonstrate the surgical anatomy of commissural fibers and third ventricle.\nRESULTS: The procedure may be divided into 3 steps: (1) endoscopic transventricular transforaminal anterior commissure disconnection; (2) disconnection of posterior and habenular commissures; and (3) total callosotomy. Fifty-seven patients were included in the analysis. A favorable outcome in terms of epilepsy control (Engel class 1 to 3) was found in 71.4% of patients undergoing callosotomy coupled with anterior, posterior, and habenular commissure disconnection against 53% of patients with isolated callosotomy (P\u00a0=\u00a0.26). Patients with drop attacks had better epilepsy outcome independently from the surgical procedure used.\nCONCLUSION: The full endoscopic callosotomy coupled with disconnection of anterior, posterior and habenular commissures is a safe alternative to treat multifocal refractory epilepsy. A gain in seizure outcome might be present in this cohort of patients treated with total interhemispheric disconnection when compared with isolated callosotomy.

Intraoperative determination of the extent of callosotomy, the need to stage the procedure, and the side of the interhemispheric approach represent technical issues that remain debatable. The authors report the 12-year experience of the senior author as well as surgical outcomes with corpus callosotomy using a frameless stereotactic neuronavigation system (ISG View Wand and BrainLab).\nMETHODS: Thirteen consecutive children at The Hospital for Sick Children underwent single-stage corpus callosotomy for medically intractable seizures. The mean age was 10.3 years. Five children underwent partial callosotomy, and 8 underwent complete callosotomy. The side of operative approach to avoid large parasagittal bridging veins was determined by preoperative study of 3D MR imaging/MR venography reconstructed by the neuronavigation system. The extent of callosotomy was determined using intraoperative feedback from the neuronavigation system and postoperative MR imaging.\nRESULTS: The extent of callosotomy determined by intraoperative neuronavigation and postoperative MR imaging correlated closely in all cases. There were no operative deaths. There was no significant postoperative morbidity related to venous infarction. Four of 5 patients in the partial callosotomy cohort and 7 of 8 patients in the complete callosotomy cohort showed significant improvement in seizure control.\nCONCLUSIONS: The use of frameless stereotactic neuronavigation is a safe, effective, and important surgical adjunct in the planning and execution of successful corpus callosotomy in children with intractable epilepsy.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36690159": "With the explosive emergence of Zika virus (ZIKV) and the consequent devastating fetal malformations in infected expectant women, a safe and effective vaccine is urgently needed.

NS1 deletion of ZIKV-\u0394NS1 was stably maintained as no replicative virus was found in na\u00efve BHK-21\u00a0cells after continuous passaging of ZIKV-\u0394NS1 in BHK<sub>NS1</sub> cells. The safety of ZIKV-\u0394NS1 was demonstrated when a high dose of ZIKV-\u0394NS1 (107 IU) was used to infect the highly susceptible type I and type II interferon (IFN) receptor-deficient mice. ZIKV-\u0394NS1 could induce antibody responses in both immunocompetent (BALB/c) and immunodeficient mice and a single dose of ZIKV-\u0394NS1 vaccine protected the immunodeficient mice from a highly lethal dosage of challenge with WT ZIKV.

We used the envelope dimer epitope (EDE), which induces neutralizing antibodies that do not elicit ADE, to design a vaccine against both flaviviruses. However, EDE is a discontinuous quaternary epitope that cannot be isolated from the E protein without other epitopes. Utilizing phage display, we selected three peptides that mimic the EDE. Free mimotopes were disordered and did not elicit an immune response. After their display on adeno-associated virus (AAV) capsids (VLP), they recovered their structure and were recognized by an EDE-specific antibody. Characterization by cryo-EM and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay confirmed the correct display of a mimotope on the surface of the AAV VLP and its recognition by the specific antibody.

Using capped nascent RNA sequencing (PRO-cap) dataset in human lymphoblastoid cell lines across individuals, we identified inter-individual variation of expression in over 80 thousand transcribed transcriptional regulatory elements (tTREs), in both enhancers and promoters. Co-expression analysis of eRNAs from tTREs across individuals revealed how enhancers interact with each other and with promoters. Mid-to-long range interactions showed distance-dependent decay, which was modified by TF occupancy. In particular, we found a class of 'bivalent' TFs, including Cohesin, which both facilitates and insulates the interaction between enhancers and/or promoters depending on the topology. In short ranges, we observed strand specific interactions between nearby eRNAs in both convergent or divergent orientations. Our finding supports a cooperative convergent eRNA model, which is compatible with eRNA remodeling neighboring enhancers rather than interfering with each other.

Over the last decade, the transcription of enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) - nascent RNAs transcribed from active enhancers - has emerged as a key factor regulating enhancer activity. eRNAs are relatively short-lived RNA species that are transcribed at very high rates but also quickly degraded. Nevertheless, eRNAs are deeply intertwined within enhancer regulatory networks and are implicated in a number of transcriptional control mechanisms. Enhancers show changes in function and sequence over evolutionary time, raising questions about the relationship between enhancer sequences and eRNA function. Moreover, the vast majority of single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with human complex diseases map to the non-coding genome, with causal disease variants enriched within enhancers. In this Primer, we survey the diverse roles played by eRNAs in enhancer-dependent gene expression, evaluating different models for eRNA function.

Here, we identified a catalogue of eRNAs in a broad range of human cell/tissue types and extended our understanding of eRNAs by demonstrating their multi-omic signatures. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis revealed that eRNAs play key roles in human cell identity. Furthermore, we detected numerous known and novel functional RNA structures within eRNA regions.

Of note, the binding free energy calculations and MD simulation studies emphasized the greater binding affinity and structural stability of the hit compounds towards the mIDH1 protein.\nCONCLUSION: The collective evidence from our study indicates the activity of DB12001 against recurrent glioblastoma, which, in turn, highlights the accuracy of our adapted strategy. Hence, we hypothesize that the identified lead molecules could be translated for the development of mIDH1 inhibitors in the near future.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36453510": "BACKGROUND: Heterozygous mutations in the cytoplasmic and mitochondrial isoforms of isocitrate dehydrogenase enzymes 1 and 2 subtypes have been extensively exploited as viable druggable targets, as they decrease the affinity of isocitrate and higher affinity of D-2-hydroxyglutarate, an oncometabolite.\nOBJECTIVE: Vorasidenib (AG-881) has recently been reported as a promising dual inhibitor of mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 with the ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier towards the treatment of low-grade glioma. In order to combat drug resistance and toxicity levels, this compelled us to further investigate this substance as a basis for the creation of potential selective inhibitors of mutant isocitrate dehydrogenases 1 and 2.\nMETHODS: By employing a wide range of computational techniques, binding moieties of AG-881 that contributed towards its selective binding to isocitrate dehydrogenase enzymes 1 and 2 were identified and subsequently used to generate pharmacophore models for the screening of potential inhibitor drugs that were further assessed by their pharmacokinetics and physicochemical properties.\nRESULTS: AG-881 was identified as the most favorable candidate for isocitrate dehydrogenase enzyme 1, exhibiting a binding free energy of -28.69 kcal/mol. ZINC93978407 was the most favorable candidatefor isocitrate dehydrogenase enzyme 2, displaying a strong binding free energy of -27.10 kcal/mol.

The primary end point was imaging-based progression-free survival according to blinded assessment by an independent review committee. The key secondary end point was the time to the next anticancer intervention. Crossover to vorasidenib from placebo was permitted on confirmation of imaging-based disease progression.

Colorectal cancer is most frequently diagnosed among persons aged 65 to 74 years. It is estimated that 10.5% of new colorectal cancer cases occur in persons younger than 50 years. Incidence of colorectal cancer (specifically adenocarcinoma) in adults aged 40 to 49 years has increased by almost 15% from 2000-2002 to 2014-2016. In 2016, 26% of eligible adults in the US had never been screened for colorectal cancer and in 2018, 31% were not up to date with screening.\nOBJECTIVE: To update its 2016 recommendation, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) commissioned a systematic review to evaluate the benefits and harms of screening for colorectal cancer in adults 40 years or older. The review also examined whether these findings varied by age, sex, or race/ethnicity. In addition, as in 2016, the USPSTF commissioned a report from the Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network Colorectal Cancer Working Group to provide information from comparative modeling on how estimated life-years gained, colorectal cancer cases averted, and colorectal cancer deaths averted vary by different starting and stopping ages for various screening strategies.\nPOPULATION: Asymptomatic adults 45 years or older at average risk of colorectal cancer (ie, no prior diagnosis of colorectal cancer, adenomatous polyps, or inflammatory bowel disease; no personal diagnosis or family history of known genetic disorders that predispose them to a high lifetime risk of colorectal cancer [such as Lynch syndrome or familial adenomatous polyposis]).\nEVIDENCE ASSESSMENT: The USPSTF concludes with high certainty that screening for colorectal cancer in adults aged 50 to 75 years has substantial net benefit. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for colorectal cancer in adults aged 45 to 49 years has moderate net benefit. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for colorectal cancer in adults aged 76 to 85 years who have been previously screened has small net benefit.

In 2018, the American Cancer Society published a guideline update recommending a reduction in the colorectal cancer screening start age for average-risk individuals from 50 to 45. Implementing these recommendations would have important implications for public health. However, the approximate number of people impacted by this change, the average-risk population ages 45-49, is not well-described in the literature. Here, we provide methodology to conservatively estimate the average-risk and screening-eligible population in the United States, including those who would be impacted by a lowered colorectal cancer screening start age. Using multiple data sources, we estimated the current average-risk population by subtracting individuals with symptomatic colorectal cancer, with a family history of colorectal cancer, and with inflammatory bowel disease and hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer from the total population. Within this population, we estimated the number of screening-eligible individuals by subtracting those with previous colorectal cancer screening (45- to 49-year-old) or up to date with colorectal cancer screening (50- to 74-year-old). The total average-risk population is estimated between 102.1 and 106.5 million people, of whom 43.4-45.2 million people are eligible for colorectal cancer screening. Lowering the screening age would add roughly 19 million people to the average-risk population and increase the current number of screening-eligible individuals on immediate implementation by over 60% (from 27 to 44 million).

Among 425 colonoscopists, a total 263 colonoscopists replied (response rate, 61.9%).\nRESULTS: The most commonly recommended starting age for colorectal cancer screening and polyp diagnosis was 50 years old in the average risk group, and 40 years old in groups who had a family history of colon cancer (64.3% and 65.0% respectively). Surgeons had a tendency to recommend screening in younger people than internist do. Ninety-eight percent of physicians recommended screening colonoscopy to asymptomatic, average-risk patients as a first choice. Only 2% of physicians chose sigmoidoscopy as a screening tool.

Nevertheless, little is known about the dynamics and the potential roles of these marks during vertebrate embryogenesis.

We show that gene-expression differences between forelimb and hindlimb, and between limb and other embryonic cell types, are correlated with tissue-specific H3K27ac signatures at promoters and distal sites. Using H3K27ac profiles, we identified 28,377 putative enhancers, many of which are likely to be limb specific based on strong enrichment near genes highly expressed in the limb and comparisons with tissue-specific EP300 sites and known enhancers. We describe a chromatin state signature associated with active developmental enhancers, defined by high levels of H3K27ac marking, nucleosome displacement, hypersensitivity to sonication, and strong depletion of H3K27me3.

However, identification of genomic sequences that control human embryonic development represents a formidable challenge. Here we show that in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), unique chromatin signatures identify two distinct classes of genomic elements, both of which are marked by the presence of chromatin regulators p300 and BRG1, monomethylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me1), and low nucleosomal density. In addition, elements of the first class are distinguished by the acetylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27ac), overlap with previously characterized hESC enhancers, and are located proximally to genes expressed in hESCs and the epiblast. In contrast, elements of the second class, which we term 'poised enhancers', are distinguished by the absence of H3K27ac, enrichment of histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), and are linked to genes inactive in hESCs and instead are involved in orchestrating early steps in embryogenesis, such as gastrulation, mesoderm formation and neurulation. Consistent with the poised identity, during differentiation of hESCs to neuroepithelium, a neuroectoderm-specific subset of poised enhancers acquires a chromatin signature associated with active enhancers. When assayed in zebrafish embryos, poised enhancers are able to direct cell-type and stage-specific expression characteristic of their proximal developmental gene, even in the absence of sequence conservation in the fish genome. Our data demonstrate that early developmental enhancers are epigenetically pre-marked in hESCs and indicate an unappreciated role of H3K27me3 at distal regulatory elements.

We report that the 35Senh has a function to change the histone modification pattern at its presenting loci, by characterization of the 35Senh activated BREVIPEDICELLUS (BP) silencing lines and the randomly selected 35Senh activation tagging lines. By analyzing histone modification markers reflecting the plant chromatin state, we show that the 35Senh is generally correlated with the reduced level of H3K27me3 and the increased level of H3K4me3 at the insertion loci. Our data are consistent with those in mammals and suggest that the enhancer sequence correlating with the active chromatin state signature may be generally present in the eukaryotic kingdom.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33437956": "Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) is a family of multisystemic hereditary connective tissue disorders now comprised of 13 recognized subtypes, classical, classical-like, cardiac-valvular, vascular, hypermobile, arthrochlasia, dermosparaxis, kyphoscoliotic, brittle cornea syndrome, spondylodysplastic, musculocontractural, myopathic, and periodontal, as designated by the most recent 2017 International classification system.

However, because no prospective molecular studies of COL5A1 and COL5A2 have been performed in a clinically well-defined patient group, this number may underestimate the real proportion of patients with classic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome harboring a mutation in one of these genes. In the majority of patients with molecularly characterized classic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, the disease is caused by a mutation leading to a nonfunctional COL5A1 allele and resulting in haploinsufficiency of type V collagen. A smaller proportion of patients harbor a structural mutation in COL5A1 or COL5A2, causing the production of a functionally defective type V collagen protein. Most mutations identified so far result in a reduced amount of type V collagen in the connective tissues available for collagen fibrillogenesis.

This study investigated tacrolimus PK in a 2-year-old post-renal transplant patient and a known CYP3A5 expresser who developed posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) and had significantly elevated tacrolimus blood concentrations during tacrolimus treatment. A model-informed PK assessment was performed to assist with precision dosing. Tacrolimus clearance was evaluated both before and after the development of PRES on post-transplant day (PTD) 26.\nMETHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted to gather dosing data and tacrolimus concentrations, as part of a clinical pharmacology consultation service. Individual PK parameters were estimated by Bayesian estimation using a published pediatric PK model. Oral clearance (CL/F) was estimated for 3 distinct periods-before CNS symptoms (PTD 25), during the PRES event (PTD 27-30), and after oral tacrolimus was restarted (PTD 93).\nRESULTS: Bayesian estimation showed an estimated CL/F of 15.0 L/h in the days preceding the PRES event, compared with a population mean of 16.3 L/h (95% confidence interval 14.9-17.7 L/h) for CYP3A5 expressers of the same age and weight. Samples collected on PTD 27-30 yielded an estimated CL/F of 3.6 L/h, a reduction of 76%, coinciding with clinical confirmation of PRES and therapy discontinuation. On PTD 93, an additional assessment showed a stable CL/F value of 14.5 L/h 1 month after reinitiating tacrolimus and was used to recommend a continued maintenance dose.\nCONCLUSIONS: This is the first report to demonstrate acutely decreased tacrolimus clearance in PRES, likely caused by the downregulation of metabolizing enzymes in response to inflammatory cytokines.

Efficacy and safety results for the nivolumab plus ipilimumab cohort of CheckMate-142, the largest single-study report of an immunotherapy combination in dMMR/MSI-H mCRC, are reported. Patients and Methods Patients received nivolumab 3 mg/kg plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg once every 3 weeks (four doses) followed by nivolumab 3 mg/kg once every 2 weeks. Primary end point was investigator-assessed ORR. Results Of 119 patients, 76% had received \u2265 two prior systemic therapies. At median follow-up of 13.4 months, investigator-assessed ORR was 55% (95% CI, 45.2 to 63.8), and disease control rate for \u2265 12 weeks was 80%. Median duration of response was not reached; most responses (94%) were ongoing at data cutoff. Progression-free survival rates were 76% (9 months) and 71% (12 months); respective OS rates were 87% and 85%. Statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements were observed in patient-reported outcomes, including functioning, symptoms, and quality of life. Grade 3 to 4 treatment-related adverse events (AEs) occurred in 32% of patients and were manageable. Patients (13%) who discontinued treatment because of study drug-related AEs had an ORR (63%) consistent with that of the overall population.

Previous studies have shown that early-stage MSI-H colorectal cancer patients have a good prognosis, but those with advanced disease have a poor prognosis and are not sensitive to chemotherapy. The advent of PD-1 antibodies has significantly improved the prognosis and changed treatment landscape in this population, not only achieving good outcomes in late-line therapy, but also significantly outperforming traditional chemotherapy combined with targeted therapy in first-line therapy. How to overcome primary and secondary drug resistance is a key issue in improving the outcome of MSI-H metastatic colorectal cancer, and commonly used approaches include changing chemotherapy regimens, combining with other immunotherapies, combining with anti-angiogenesis, and local treatments (surgery, radiotherapy, or interventional therapy). It is worth noting that immunotherapy has certain lifelong or even lethal toxicity, and the indications for neoadjuvant immunotherapy must be evaluated with caution. Neoadjuvant immunotherapy in MSI-H advantaged population can achieve high rates of pathological complete remission (pCR) and clinical complete remission (cCR).

All patients received 6 sintilimab (Innovent, LTD) injections (200 mg/injection, every 3 weeks) before radical laparoscopic resection. The patient clinical and pathological data were analyzed retrospectively.\nRESULTS: dMMR was confirmed by immunohistochemistry for all patients. However, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or next-generation sequencing confirmed MSI-H for only 90.9% (10/11) of the patients, while 1 patient had microsatellite stable (MSS) disease. After 6 injections of neoadjuvant anti-PD-1 therapy, 90.9% (10/11) of the patients (those confirmed to have dMMR and MSI-H disease) achieved pathological complete response (pCR).

After literature review of the defining clinical, pathologic, and imaging characteristics of IBC, the experts developed a novel quantitative scoring system for diagnosis.\nRESULTS: The experts identified through consensus several \"defining characteristics\" of IBC, including factors related to timing of onset and specific symptoms. These reflect common pathophysiologic changes, sometimes detectable on biopsy in the form of dermal lymphovascular tumor emboli and often reflected in imaging findings. Based on the importance and extent of these characteristics, the experts developed a scoring scale that yields a continuous score from 0 to 48 and proposed cut-points for categorization that can be tested in subsequent validation studies.\nCONCLUSION: To move beyond subjective 'clinical diagnosis' of IBC, we propose a quantitative scoring system to define IBC, based on clinical, pathologic, and imaging features.

The most well characterized regulatory drivers are in the TERT promoter and have been identified in many cancer types. Despite the larger fraction of somatic variants occurring in non-coding regions, the number of non-coding drivers identified so far is much less than the number of coding region drivers. Here we discuss reasons that may hinder the detection of non-coding drivers. We also examine the relationship between non-coding genetic variation and epigenetic state in tumor cells and assert the need for additional epigenetic data sets as a prerequisite for understanding the rewiring of regulatory networks in cancer.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24667321": "It has been found that the majority of disease-associated genetic variants identified by genome-wide association studies are located outside of protein-coding regions, where they seem to affect regions that control transcription (promoters, enhancers) and non-coding RNAs that also can influence gene expression. In this review, we focus on two classes of non-coding RNAs that are currently a major focus of interest: micro-RNAs and long non-coding RNAs. We describe their biogenesis, suggested mechanism of action, and discuss how these non-coding RNAs might be affected by disease-associated genetic alterations. The discovery of these alterations has already contributed to a better understanding of the etiopathology of human diseases and yielded insight into the function of these non-coding RNAs. We also provide an overview of available databases, bioinformatics tools, and high-throughput techniques that can be used to study the mechanism of action of individual non-coding RNAs.

Such variants can affect phenotype by altering important regulatory elements such as promoters, enhancers or repressors, leading to changes in gene expression and consequently disease, such as thyroid cancer and allergic diseases. A number of allergy and atopy related diseases such as asthma and atopic dermatitis are related to histamine receptors; however, these diseases are not fully characterized at the molecular level. Moreover, candidate gene based studies of common variants known as single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) located in the coding regions of these receptors have given mixed results. It is important to complement these approaches by identifying and characterising non-coding variants in order to further elucidate the role of these receptors in disease. Here we present an analysis of histamine receptor genes using the tool AnNCR-SNP to characterise variants in non-coding genomic regions. AnNCR-SNP combines bioinformatics and experimental data sets from various sources to predict the effects of genetic variation on gene expression regulation. We find many SNPs located in areas of open chromatin, overlapping with transcription factor binding sites and associated with changes in gene expression in expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) experiments. Here we present the results as a catalogue of non-coding variation in histamine receptor genes to aid histamine researchers in identifying putative functional SNPs found in GWAS for further validation, and to help select variants for candidate gene studies.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35850704": "BACKGROUND: The majority of clinical genetic testing focuses almost exclusively on regions of the genome that directly encode proteins. The important role of variants in non-coding regions in penetrant disease is, however, increasingly being demonstrated, and the use of whole genome sequencing in clinical diagnostic settings is rising across a large range of genetic disorders. Despite this, there is no existing guidance on how current guidelines designed primarily for variants in protein-coding regions should be adapted for variants identified in other genomic contexts.\nMETHODS: We convened a panel of nine clinical and research scientists with wide-ranging expertise in clinical variant interpretation, with specific experience in variants within non-coding regions. This panel discussed and refined an initial draft of the guidelines which were then extensively tested and reviewed by external groups.\nRESULTS: We discuss considerations specifically for variants in non-coding regions of the genome. We outline how to define candidate regulatory elements, highlight examples of mechanisms through which non-coding region variants can lead to penetrant monogenic disease, and outline how existing guidelines can be adapted for the interpretation of\u00a0these variants.\nCONCLUSIONS: These recommendations aim to increase the number and range of non-coding region variants that can be clinically interpreted, which, together with a compatible phenotype, can lead to new diagnoses and catalyse the discovery of novel disease mechanisms.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37468838": "BACKGROUND: Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is a common monogenic multisystem disease caused primarily by mutations in the PKD1 gene or PKD2 gene.

As a result, among the 19 candidate single nucleotide alterations, 11 variants distributed in PKD1 (c.7866C\u2009>\u2009A, c.7960A\u2009>\u2009G, c.7979A\u2009>\u2009T, c.7987C\u2009>\u2009T, c.11248C\u2009>\u2009G, c.11251C\u2009>\u2009T, c.11257C\u2009>\u2009G, c.11257C\u2009>\u2009T, c.11346C\u2009>\u2009T, and c.11393C\u2009>\u2009G) and PKD2 (c.1480G\u2009>\u2009T) were identified to result in exon skipping.\nCONCLUSIONS: We confirmed that 11 variants in the gene of PKD1 and PKD2 affect normal splicing by interfering the recognition of classical splicing sites or by disrupting exon splicing enhancers and generating exon splicing silencers. This is the most comprehensive study to date on pre-mRNA splicing of exonic variants in ADPKD-associated disease-causing genes in consideration of the increasing number of identified variants in PKD1 and PKD2 gene in recent years.

Biallelic pathogenic variants in the serine/threonine kinase NEK8 cause a syndromic ciliopathy with extra-kidney manifestations. Here we identify NEK8 as a disease gene for ADPKD in 12 families. Clinical evaluation was combined with functional studies using fibroblasts and tubuloids from affected individuals. Nek8 knockout mouse kidney epithelial (IMCD3) cells transfected with wild type or variant NEK8 were further used to study ciliogenesis, ciliary trafficking, kinase function, and DNA damage responses. Twenty-one affected monoallelic individuals uniformly exhibited cystic kidney disease (mostly neonatal) without consistent extra-kidney manifestations. Recurrent de novo mutations of the NEK8 missense variant p.Arg45Trp, including mosaicism, were seen in ten families. Missense variants elsewhere within the kinase domain (p.Ile150Met and p.Lys157Gln) were also identified. Functional studies demonstrated normal localization of the NEK8 protein to the proximal cilium and no consistent cilia formation defects in patient-derived cells. NEK8-wild type protein and all variant forms of the protein expressed in Nek8 knockout IMCD3 cells were localized to cilia and supported ciliogenesis. However, Nek8 knockout IMCD3 cells expressing NEK8-p.Arg45Trp and NEK8-p.Lys157Gln showed significantly decreased polycystin-2 but normal ANKS6 localization in cilia. Moreover, p.Arg45Trp NEK8 exhibited reduced kinase activity in\u00a0vitro. In patient derived tubuloids and IMCD3 cells expressing NEK8-p.Arg45Trp, DNA damage signaling was increased compared to healthy passage-matched controls.

Zilucoplan is a subcutaneous, self-administered macrocyclic peptide complement C5 inhibitor. We aimed to assess safety, efficacy, and tolerability of zilucoplan in patients with acetylcholine receptor autoantibody (AChR)-positive generalised myasthenia gravis.\nMETHODS: RAISE was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial that was done at 75 sites in Europe, Japan, and North America. We enrolled patients (aged 18-74 years) with AChR-positive generalised myasthenia gravis (Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America disease class II-IV), a myasthenia gravis activities of daily living (MG-ADL) score of least 6, and a quantitative myasthenia gravis score of at least 12. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive subcutaneous zilucoplan 0\u00b73 mg/kg once daily by self-injection, or matched placebo, for 12 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was change from baseline to week 12 in MG-ADL score in the modified intention-to-treat population (all randomly assigned patients who received at least one dose of study drug and had at least one post-dosing MG-ADL score). Safety was mainly assessed by the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) in all patients who had received at least one dose of zilucoplan or placebo.

An open-label extension study is ongoing (NCT04225871).\nFINDINGS: Between Sept 17, 2019, and Sept 10, 2021, 239 patients were screened for the study, of whom 174 (73%) were eligible. 86 (49%) patients were randomly assigned to zilucoplan 0\u00b73 mg/kg and 88 (51%) were assigned to placebo. Patients assigned to zilucoplan showed a greater reduction in MG-ADL score from baseline to week 12, compared with those assigned to placebo (least squares mean change -4\u00b739 [95% CI -5\u00b728 to -3\u00b750] vs -2\u00b730 [-3\u00b717 to -1\u00b743]; least squares mean difference -2\u00b709 [-3\u00b724 to -0\u00b795]; p=0\u00b70004). TEAEs occurred in 66 (77%) patients in the zilucoplan group and in 62 (70%) patients in the placebo group. The most common TEAE was injection-site bruising (n=14 [16%] in the zilucoplan group and n=8 [9%] in the placebo group). Incidences of serious TEAEs and serious infections were similar in both groups. One patient died in each group; neither death (COVID-19 [zilucoplan] and cerebral haemorrhage [placebo]) was considered related to the study drug.\nINTERPRETATION: Zilucoplan treatment showed rapid and clinically meaningful improvements in myasthenia gravis-specific efficacy outcomes, had a favourable safety profile, and was well tolerated, with no major safety findings.

In the second study, 5-FU was administered as a weekly 24-h infusion for 5 weeks of a 6-week cycle and raltitrexed was given 15-min prior to 5-FU on days 8 and 29. The recommended dose for bolus 5-FU in combination with raltitrexed is likely to be 1200 mg/m2 as dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) of febrile neutropenia was observed at 1350 mg/m2, but escalation of raltitrexed above the dose used for single-agent use (3.0 mg/m2) continues. In the raltitrexed/infusional 5-FU study, dose escalation is also still continuing, but only in men as no DLT has been observed in men; 2 of 3 female patients had DLT of myelosuppression and diarrhoea at raltitrexed 3.0 mg/m2 and infusional 5-FU 2400 mg/m2. Raltitrexed had a significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of 5-FU irrespective of 5-FU regimen.

The triad of Horner's syndrome, ipsilateral ataxia, and ipsilateral hyperalgesia clinically identify patients with LMS. We report a case of a 62-year-old diabetic, hypertensive male who presented with symptoms involving the left lateral dorsal medulla along with partial Horner's syndrome, left lateral rectus palsy, and left lower motor neuron-type facial palsy. Atypical presentation in LMS could be explained by infraction of left facial colliculus in addition to the left lateral medulla.

Diagnosis of Wallenberg syndrome is often overlooked as initial MRI may show no visible lesion. We present an atypical case of Wallenberg syndrome in which the initial MRI of the brain was normal. Our patient is a 65-year-old male who was brought in by emergency medical services complaining of right-sided facial droop, slurred speech, and left-sided weakness for one day. Physical examination showed decreased left arm and leg strength compared to the right side, decreased left facial temperature sensations, decreased left arm and leg temperature sensations, and difficulty sitting upright with an associated leaning towards the left side. An initial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain with and without contrast revealed no abnormality. In light of such a high suspicion for stroke based on the patient's neurologic deficits, a repeat MRI of the brain was performed three days later and exposed a small focus of bright signal (hyperintensity) on T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in the left posterior medulla. Wallenberg syndrome, also known as lateral medullary syndrome or posterior inferior cerebellar artery\u00a0syndrome, is a constellation of symptoms caused by posterior vascular accidents. The neurological deficits associated with this disease are due to damage of the lateral medulla, inferior cerebellar peduncle, nucleus of trigeminal nerve, nucleus and fibers of vagus and glossopharyngeal nerves, descending sympathetic tract, spinothalamic tract, and/or vestibular nuclei. MRI with DWI is the gold standard to confirm the diagnosis. Wallenberg syndrome has the potential to leave patients extremely debilitated.

Many countries have instituted CF newborn screening because early diagnosis improves outcome. CF research has greatly intensified following the discovery of the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, which has more than 2000 different mutations. For patients with common mutations like F508del, CFTR modulators are life transforming and may even prevent major complications if started early in childhood.

There is currently limited evidence regarding both the global epidemiology of CF and access to this transformative therapy - and therefore where needs are not being met. Therefore, this study aims to define gaps in access to CF treatment.\nMETHODS: Patient data were extracted from established CF registries. Where these were not available, literature searches were conducted alongside an international survey of 51 CF experts to determine the diagnosed patient population. National CF prevalence estimates were combined with registry data on estimated population coverage, to extrapolate the total estimated number of undiagnosed patients. Estimates of ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor treatment coverage were extracted from publicly available sales summaries and pricing data.\nRESULTS: 162,428 [144,606-186,620] people are estimated to be living with CF across 94 countries. Of these, an estimated 105,352 (65%) are diagnosed, with 19,516 (12%) receiving triple combination therapy. We estimated 57,076 patients with undiagnosed CF. Owing to a paucity of high-quality data, estimates of undiagnosed CF in low- and middle-income countries are highly uncertain. Patient registries were available in 45 countries, and used to identify 90% of the estimated diagnosed population.\nCONCLUSIONS: A significant CF patient burden exists in countries where disease-modifying drugs are unavailable, and final figures are likely underestimates.

Since miRNAs can regulate the expression of several genes, they have multiple roles to play in biological processes and human diseases. The majority of miRNAs are known to be expressed in the brain and are involved in synaptic functions, thus marking their presence and role in major neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). In AD, amyloid beta (A\u03b2) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) are known to be the major hallmarks. The clearance of A\u03b2 and tau is known to be associated with miRNA dysregulation. In addition, the \u03b2-site APP cleaving enzyme (BACE 1), which cleaves APP to form A\u03b2, is also found to be regulated by miRNAs, thus directly affecting A\u03b2 accumulation. Growing evidences suggest that neuroinflammation can be an initial event in AD pathology, and miRNAs have been linked with the regulation of neuroinflammation. Inflammatory disorders have also been associated with AD pathology, and exosomes associated with miRNAs are known to regulate brain inflammation, suggesting for the role of systemic miRNAs in AD pathology. Several miRNAs have been related in AD, years before the clinical symptoms appear, most of which are associated with regulating the cell cycle, immune system, stress responses, cellular senescence, nerve growth factor (NGF)\u00a0signaling, and synaptic regulation. Phytochemicals, especially polyphenols, alter the expression of various miRNAs by binding to miRNAs or binding to the transcriptional activators of miRNAs, thus control/alter various metabolic pathways.

Gene regulation occurs at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. Recent studies have suggested that micro-RNA (miRNA) plays a significant role at the post-transcriptional gene regulation. miRNA are a recently identified class of RNA molecules 18-24 nucleotides in length that have been shown to negatively regulate the stability or translation of target messenger RNA. We hypothesised that ionising radiation induced stress response is controlled in part by miRNA and that a difference in tumour protein 53 (p53) status corresponds with altered expression in miRNA responses to ionising radiation.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: To test this hypothesis, we investigated the relative expression of several miRNA by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (QPCR) in human cell lines TK6 and WTK1 that differ in p53 status and radiosensitivity after exposure to high and low doses of X-radiation.\nRESULTS: The suitability of several endogenous miRNA controls was tested for relative quantification by QPCR. The baseline expression of 21 miRNA targets in TK6 and WTK1 cells indicated a wide range of modulation between the two cell lines without exposure to ionising radiation. Differences in the relative expression of miRNA were observed among the two cell lines after radiation treatment. The expression patterns of many miRNA markedly differed within the same cell line after exposure to either 0.5 Gy or 2 Gy doses of X-rays. The expression of eight miRNA belonging to the lethal-7 (let-7) family, which are negative regulators of the rat sarcoma, RAS oncogene, was upregulated in irradiated TK6 cells but was downregulated in WTK1 cells. Alterations in the myelocytomatosis oncogene, c-MYC induced cluster of miRNA were also observed. The micro RNA, miR-15a and miR-16 were upregulated in 0.5 Gy-irradiated TK6 cells but were downregulated after a 2 Gy dose of X-rays. In contrast miR-15 and miR-16 were repressed in 0.5 Gy-exposed WTK1. The miR-21 was upregulated in 0.5 Gy-treated TK6 cells and its target genes programmed cell death factor 4 (hPDCD4) phosphatase and tensin homolog (hPTEN), and sprouty homolog 2 (hSPRY2) were found to be downregulated in these cells. The miR-21 was downregulated in 2 Gy-irradiated TK6 cells, and all three of its target genes were upregulated in 2 Gy-exposed TK6 cells.\nCONCLUSION: Taken together, these results establish the involvement of miRNA in radiation response and may potentially help explain the mechanisms of gene regulation in the cellular response to ionising radiation exposure.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23447695": "Gene regulation in cells exposed to ionizing radiation (IR) occurs at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels.

Methods: Umbilical cord samples from the proband and peripheral blood samples from his parents were collected, and genomic DNA was extracted for whole-exome sequencing (WES). Bioinformatic analysis was used to identify potential genetic causes, and Sanger sequencing confirmed the existence of variants within the pedigree. A minigene assay was performed to validate the effects of an intronic variant on mRNA splicing. Results: Two variants, c.9455del (p.N3152Tfs*10) and c.2408-13C&gt;G, were identified in the PKHD1 gene (NM_138694.4) by WES; the latter has not been previously reported. In silico analysis predicted that this intronic variant is potentially pathogenic. Bioinformatic splice prediction tools revealed that the variant is likely to strongly impact splice site function. An in vitro minigene assay revealed that c.2408-13C&gt;G can cause aberrant splicing, resulting in the retention of 12 bp of intron 23. Conclusion: A novel pathogenic variant of PKHD1, c.2408-13C&gt;G, was found in a fetus with ARPKD, which enriches the variant spectrum of the PKHD1 gene and provides a basis for genetic counseling and the diagnosis of ARPKD.

We develop a PET agent, [89Zr]-DFO-DLL3-scFv, that detects DLL3 levels in mouse SCNC models. In multiple patient-derived xenograft models, AMG 757 (tarlatamab), a half-life-extended bispecific T-cell engager (BiTE) immunotherapy that redirects CD3-positive T cells to kill DLL3-expressing cells, exhibited potent and durable antitumor activity. Late relapsing tumors after AMG 757 treatment exhibited lower DLL3 levels, suggesting antigen loss as a resistance mechanism, particularly in tumors with heterogeneous DLL3 expression. These findings have been translated into an ongoing clinical trial of AMG 757 in de novo and t-SCNC, with a confirmed objective partial response in a patient with histologically confirmed SCNC. Overall, these results identify DLL3 as a therapeutic target in SCNC and demonstrate that DLL3-targeted BiTE immunotherapy has significant antitumor activity in this aggressive prostate cancer subtype.\nSIGNIFICANCE: The preclinical and clinical evaluation of DLL3-directed immunotherapy, AMG 757, and development of a PET radiotracer for noninvasive DLL3 detection demonstrate the potential of targeting DLL3 in SCNC prostate cancer.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36689692": "PURPOSE: Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive malignancy with limited treatments.

Delta-like ligand 3 (DLL3), a Notch inhibitory ligand, is an attractive therapeutic target because it is overexpressed on the surface of SCLC cells with minimal to no expression on normal cells.

Liquid biopsy tests are in development for cancer early detection, but it is unclear whether they are cost-effective for colorectal cancer screening.\nOBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of liquid biopsy for colorectal cancer screening in the US.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this economic evaluation, a Markov model was developed to compare no screening and 5 colorectal cancer screening strategies: colonoscopy, liquid biopsy, liquid biopsy following nonadherence to colonoscopy, stool DNA, and fecal immunochemical test. Adherence to first-line screening with colonoscopy, stool DNA, or fecal immunochemical test was assumed to be 60.6%, and adherence for liquid biopsy was assumed to be 100%. For colonoscopy, stool DNA, and fecal immunochemical test, patients who did not adhere to testing were not offered other screening. In colonoscopy-liquid biopsy hybrid, liquid biopsy was second-line screening for those who deferred colonoscopy. Scenario analyses were performed to include the possibility of polyp detection for liquid biopsy.\nEXPOSURES: No screening, colonoscopy, fecal immunochemical test, stool DNA, liquid biopsy, and colonoscopy-liquid biopsy hybrid screening.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Model outcomes included life expectancy, total cost, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. A strategy was considered cost-effective if it had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio less than the US willingness-to-pay threshold of $100\u202f000 per life-year gained.\nRESULTS: This study used a simulated cohort of patients aged 45 years with average risk of colorectal cancer. In the base case, colonoscopy was the preferred, or cost-effective, strategy with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $28\u202f071 per life-year gained. Colonoscopy-liquid biopsy hybrid had the greatest gain in life-years gained but had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $377\u202f538.

Liquid biopsies have been proposed as a novel method for the early detection of cancer, but low cell-free DNA tumor fraction might pose a problem for the use in population screening. Using breast cancer microsimulation model MISCAN-Fadia, we estimated the outcomes of using liquid biopsies in breast cancer screening in women aged 50 to 74 in the United States. For varying combinations of test sensitivity and specificity, we quantify the impact of the use of liquid biopsies on the harms and benefits of screening, and we estimate the maximum liquid biopsy price for cost-effective implementation in breast cancer screening at a cost-effectiveness threshold of USD 50,000. We investigate under what conditions liquid biopsies could be a suitable alternative to digital mammography and compare these conditions to a CCGA substudy. Outcomes were compared to digital mammography screening, and include mortality reduction, overdiagnoses, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and the maximum price of a liquid biopsy for cost-effective implementation. When liquid biopsies are unable to detect DCIS, a large proportion of overdiagnosed cases is prevented but overall breast cancer mortality reduction and quality of life are lower, and costs are higher compared to digital mammography screening. Liquid biopsies prices should be restricted to USD 187 per liquid biopsy depending on test performance. Overall, liquid biopsies that are unable to detect ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) need to be able to detect small, early-stage tumors, with high specificity, at low costs in order to be an alternative to digital mammography.

In the era of personalized medicine, tumor sampling is essential for characterizing the molecular profile of individual tumors. This provides pivotal information regarding optimal sequencing of therapy and emergence of drug resistance, allowing for timely therapy adjustment. However, tumor tissue sampling offers static information in a single time point and area of disease at the time of biopsy, which may not entirely represent the heterogeneity of molecular alterations. Moreover, tumor biopsies often involve invasive procedures with potential risks to patients. Less invasive, safer, and real-time methods such as liquid biopsies have generated increasing interest as a surrogate of solid tumor biopsies. Liquid biopsy allows for noninvasive survey with detection of cell-free circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) or circulating tumor cells. Blood-based assays are the most widely studied. Additionally, the quantity of ctDNA detected has been shown to correlate with tumor burden and enables assessment of tumor heterogeneity. In this article, we discuss the concept of liquid biopsies including ctDNA and circulating tumor cell, and their current application in the diagnosis and management of CRC. We suggest that liquid biopsies can be successfully used to characterize the molecular profile of CRC, monitor disease, detect minimal residual disease after surgery, and identify therapeutic targets and mechanisms of drug resistance.

To reliably distinguish CRC patients from healthy controls, we determined cutoffs for the detection of ctDNA based on global and regional cfDNA fragmentation patterns, transcriptionally active chromatin sites, and somatic copy number alterations. We further combined global and regional fragmentation pattern into a machine learning (ML) classifier to accurately predict ctDNA for cancer detection. By following individual patients throughout their course of disease, we show that LIFE-CNA enables the reliable prediction of response or resistance to treatment up to 3.5\u00a0months before commonly used CEA.\nCONCLUSION: In summary, we developed and validated a sensitive and cost-effective method for untargeted ctDNA detection at diagnosis as well as for treatment monitoring of all CRC patients based on genetic as well as non-genetic tumor-specific cfDNA features. Thus, once sensitivity and specificity have been externally validated, LIFE-CNA has the potential to be implemented into clinical practice.

The aim of this analysis is to determine the cost-effectiveness of population-based screening for colorectal cancer (CRC) using CTC with a polyp size threshold.\nMETHODS: The cost-effectiveness ratios of CTC performed at 50, 60 and 70 years old, without (PL strategy) or with (TS strategy) polyp size threshold were compared using a Markov process. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) were calculated per life-years gained (LYG) for a time horizon of 30 years.\nRESULTS: The ICER of PL and TS strategies were 12 042 and 2765 euro/LYG associated to CRC prevention rates of 37.9 and 36.5%. The ICER of PL and TS strategies dropped to 9687 and 1857 euro/LYG when advanced adenoma (AA) prevalence increased from 6.9 to 8.6% for male participants and 3.8-4.9% for female participants or to 9482 and 2067 euro/LYG when adenoma and AA annual recurrence rates dropped to 3.2 and 0.25%. The ICER for PL and TS strategies decreased to 7947 and 954 euro/LYG or when only two CTC were performed at 50 and 60-years-old. Conversely, the ICER did not significantly change when varying population participation rate or accuracy of CTC.\nCONCLUSION: CTC with a 6 mm threshold for polypectomy is associated to a substantial cost reduction without significant loss of efficacy. Cost-effectiveness depends more on the AA prevalence or transition rate to CRC than on CTC accuracy or screening compliance.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36566630": "Mucormycosis is a fungal infection which got worsens with time if not diagnosed and treated.

COVID-19 infection imparts in weak immune system so chances of infection is comparatively high in COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, diabetes, corticosteroid medicines, and a weakened immune system are the most prevalent risk factors for this infection as we discussed in case studies here. The steroid therapy for COVID-19 patients sometimes have negative impact on the patient health and this state encounters many infections including mucormycosis.

We present a case series of 61 patients diagnosed and treated for rhinocerebral mucormycosis (RCM) at a single tertiary health care center.\nMETHODS: After obtaining ethical clearance, all patient files with a final diagnosis of RCM were thoroughly analyzed in departmental records and a master chart was prepared. The study evaluated the etiology, clinical spectrum, diagnosis, management, complications, and outcome at 3 months of RCM cases.\nRESULTS: About 93.4% of the RCM cases were diabetic and an equal number had a past history of COVID infection. About 85.2% had received steroids for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 infection. The most common presentation of RCM was temporal lobe abscess (25.7%) followed by frontal lobe abscess (16.6%). At 3 months post-diagnosis, mortality in our study was 42.6%. About 26.2 % of the RCM cases had no disease, 23% had a static disease, and 8.2% had progressive disease at the end of 3 months.\nCONCLUSION: We report the largest single-center case series of RCM, comprising 61 patients. This case series underscores the importance of the early diagnosis and prompt treatment for a better prognosis for this dreadful disease. The three pillars of treatment for RCM cases include reversal of the immunosuppressive state, administration of antifungal drugs, and extensive surgical debridement.

Our study indicates that gene editing is more efficient in euchromatin than in heterochromatin, and we validate this finding in HeLa cells and in human fibroblasts.

In an experimental setting, we found that guide RNAs differ in their onset of mutagenesis activity in vivo. Furthermore, some guide RNAs with high in vitro activity possessed poor mutagenesis activity in vivo, suggesting the presence of factors that limit the mutagenesis in vivo. Using open access datasets generated from early developmental stages of the zebrafish, and guide RNAs selected from the CRISPRz database, we provide further evidence for an association between gene expression during early development and the success of CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis in zebrafish embryos. In order to further inspect the effect of chromatin on CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis, we analysed the relationship of selected chromatin features on CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis efficiency using publicly available data from zebrafish embryos.

While many studies consider DNA sequences of CRISPR target sites as the primary determinant for CRISPR mutagenesis efficiency and mutation profiles, increasing evidence reveals the substantial role of chromatin context. Nonetheless, most prior studies are limited by the lack of sufficient epigenetic resources and/or by only transiently expressing CRISPR-Cas9 in a short time window. In this study, we leveraged the wealth of high-resolution epigenomic resources in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) to address the impact of chromatin features on CRISPR-Cas9 mutagenesis using stable transgenic plants. Our results indicated that DNA methylation and chromatin features could lead to substantial variations in mutagenesis efficiency by up to 250-fold. Low mutagenesis efficiencies were mostly associated with repressive heterochromatic features. This repressive effect appeared to persist through cell divisions but could be alleviated through substantial reduction of DNA methylation at CRISPR target sites. Moreover, specific chromatin features, such as H3K4me1, H3.3, and H3.1, appear to be associated with significant variation in CRISPR-Cas9 mutation profiles mediated by the non-homologous end joining repair pathway.

In this review, we analyse the performance of recently described tools for CRISPR/Cas9 guide RNA design, in particular, design tools that predict CRISPR/Cas9 activity. What advances does it highlight? Recently, many tools designed to predict CRISPR/Cas9 activity have been reported. However, the majority of these tools lack experimental validation. Our analyses indicate that these tools have poor predictive power. Our preliminary results suggest that target site accessibility should be considered in order to develop better guide RNA design tools with improved predictive power. The recent adaptation of the clustered regulatory interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein\u00a09 (Cas9) system for targeted genome engineering has led to its widespread application in many fields worldwide. In order to gain a better understanding of the design rules of CRISPR/Cas9 systems, several groups have carried out large library-based screens leading to some insight into sequence preferences among highly active target sites. To facilitate CRISPR/Cas9 design, these studies have spawned a plethora of guide RNA (gRNA) design tools with algorithms based solely on direct or indirect sequence features. Here, we demonstrate that the predictive power of these tools is poor, suggesting that sequence features alone cannot accurately inform the cutting efficiency of a particular CRISPR/Cas9 gRNA design. Furthermore, we demonstrate that DNA target site accessibility influences the activity of CRISPR/Cas9. With further optimization, we hypothesize that it will be possible to increase the predictive power of gRNA design tools by including both sequence and target site accessibility metrics.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37650357": "This is the English version of the Japanese guidance for biologics in treating atopic dermatitis (AD).

Focusing on the evidence for nearly 10 years (2009-2018), basic characteristics and main results were extracted. Costs were discounted to 2017 using the consumer price index of medical and health care being provided to the residents, and the ratio of incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) to per capita GDP in corresponding years were calculated. Results: A total of 12 articles (8 new ones) were included, of which 9 were population-based (all cross-sectional studies) and 3 were model-based. Most of the initial screening age was 40 years (7 articles), and most of the frequency was once in a lifetime (11 articles). Technologies used for primary screening included: questionnaire assessment, immunological fecal occult blood test (iFOBT) and endoscopy. The most commonly used indicator was the cost per colorectal cancer detected, and the median (range) of the 20 screening schemes was 52 307 Chinese Yuan (12 967-3 769 801, n=20). The cost per adenoma detected was 9 220 Yuan (1 859-40 535, n=10).

The primary end point was completion of colorectal cancer screening tests. Sensitivity analyses investigated cost-effectiveness estimates varying the data collection methods, costs of labor and technology, and the effectiveness of the intervention.\nRESULTS: Rates of colorectal cancer screening for the intervention versus control arms were 41.3% v 32.4%, respectively (P < .05). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was dollar 978 per additional veteran screened based on feedback reports generated from manual review of records. However, if feedback reports could be generated from information technology systems, sensitivity analyses indicate that the cost-effectiveness estimate would decrease to dollar 196 per additional veteran screened.\nCONCLUSION: An intervention based on quarterly feedback reports to physicians improved colorectal cancer screening rates at a VA medical center. This intervention would be cost effective if relevant data could be generated by existing information technology systems. Our findings may have broad applicability because a 2005 Medicare initiative will provide the VA electronic medical record system as a free benefit to all US physicians.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20059779": "OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to compare the cost and the effectiveness of two biennial fecal occult blood screening tests for colorectal cancer: a guaiac nonrehydrated test (G-FOBT) and an immunochemical test (I-FOBT) with the absence of screening.\nMETHODS: A Markov model was developed to compare these strategies in a general population of subjects aged 50 to 74 over a 20-year period.\nRESULTS: Compared with the absence of screening, G-FOBT and I-FOBT were associated with a decrease in colorectal cancer mortality of 17.4 percent and 25.2 percent, respectively. With regard to cost-effectiveness, expressed as cost per life-year gained, I-FOBT was the most effective and most costly alternative. Compared with no screening, G-FOBT and I-FOBT presented similar discounted incremental cost-effectiveness ratios: 2,739 euros and 2,819 euros respectively per life-year gained. When compared with G-FOBT, I-FOBT presented an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 2,988 euros per life-year gained. Sensitivity analyses showed the strong influence of the I-FOBT lead time, of the participation rate to screening for I-FOBT, and of the purchase price of the I-FOBT on the discounted incremental cost-effectiveness ratios.\nCONCLUSIONS: Compared with the absence of screening and with G-FOBT, the biennial two-stool immunochemical test can be considered a promising method for mass screening for colorectal cancer.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36660031": "INTRODUCTION: Cri-du-chat syndrome is generally diagnosed when patients present a high-pitched cry at birth, microcephaly, ocular hypertelorism, and prominent nasal bridge. The karyotype is useful to confirm deletions in the short arm of chromosome 5 (5p-) greater than 10 Mb. In cases of smaller deletions, it is necessary to resort to other molecular techniques such as fluorescence in situ hybridization, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) or genomic array.\nCASE PRESENTATION: We report a family with an atypical deletion in 5p (mother and 2 children) and variable phenotypes compared with the literature. We applied a P064 MLPA kit to evaluate 5p- in the mother and the 2 children, and we used the Infinium CytoSNP-850K BeadChip genomic array to evaluate the siblings, an 11-year-old boy and a 13-year-old girl, to better define the 5p breakpoints. Both children presented a high-pitched cry at birth, but they did not present any of the typical physical features of 5p- syndrome. The MLPA technique with 5 probes for the 5p region revealed that the patients and their mother presented an atypical deletion with only 4 probes deleted (TERT_ex2, TERT_ex13, CLPTM1L, and IRX4). The genomic array performed in the siblings' samples revealed a 6.2-Mb terminal deletion in 5p15.33p15.32, which was likely inherited from their mother, who presented similar molecular features, seen in MLPA.\nDISCUSSION: The sparing of the CTNND2 gene, which is associated with cerebral development, in both siblings may explain why these 2 patients had features such as better communication skills which most patients with larger 5p deletions usually do not present. In addition, both patients had smaller deletions than those found in patients with a typical 5p- phenotype. This report demonstrates the utility of genomic arrays as a diagnostic tool to better characterize atypical deletions in known syndromes such as 5p- syndrome, which will allow a better understanding of the genotype-phenotype correlations.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37908952": "Cri-du-chat syndrome (CdCS) is a rare genetic disorder in which the short arm of chromosome 5 is deleted.

In addition, loss of this portion of a chromosome is a common cytogenetic marker in a number of malignancies. However, to date, no genes associated with these disorders have been identified. Physical maps are the first step in isolating causative genes, and genes involved in autosomal recessive disorders are now routinely mapped through the identification of linked markers. Extensive genetic maps based upon polymorphic short tandem repeats (STRs) have provided researchers with a large number of markers to which such disorders can be genetically mapped. However, the physical locations of many of these STRs have not been determined. Toward the goal of integrating the human genetic maps with the physical maps, a 5p somatic cell hybrid deletion mapping panel that was derived from patients with 5p deletions or translocations was used to physically map 47 STRs that have been used to construct genetic maps of 5p.

This article reviews the literature on excess early mortality in persons with schizophrenia and suggests reasons for the high mortality as well as possible ways to reduce it. Persons with schizophrenia have an exceptionally short life expectancy. High mortality is found in all age groups, resulting in a life expectancy of approximately 20 years below that of the general population. Evidence suggests that persons with schizophrenia may not have seen the same improvement in life expectancy as the general population during the past decades. Thus, the mortality gap not only persists but may actually have increased. The most urgent research agenda concerns primary candidates for modifiable risk factors contributing to this excess mortality, i.e., side effects of treatment and lifestyle factors, as well as sufficient prevention and treatment of physical comorbidity.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29723811": "INTRODUCTION: There is increasing evidence of excess mortality in schizophrenia but less information on other non-affective psychoses. We therefore generated standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) for community-dwelling people with schizophrenia and other non-affective psychoses, relative to the general population, and examined changes to the SMR over time.\nMETHODS: We conducted a systematic review in which Pubmed, CINAHL, EMBASE, Google Scholar and PsycINFO were searched for publications that reported SMRs for all-cause mortality among community-dwelling people with schizophrenia and psychotic disorders. Meta-analyses of SMRs were conducted, pooled across genders and then separately by gender. Sub-group analyses were conducted for diagnostic group, global region, decade and risk of study bias.\nRESULTS: We were able to include 34 studies covering 1,724,906 participants. The gender pooled SMR for schizophrenia and psychotic disorders was 3.08 (95%CI 2.88-3.31). Schizophrenia and broader psychotic disorders had similar SMRs. Stratification by decade of observation suggests that the difference in SMR is not declining and may possibly be widening.

We compared the agreement of validated study data on sepsis criteria with ICD-10 coding abstraction obtained at the participating hospitals.\nRESULTS: We analyzed 998 hospital admissions of children with blood culture-proven sepsis. The sensitivity of ICD-10 coding abstraction was 60% (95%-CI 57-63) for sepsis; 35% (95%-CI 31-39) for sepsis with organ dysfunction, using an explicit abstraction strategy; and 65% (95%-CI 61-69) using an implicit abstraction strategy. For septic shock, the sensitivity of ICD-10 coding abstraction was 43% (95%-CI 37-50). Agreement of ICD-10 coding abstraction with validated study data varied by the underlying infection type and disease severity (p\u2009&lt;\u20090.05).

We review IRR and subsequent management in amivantamab-treated patients.\nMETHODS: Patients treated with the approved dose of intravenous amivantamab (1050\u00a0mg, <80\u00a0kg; 1400\u00a0mg, \u226580\u00a0kg) in CHRYSALIS-an ongoing, phase 1 study in advanced EGFR-mutated NSCLC-were included in this analysis. IRR mitigations included split first dose (350\u00a0mg, day 1 [D1]; remainder, D2), reduced initial infusion rates with proactive infusion interruption, and steroid premedication before initial dose. For all doses, pre-infusion antihistamines and antipyretics were required. Steroids were optional after the initial dose.\nRESULTS: As of 3/30/2021, 380 patients received amivantamab.

Most (90%) IRRs occurred on cycle 1, D1 (C1D1); median time-to-first-IRR onset during C1D1 was 60\u00a0min; and first-infusion IRRs did not compromise subsequent infusions. Per protocol, IRR was mitigated on C1D1 with holding of infusion (56% [214/380]), reinitiating at reduced rate (53% [202/380]), and aborting infusion (14% [53/380]).

Amivantamab, an EGFR and MET bispecific antibody, demonstrated efficacy and tolerability in patients with advanced EGFR-mutated NSCLC with Exon20ins following platinum-based therapy in CHRYSALIS (NCT02609776; Cohort D+).

Elderly patients received a lower relative dose intensity of oxaliplatin (0.76 versus 0.79) and 5-fluorouracil (0.75 versus 0.80, P = 0.009).\nCONCLUSIONS: Adjuvant oxaliplatin, fluorouracil and leucovorin chemotherapy resulted in similar efficacy without significant increase in toxicity in older patients aged \u226565 when compared with younger patients with curatively resected Stage III colon cancer. Therefore, for colon cancer patients aged \u226565, oxaliplatin, fluorouracil and leucovorin chemotherapy can be recommended as safe and effective adjuvant chemotherapy after curative surgery in Asia.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37429851": "SARS-CoV-2 is a zoonotic virus with documented bi-directional transmission between people and animals. Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from humans to free-ranging white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) poses a unique public health risk due to the potential for reservoir establishment where variants may persist and evolve. We collected 8,830 respiratory samples from free-ranging white-tailed deer across Washington, D.C. and 26 states in the United States between November 2021 and April 2022. We obtained 391 sequences and identified 34 Pango lineages including the Alpha, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron variants. Evolutionary analyses showed these white-tailed deer viruses originated from at least 109 independent spillovers from humans, which resulted in 39 cases of subsequent local deer-to-deer transmission and three cases of potential spillover from white-tailed deer back to humans. Viruses repeatedly adapted to white-tailed deer with recurring amino acid substitutions across spike and other proteins. Overall, our findings suggest that multiple SARS-CoV-2 lineages were introduced, became enzootic, and co-circulated in white-tailed deer.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36710856": "Natural cases of zooanthroponotic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to animals have been reported during the COVID-19 pandemic, including to free-ranging white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in North America and farmed American mink (Neovison vison) on multiple continents. To understand the potential for angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-mediated viral tropism we characterised the distribution of ACE2 receptors in the respiratory and intestinal tissues of a selection of wild and semi-domesticated mammals including artiodactyls (cervids, bovids, camelids, suids and hippopotamus), mustelid and phocid species using immunohistochemistry. Expression of the ACE2 receptor was detected in the bronchial or bronchiolar epithelium of several European and Asiatic deer species, Bactrian camel (Camelus bactrianus), European badger (Meles meles), stoat (Mustela erminea), hippopotamus (Hippopotamus amphibious), harbor seal (Phoca vitulina), and hooded seal (Cystophora cristata). Further receptor mapping in the nasal turbinates and trachea revealed sparse ACE2 receptor expression in the mucosal epithelial cells and occasional occurrence in the submucosal glandular epithelium of Western roe deer (Capreolus capreolus), moose (Alces alces alces), and alpaca (Vicunga pacos). Only the European badger and stoat expressed high levels of ACE2 receptor in the nasal mucosal epithelium, which could suggest high susceptibility to ACE2-mediated respiratory infection. Expression of ACE2 receptor in the intestinal cells was ubiquitous across multiple taxa examined. Our results demonstrate the potential for ACE2-mediated viral infection in a selection of wild mammals and highlight the intra-taxon variability of ACE2 receptor expression, which might influence host susceptibility and infection.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37494882": "Ixodes scapularis (the blacklegged tick) was considered a species of no medical concern until the mid-1970s. By that time, the tick's geographic distribution was thought to be mainly in the southeastern United States (US), with additional localized populations along the Eastern Seaboard north to southern Massachusetts and in the Upper Midwest. Since 1975, I. scapularis has been implicated as a vector of seven human pathogens and is now widely distributed across the eastern US up to the border with Canada. Geographic expansion of tick-borne diseases associated with I. scapularis (e.g., Lyme disease, anaplasmosis, and babesiosis) is attributed to an expanding range of the tick. However, due to changes in tick surveillance efforts over time, it is difficult to differentiate between range expansion and increased recognition of already established tick populations. We provide a history of the documented occurrence of I. scapularis in the US from its description in 1821 to present, emphasizing studies that provide evidence of expansion of the geographic distribution of the tick. Deforestation and decimation of the white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), the primary reproductive host for I. scapularis adults, during the 1800s presumably led to the tick disappearing from large areas of the eastern US where it previously had been established. Subsequent reforestation and deer population recovery, together with recent climate warming, contributed to I. scapularis proliferating in and spreading from refugia where it had persisted into the early 1900s. From documented tick collection records, it appears I. scapularis was present in numerous locations in the southern part of the eastern US in the early 1900s, whereas in the north it likely was limited to a small number of refugia sites during that time period. There is clear evidence for established populations of I. scapularis in coastal New York and Massachusetts by 1950, and in northwestern Wisconsin by the late 1960s. While recognizing that surveillance for I. scapularis increased dramatically from the 1980s onward, we describe multiple instances of clearly documented expansion of the tick's geographic distribution in the Northeast, Upper Midwest, and Ohio Valley regions from the 1980s to present. Spread and local population increase of I. scapularis, together with documentation of Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto in host-seeking ticks, was universally followed by increases in Lyme disease cases in these areas. Southward expansion of northern populations of I. scapularis, for which the host questing behavior of the nymphal stage leads to substantially higher risk of human bites compared with southern populations, into Virginia and North Carolina also was followed by rising numbers of Lyme disease cases. Ongoing surveillance of ticks and tick-borne pathogens is essential to provide the data needed for studies that seek to evaluate the relative roles of land cover, tick hosts, and climate in explaining and predicting geographic expansion of ticks and tick-borne diseases.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25973622": "The meningeal worm (Parelaphostrongylus tenuis) is a parasite of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and is also a significant pathogen of moose (Alces alces) and other ungulates. Changes in climate or habitat may facilitate range expansion or increase the prevalence of meningeal worm infection in white-tailed deer, resulting in increased exposure to susceptible ungulates. We examined 3,730 white-tailed deer during 2002-05 to determine the prevalence and range of meningeal worm infection in North Dakota, US, and investigated whether these had changed since earlier surveys. We used multiple logistic regression to model potential effects of habitat and climate on prevalence in white-tailed deer. We also examined how habitat influences intermediate hosts by comparing gastropod abundance and microclimate among habitat types. Prevalence in deer was 14% statewide, and prevalence and geographic range had increased since the early 1990 s. Natural woodlands provided the best habitat for intermediate hosts, and increases in prevalence of infection in deer may be due to recent patterns in growing-season precipitation.

In the first analysis, the mitochondrial control region (D-loop) was sequenced in six Odocoileinae species from Latin America, using the sequences of two Muntiacinae as outgroups. The results obtained were as follows: A sequence of Mazama americana showed a striking relationship with several sequences of Odocoileus in contrast to that expected, since this M. americana haplotype, from a Mexican origin, was not associated with several Bolivian Mazama sequences analyzed. This could put forward that this genera is not monophyletic. On the other hand, these Bolivian Mazama formed a clade with Pudu puda and Ozotoceros bezoarticus. Likely, an Odocoileus virginianus sequence from the Central area of Colombia showed a more strong relationship with a Northamerican O. heminonus sequence than with the other O. virginianus sequences of Colombian origin as well. This could be explained by means of various different hypotheses. The first is the existence of common ancestral haplotypes between both species. Another one is the reiterative hybridization among both Odocoileus species before the migration of O. virginianus from North America to South America. Moreover, the maximum parsimony analysis showed an intense relationship between the Muntiacinae and this Neotropical Cervidae clade. In addition, and adding credence to the relevant polyphyletism found in Mazama by means of the mitochondrial control region DNA sequences, a second analysis with 16 DNA microsatellite loci also showed a higher genetic relationship between M. americana and O. virginianus, than between the first species regard to Mazama gouazoubira.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32671117": "Melanoma is one of the most immunologic malignancies based on its higher prevalence in immune-compromised patients, the evidence of brisk lymphocytic infiltrates in both primary tumors and metastases, the documented recognition of melanoma antigens by tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes and, most important, evidence that melanoma responds to immunotherapy. The use of immunotherapy in the treatment of metastatic melanoma is a relatively late discovery for this malignancy. Recent studies have shown a significantly higher success rate with combination of immunotherapy and chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or targeted molecular therapy. Immunotherapy is associated to a panel of dysimmune toxicities called immune-related adverse events that can affect one or more organs and may limit its use.

In this study, we used single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to map the transcriptional landscape of acral melanoma and identify novel immunotherapeutic targets.\nEXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We performed scRNA-seq on nine clinical specimens (five primary, four metastases) of acral melanoma. Detailed cell type curation was performed, the immune landscapes were mapped, and key results were validated by analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and single-cell datasets. Cell-cell interactions were inferred and compared with those in nonacral cutaneous melanoma.\nRESULTS: Multiple phenotypic subsets of T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, B cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells with varying levels of activation/exhaustion were identified. A comparison between primary and metastatic acral melanoma identified gene signatures associated with changes in immune responses and metabolism. Acral melanoma was characterized by a lower overall immune infiltrate, fewer effector CD8 T cells and NK cells, and a near-complete absence of \u03b3\u03b4 T cells compared with nonacral cutaneous melanomas. Immune cells associated with acral melanoma exhibited expression of multiple checkpoints including PD-1, LAG-3, CTLA-4, V-domain immunoglobin suppressor of T cell activation (VISTA), TIGIT, and the Adenosine A2A receptor (ADORA2). VISTA was expressed in 58.3% of myeloid cells and TIGIT was expressed in 22.3% of T/NK cells.\nCONCLUSIONS: Acral melanoma has a suppressed immune environment compared with that of cutaneous melanoma from nonacral skin.

Combination immunotherapy results in higher rates of response compared to anti-PD-1 monotherapy, at the expense of higher toxicity. Currently, there are no robust molecular biomarkers for the selection of first-line immunotherapy. We used flow cytometry to profile pretreatment tumor biopsies from 36 melanoma patients treated with anti-PD-1 or combination (anti-PD-1 plus anti-CTLA-4) immunotherapy. A novel quantitative score was developed to determine the tumor cell expression of antigen-presenting MHC class I (MHC-I) molecules, and to correlate expression data with treatment response. Melanoma MHC-I expression was intact in all tumors derived from patients who demonstrated durable response to anti-PD-1 monotherapy. In contrast, melanoma MHC-I expression was low in 67% of tumors derived from patients with durable response to combination immunotherapy. Compared to MHC-I high tumors, MHC-I low tumors displayed reduced T-cell infiltration and a myeloid cell-enriched microenvironment.

It is the most fatal among all types of EDS. In addition to typical EDS characteristics, vEDS patients are at risk of blood vessel rupture due to possession of pathogenic variants of the COL3A1 gene, which encodes type III collagen. Type III collagen is a major component of humans' vascular walls. The management of this disease is possible; however, there is no cure as of present. Recently, discoveries with potential impact on the management of vEDS have been elucidated. Mice with vEDS traits treated with a beta-blocker celiprolol showed significant improvements in their thoracic aorta biomechanical strength. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that the specifically designed small interference RNAs (siRNA) can effectively silence the pathogenic variant allele. To enhance the normal allele expression, an intracellularly expressed lysyl oxidase is shown to regulate the transcription rate of the COL3A1 promoter. Similarly, an embryonic homeobox transcription factor Nanog upregulates the wild-type COL3A1 expression through activation of the transforming growth factor-beta pathway, which increases type III collagen synthesis.

The maximum standardized uptake value (SUV<sub>max</sub>) of the primary tumor and LLN were preoperatively calculated using PET/CT. Simultaneously, the short axis of the lymph node was measured using multi-detector row computed tomography (MDCT). The presence of metastases was evaluated by postoperative pathological examination.\nRESULTS: Of the 84 patients, LLN metastases developed in the left, right, and both LLN regions in 6, 7, and 2 patients, respectively. The diagnosis of the metastases was predicted with a sensitivity of 82%, specificity of 93%, positive predictive value of 58%, negative predictive value of 98%, false positive value of 7%, and false negative value of 18% when the cutoff value of the LLN SUV<sub>max</sub> was set at 1.5.

We prospectively performed two FDG-PET scans in all patients to assess disease stage (1) at initial diagnosis and (2) presurgically, 4 to 5 weeks after protracted chemoradiation. Protracted chemoradiation was carried out during 5-6 weeks with 45-50 Gy, plus concurrent oral tegafur 1200 mg/day or 5-fluorouracil 500-1000 mg/m(2) administered as a 24-h continuous i.v. infusion on Days 1-4 and 21-25 of the radiotherapy treatment. Tumors were staged with CT in 95% of patients, whereas endorectal ultrasound was used in 90% of patients. Maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) was used as the quantitative parameter to estimate the tumor:tissue metabolic ratio.\nRESULTS: Preoperative chemoradiation significantly decreased the SUVMAX: 5.9 (mean SUVmax at initial staging) vs. 2.4 (mean SUVmax after chemoradiation) with p < 0.001. Unknown liver metastases were detected by FDG-PET in 2 patients, in 1 of them with the initial staging FDG-PET scan, and with the restaging FDG-PET scan in the other. After an average follow-up of 39 months, the value of SUVmax > or =6 allowed us to discriminate for survival at 3 years: 92% vs. 60% (p = 0.04).

Using a RI value of 63.6% as the cutoff threshold, it was possible to discriminate the CR from the non-CR with a sensitivity of 73.1%, a specificity of 64.5%, a PPV of 25.7%, a NPV of 93.5%, and an accuracy of 65.7% (area under the curve = 0.723, 95% confidence interval 0.619-0.828, P < 0.001).\nCONCLUSIONS: The accuracy of FDG-PET/CT restaging is superior to that of MRI staging for predicting pathologic CR in irradiated rectal cancer. An NPV of 93.5% indicates that FDG-PET/CT can rule out the pathologic CR.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23420438": "PURPOSE: The present study evaluated the predictive and prognostic impact of initial fluorine-18-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer treated with neoadjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT).\nMETHODS: Eighty-one consecutive patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (cT3-T4 N-/N+) treated with neoadjuvant CCRT were enrolled. The FDG-PET/CT parameters, including the SUVmax, metabolic tumor volume (MTV, 50 % of SUVmax), and multiplication of the SUVmean and MTV (total lesion glycolysis, TLG), were analyzed in relation to the pathologic response and disease recurrence.\nRESULTS: Five patients (6.2 %) achieved a pathologic complete response (pCR) after CCRT followed by surgery. None of the FDG-PET/CT parameters was identified as a predictive factor for pCR. After a median follow-up period of 26.7 (range 10.9-63.3) months, 19 patients (23.5 %) presented a local and/or distant recurrence. In a multivariate analysis including the clinicopathologic parameters, the TLG of the primary tumor was associated with a worse disease-free survival after neoadjuvant CCRT (HR 20.035, 95 % CI 1.726-232.559; P = 00.017).\nCONCLUSIONS: The TLG of the primary tumor in the initial FDG-PET/CT can be considered as a prognostic factor for patients with locally advanced rectal cancer treated with neoadjuvant CCRT.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32197449": "The endothelin axis, recognized for its vasoconstrictive action, plays a central role in the pathology of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Treatment with approved endothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs), such as bosentan, ambrisentan, or macitentan, slow down PAH progression and relieves symptoms. Several findings have indicated that endothelin is further involved in the pathogenesis of certain other diseases, making ERAs potentially beneficial in the treatment of various conditions. In addition to PAH, this review summarizes the use and perspectives of ERAs in cancer, renal disease, fibrotic disorders, systemic scleroderma, vasospasm, and pain management. Bosentan has proven to be effective in systemic sclerosis PAH and in decreasing the development of vasospasm-related digital ulcers. The selective ERA clazosentan has been shown to be effective in preventing cerebral vasospasm and delaying ischemic neurological deficits and new infarcts. Furthermore, in the SONAR (Study Of Diabetic Nephropathy With Atrasentan) trial, the selective ERA atrasentan reduced the risk of renal events in patients with diabetes and chronic kidney disease. These data suggest atrasentan as a new therapy in the treatment of diabetic nephropathy and possibly other renal diseases. Preclinical studies regarding heart failure, cancer, and fibrotic diseases have demonstrated promising effects, but clinical trials have not yet produced measurable results. Nevertheless, the potential benefits of ERAs may not be fully realized.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31593221": "AIMS: Although effective in preventing tumour growth, angiogenesis inhibitors cause off-target effects including cardiovascular toxicity and renal injury, most likely via endothelin (ET)-1 up-regulation. ET-1 via stimulation of the ETA receptor has pro-hypertensive actions whereas stimulation of the ETB receptor can elicit both pro- or anti-hypertensive effects. In this study, our aim was to determine the efficacy of selective ETA vs. dual ETA/B receptor blockade for the prevention of angiogenesis inhibitor-induced hypertension and albuminuria.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: Male Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats were treated with vehicle, sunitinib (angiogenesis inhibitor; 14\u2009mg/kg/day) alone or in combination with macitentan (ETA/B receptor antagonist; 30\u2009mg/kg/day) or sitaxentan (selective ETA receptor antagonist; 30 or 100\u2009mg/kg/day) for 8\u2009days. Compared with vehicle, sunitinib treatment caused a rapid and sustained increase in mean arterial pressure of \u223c25\u2009mmHg. Co-treatment with macitentan or sitaxentan abolished the pressor response to sunitinib. Sunitinib did not induce endothelial dysfunction. However, it was associated with increased aortic, mesenteric, and renal oxidative stress, an effect that was absent in mesenteric arteries of the macitentan and sitaxentan co-treated groups. Albuminuria was greater in the sunitinib- than vehicle-treated group. Co-treatment with sitaxentan, but not macitentan, prevented this increase in albuminuria. Sunitinib treatment increased circulating and urinary prostacyclin levels and had no effect on thromboxane levels. These increases in prostacyclin were blunted by co-treatment with sitaxentan.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that both selective ETA and dual ETA/B receptor antagonism prevents sunitinib-induced hypertension, whereas sunitinib-induced albuminuria was only prevented by selective ETA receptor antagonism. In addition, our results uncover a role for prostacyclin in the development of these effects. In conclusion, selective ETA receptor antagonism is sufficient for the prevention of sunitinib-induced hypertension and renal injury.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32249614": "Podocyte loss and proteinuria are both key features of human diabetic nephropathy (DN). The leptin-deficient BTBR mouse strain with the ob/ob mutation develops progressive weight gain, type 2 diabetes, and diabetic nephropathy that has many features of advanced human DN, including increased mesangial matrix, mesangiolysis, podocyte loss, and proteinuria. Selective antagonism of the endothelin-1 type A receptor (ET<sub>A</sub>R) by atrasentan treatment in combination with renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibition with losartan has been shown to have the therapeutic benefit of lowering proteinuria in patients with DN, but the underlying mechanism for this benefit is not well understood. Using a similar therapeutic approach in diabetic BTBR ob/ob mice, this treatment regimen significantly increased glomerular podocyte number compared with diabetic BTBR ob/ob controls and suggested that parietal epithelial cells were a source for podocyte restoration. Atrasentan treatment alone also increased podocyte number but to a lesser degree. Mice treated with atrasentan demonstrated a reduction in proteinuria, matching the functional improvement reported in humans. This is a first demonstration that treatment with the highly selective ET<sub>A</sub>R antagonist atrasentan can lead to restoration of the diminished podocyte number characteristic of DN in humans and thereby underlies the reduction in proteinuria in patients with diabetes undergoing similar treatment. The benefit of ET<sub>A</sub>R antagonism in DN extended to a decrease in mesangial matrix as measured by a reduction in accumulations of collagen type IV in both the atrasentan and atrasentan + losartan-treated groups compared with untreated controls.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32985601": "Several studies reported a central role of the endothelin type A receptor (ETAR) in tumor progression leading to the formation of metastasis. Here, we investigated the in vitro and in vivo anti-tumor effects of the FDA-approved ETAR antagonist, Ambrisentan, which is currently used to treat patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension. In vitro, Ambrisentan inhibited both spontaneous and induced migration/invasion capacity of different tumor cells (COLO-357 metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma, OvCar3 ovarian carcinoma, MDA-MB-231 breast adenocarcinoma, and HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia). Whole transcriptome analysis using RNAseq indicated Ambrisentan's inhibitory effects on the whole transcriptome of resting and PAR2-activated COLO-357 cells, which tended to normalize to an unstimulated profile. Finally, in a pre-clinical murine model of metastatic breast cancer, treatment with Ambrisentan was effective in decreasing metastasis into the lungs and liver.

The minor G allele of the non-coding single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs9349379 enhances expression of the endothelin 1 gene in human vascular cells, increasing circulating concentrations of ET-1. The prevalence of this allele is higher in patients with ischemic heart disease. Zibotentan is a potent, selective inhibitor of the ET<sub>A</sub> receptor. We have identified zibotentan as a potential disease-modifying therapy for patients with microvascular angina. METHODS: We will assess the efficacy and safety of adjunctive treatment with oral zibotentan (10 mg daily) in patients with microvascular angina and assess whether rs9349379 (minor G allele; population prevalence ~36%) acts as a theragnostic biomarker of the response to treatment with zibotentan. The PRIZE trial is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, sequential cross-over trial. The study population will be enriched to ensure a G-allele frequency of 50% for the rs9349379 SNP. The participants will receive a single-blind placebo run-in followed by treatment with either 10 mg of zibotentan daily for 12 weeks then placebo for 12 weeks, or vice versa, in random order. The primary outcome is treadmill exercise duration using the Bruce protocol. The primary analysis will assess the within-subject difference in exercise duration following treatment with zibotentan versus placebo.

Terminally ill horses can exhibit a range of clinical signs including frothy nasal discharge, ataxia or forebrain signs. Early signs, if detected, can include depression, inappetence, colic or mild respiratory signs. All unvaccinated ill horses in areas where flying foxes exist, may potentially be infected with HeV, posing a significant risk to the veterinary community. Equivac\u00ae HeV vaccine has been fully registered in Australia since 2015 (and under an Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority special permit since 2012) for immunization of horses against HeV and is the most effective and direct solution to prevent disease transmission to horses and protect humans. No HeV vaccinated horse has tested positive for HeV infection. There is no registered vaccine to prevent, or therapeutics to treat, HeV infection in humans. Previous equine HeV outbreaks tended to cluster in winter overlapping with the foaling season (August to December), when veterinarians and horse owners have frequent close contact with horses and their bodily fluids, increasing the chance of zoonotic disease transmission. The most southerly case was detected in 2019 in the Upper Hunter region in New South Wales, which is Australia's Thoroughbred horse breeding capital. Future spillover events are predicted to move further south and inland in Queensland and New South Wales, aligning with the moving distribution of the main reservoir hosts.

Here, we identified SLITRK1 as a downregulated gene in NSCs differentiated from PWS patient iPS cells by RNA sequencing analysis. Because SLITRK1 is involved in synaptogenesis, we focused on the synaptic formation and function of neurons differentiated from PWS patient iPS cells and NDN or MAGEL2 single gene defect mutant iPS cells. Although \u03b2III tubulin expression levels in all the neurons were comparable to the level of differentiation in the control, pre- and postsynaptic markers were significantly lower in PWS and mutant neurons than in control neurons.

The basic defect appears to be the absence of function of genes that are normally expressed in a monoallelic fashion only from the paternal chromosome. In 60-70% of patients with Prader-Willi syndrome, the genetic defect is a deletion in the area of 15q11-13 on the paternal chromosome. A further 25-30% of patients with Prader-Willi syndrome do not have paternal deletions, the defect being due to uniparental disomy (UPD) for maternal chromosome 15. Paternal deletions and maternal UPD are functionally equivalent, as they both result in the absence of a paternal contribution to the genome in the 15q11-13 region. The SNRPN (small nuclear ribonucleoprotein-associated polypeptide N) gene has a critical role in the 15q11-13 region, as it is probably part of the putative imprinting centre that regulates the expression of several genes in the Prader-Willi syndrome transcriptional domain. Two further rare causes of Prader-Willi syndrome are imprinting mutations, which are microdeletions or point mutations in the putative imprinting control region, and translocations with their breakpoints in the Prader-Willi syndrome region.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22903639": "Prader-Willi syndrome is caused by the lack of paternal contribution for the imprinted 15q11-q13 region that originates through a number of mechanisms such as paternal deletion of 15q11-q13, maternal uniparental disomy, or by an imprinting defect due to epimutations in the paternal imprinting center. In the present report, we describe a female patient with complex maternal uniparental trisomy for the 15q11-q13 Prader-Willi syndrome critical region due to a de novo interstitial duplication of 15q11-q13 region that is present in one of the maternal homologs.

A longer waiting time before surgery was associated with worse 5- and 10-year overall survival rates (67.6% [95% CI, 63.1%-71.7%] vs 80.3% [95% CI, 76.5%-83.6%] at 5 years; 40.1% [95% CI, 33.5%-46.5%] vs 57.8% [95% CI, 52.1%-63.0%] at 10 years; P\u2009<\u2009.001). Also, delayed surgery was associated with worse 5- and 10-year disease-free survival (59.6% [95% CI, 54.9%-63.9%] vs 72.0% [95% CI, 67.9%-75.7%] at 5 years; 36.2% [95% CI, 29.9%-42.4%] vs 53.9% [95% CI, 48.5%-59.1%] at 10 years; P\u2009<\u2009.001). At multivariate analysis, a longer waiting time was associated with an augmented risk of death (hazard ratio, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.50-2.26; P\u2009<\u2009.001) and death/recurrence (hazard ratio, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.39-2.04; P\u2009<\u2009.001).\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study, a longer interval before surgery after completing neoadjuvant CRT was associated with worse overall and disease-free survival in tumors with a poor pathological response to preoperative CRT. Based on these findings, patients who do not respond well to CRT should be identified early after the end of CRT and undergo surgery without delay.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32966845": "PURPOSE: Optimal timing of surgery after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (Nad-CRT) is still controversial in locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC). The primary goal of this study was to determine the best surgical interval (SI) to achieve the highest rate of pathological complete response (pCR) and secondly to evaluate the effect on survival outcomes according to the SI.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients data were extracted from the international randomized trials: Accord12/0405, EORTC22921, FFCD9203, CAO/ARO/AIO-94, CAO-ARO-AIO-04, INTERACT and TROG01.04. Inclusion criteria were: age\u2265 18, cT3-T4 and cN0-2, no clinical evidence of distant metastasis at diagnosis, Nad-CRT followed by surgery. Pearson's Chi-squared test with Yates' continuity correction for categorical variables, the Mann-Whitney test for continuous variables, Mann-Kendall test, Kaplan-Meier curves with log-rank test, univariate and multivariate logistic regression model was used for data analysis.\nRESULTS: 3085 patients met the inclusion criteria. Overall, the pCR rate was 14% at a median SI of 6\u00a0weeks (range 1-31). The cumulative pCR rate increased significantly when SI lengthened, with 95% of pCR events within 10\u00a0weeks from Nad-CRT. At univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis, lengthening of SI (p<\u00a00.01), radiotherapy dose (p<\u00a00.01), and the addition of oxaliplatin to Nad-CRT (p<\u00a00.01) had a favorable impact on pCR. Furthermore, lengthening of SI was not impact on local recurrences, distance metastases, and overall survival.\nCONCLUSION: This pooled analysis suggests that the best time to achieve pCR in LARC is at 10\u00a0weeks, considering that the lengthening of SI is not detrimental concerning survival outcomes.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26897480": "BACKGROUND: Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) has demonstrated proven benefit in tumor regression and improved long-term local control for patients with locally advanced rectal cancer. However, precise analysis of the optimal waiting time that maximizes oncologic benefits of nCRT has not been established.\nSTUDY DESIGN: The 2006-2012 National Cancer Data Base was queried for patients with stage II and III rectal adenocarcinoma who underwent nCRT followed by surgical resection. Time to surgery was defined as the difference between last date of radiotherapy and date of surgery. Primary study endpoints included resection margin positivity and pathologic downstaging. Multivariable regression modeling with restricted cubic splines was used to evaluate the adjusted association between time to surgery and our study endpoints, and to establish an optimal time threshold for surgery.\nRESULTS: A total of 11,760 patients were included. Median time to surgery was 53 days (interquartile range [IQR] 43 to 63 days). After adjusting for patient demographic, clinical, tumor, and treatment characteristics, our model determined an inflection point at 56 days after end of radiotherapy associated with the highest likelihood of complete resection and pathologic downstaging. With adjustment, the risk of margin positivity was increased in those who underwent surgery after 56 days from end of radiotherapy (odds ratio [OR] 1.40, 95% CI 1.21 to 1.61, p < 0.001).

Exclusion criteria were synchronous colon cancer, intraoperatively confirmed distal metastasis, multiple visceral resection, and emergency operation. Thirty-one patients underwent proximal extended resection and two were excluded for incomplete extended resection, then 29 patients were enrolled as the extended group. Using propensity scores matching with 1/1 ration, 29 locally advanced rectal cancer patients who underwent conventional resection after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy at the same time were matched as the conventional group.

The estimated incidence is less than 1 per 1 million. Here we report a male neonate with Kagami-Ogata syndrome presenting with severe respiratory distress requiring mechanical ventilation since birth.\nCASE PRESENTATION: A Sri Lankan male neonate born at term via caesarean section to a mother with type 1 diabetes mellitus and hypothyroidism developed respiratory distress immediately after birth. On examination, the baby had facial dysmorphism with a hirsute forehead, full cheeks, flat nasal bridge, elongated protruding philtrum, and micrognathia. His chest was small and bell shaped, and he had severe intercostal and subcostal recessions. His abdominal wall was lax and thin, with evidence of divarication of the recti. Bowel peristalsis was easily visible through the abdominal wall. The chest x-ray showed narrowing of the rib cage with crowding of the ribs in a \"coat-hanger\" appearance. The coat-hanger angle was 32\u00b0, and the mid-to-widest thoracic diameter was 68%. On the basis of facial dysmorphism, chest and anterior abdominal wall abnormalities, coat-hanger appearance of the rib cage, increased coat-hanger angle, and reduced mid-to-widest thoracic diameter, a clinical diagnosis of Kagami-Ogata syndrome was made. Owing to severe respiratory distress, the baby required intubation and ventilation immediately after birth. He was ventilator-dependent for 3\u00a0weeks; however, he was successfully weaned off the ventilator on day 22 after several failed extubation attempts. At 3-month follow-up, he had generalized hypotonia and mild global developmental delay. His developmental age corresponded to 2\u00a0months.\nCONCLUSIONS: We report a patient with Kagami-Ogata syndrome presenting with respiratory distress immediately after birth.

Before treatment initiation, a careful differential diagnosis and exclusion of other similar acquired demyelinating syndromes such as anti-aquaporin-4-associated neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (AQP4-NMOSD) and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody spectrum disorder (MOGSD) is warranted.

However, unlike their adult counterparts, the development, testing, and regulatory approval of POMS treatments have been significantly slower and hindered by logistic and/or ethical considerations. Currently, only two MS DMTs (fingolimod and teriflunomide) have been tested in large phase III trials and approved by regulatory agencies for use in POMS. First-line therapies not approved by the FDA for use in children (interferon-\u03b2 and glatiramer acetate) are also commonly used and result in a significant reduction in inflammatory activity when compared with non-treated POMS patients.

To explore a long-term nondietary restriction treatment, a somatic gene transfer approach in a PKU mouse model (C57Bl/6-Pahenu2) was employed to examine its preclinical feasibility. A recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vector containing the murine Pah-cDNA was generated, pseudotyped with capsids from AAV serotype 8, and delivered into the liver of PKU mice via single intraportal or tail vein injections. The blood Phe concentrations decreased to normal levels (< or =100 microM or 1.7 mg/dl) 2 weeks after vector application, independent of the sex of the PKU animals and the route of application. In particular, the therapeutic long-term correction in females was also dramatic, which had previously been shown to be difficult to achieve. Therapeutic ranges of Phe were accompanied by the phenotypic reversion from brown to black hair.

Recently, Trofinetide was approved by the USFDA on 10 March 2023 as the first RTT treatment. This article underlines the pharmaceutical advancement, patent literature, and prospects of Trofinetide. The data for this study were gathered from the PubMed database, authentic websites (Acadia Pharmaceuticals, Neuren Pharmaceuticals, and USFDA), and free patent databases. Trofinetide was first disclosed by Neuren Pharmaceuticals in 2000 as a methyl group containing analog of the naturally occurring neuroprotective tripeptide called glycine-proline-glutamate (GPE). The joint efforts of Acadia Pharmaceuticals and Neuren Pharmaceuticals have developed Trofinetide. The mechanism of action of Trofinetide is not yet well established. However, it is supposed to improve neuronal morphology and synaptic functioning. The patent literature revealed a handful of inventions related to Trofinetide, providing excellent and unexplored broad research possibilities with Trofinetide. The development of innovative Trofinetide-based molecules, combinations of Trofinetide, patient-compliant drug formulations, and precise MECP2-mutation-related personalized medicines are foreseeable. Trofinetide is in clinical trials for some neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), including treating Fragile X syndrome (FXS). It is expected that Trofinetide may be approved for treating FXS in the future. The USFDA-approval of Trofinetide is one of the important milestones for RTT therapy and is the beginning of a new era for the therapy of RTT, FXS, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), brain injury, stroke, and other NDDs.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28964591": "BACKGROUND: This study aimed to determine the safety and tolerability of trofinetide and to evaluate efficacy measures in adolescent and adult females with Rett syndrome, a serious and debilitating neurodevelopmental condition for which no therapies are available for its core features.\nMETHODS: This was an exploratory, phase 2, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study of the safety and tolerability of trofinetide in 56 adolescent and adult females with Rett syndrome. Subjects were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to 35\u00a0mg/kg twice daily of trofinetide or placebo for 14 days; 35\u00a0mg/kg twice daily or placebo for 28 days; or 70\u00a0mg/kg twice daily or placebo for 28 days. Safety assessments included adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, electrocardiograms, physical examinations, and concomitant medications. Efficacy measurements were categorized into four efficacy domains, which related to clinically relevant, phenotypic dimensions of impairment associated with Rett syndrome.\nRESULTS: Both 35\u00a0mg/kg and 70\u00a0mg/kg dose levels of trofinetide were well tolerated and generally safe. Trofinetide at 70\u00a0mg/kg demonstrated efficacy compared with placebo based on prespecified criteria.\nCONCLUSION: Trofinetide was well tolerated in adolescent and adult females with Rett syndrome. Although this study had a relatively short duration in a small number of subjects with an advanced stage of disease, consistent efficacy trends at the higher dose were observed in several outcome measures that assess important dimensions of Rett syndrome.

The significance of liquid biopsy results after resection of colorectal liver metastases (CLMs) is not well-defined.\nSTUDY DESIGN: Sixty-three patients undergoing CLM resection between 2016 and 2018 had plasma drawn postoperatively for liquid biopsy evaluation. Next-generation sequencing analysis was performed to detect somatic mutations in 70 genes.\nRESULTS: Liquid biopsy after CLM resection was positive in 42 of 63 patients (67%). Eleven patients (18%) had 1 gene mutation, 14 patients (22%) had 2 to 3 mutations, and 17 patients (27%) had 4 or more mutations. The most common mutation was APC, detected in 32 patients (76%), followed by TP53 (74%) and KRAS (38%). Two-year overall survival rate from date of liver resection was significantly worse among patients with a positive liquid biopsy (70% vs 100%; p\u00a0= 0.005), particularly for those with 4 or more gene mutations detected, whose 2-year overall survival rate was 41%. Sixteen of the 63 patients underwent serial liquid biopsies, resulting in 100 liquid biopsies with matched serum CEA and CT scan results.

As medicine evolves, new techniques appear, and oncology is one of the main beneficiaries. \"Liquid biopsy\" is one of the most recent domains of interest in oncology, as it may provide important details regarding the characteristics of the main tumor and its metastases. Malignant cells are in a continuous dynamic, which makes the initial diagnostic biopsy and the pathological specimen evaluation insufficient in the late evolution of the disease, when relapse or metastases may appear. The fact that the healthcare provider is able to find out additional information about the tumor at a given time, by evaluating a blood sample to obtain a \"liquid biopsy\" is of utmost importance and gives multiple potentially usable data. There are three means of obtaining biological material that may be used as \"liquid biopsy\": evaluation of circulating tumor cells, circulating tumor DNA and exosomes. The most intensely studied entity is that of circulating tumor cells, with different applications, amongst which the most important, at present time, is the prognostic value that has important demonstrated implications, not only in breast and prostate cancer, but also in colorectal cancer. Although surgery will, most certainly, not be replaced by other treatments when aiming for a curative approach to rectal cancer, it is important for the surgeon to know information about complementary fields, one of which is comprised by \"liquid biopsy\".", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35337361": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common cancers worldwide and a leading cause of carcinogenic death.

Metastatic liver disease develops in 50% of cases and drives patient outcomes. Although the ideal treatment for colorectal cancer liver metastases (CRLM) is resection, only a third of patients are suitable for this approach. Reports of liver transplantation in selected patients with unresectable CRLM have shown encouraging results compared to conventional forms of therapy. No study to date has examined the utility of liquid biopsy circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) for evaluation of residual disease in this cohort of patients. We report a small series of liver transplantation in patients with CRLM in whom ctDNA was assessed peri-operatively.\nMETHODS: Five patients underwent liver transplantation for unresectable CRLM or liver failure following CRLM treatment from 2018 to 2022. Clinical data, cross-sectional imaging, and serum biomarkers including peri-operative ctDNA were reviewed from electronic medical records.\nRESULTS: All patients are alive without radiologic evidence of disease at time of this publication. Median time of follow-up was 32\u00a0months (IQR 6.6-40\u00a0months). ctDNA was assessed before (4 patients) and after transplant (6 patients). One patient experienced a pulmonary recurrence that was resected, for whom pre-recurrence ctDNA was not available; the remaining patients have not experienced recurrence. Four patients are without evidence of ctDNA following transplant, and two demonstrate persistent ctDNA positivity post-transplant. Three of four patients with positive pre-transplant ctDNA remain ctDNA-negative post-transplant.\nCONCLUSIONS: Liver transplantation for liver-confined unresectable CRLM is emerging as a valid surgical option in selected patients. The significance of liquid biopsy in this population remains elusive due to lack of data. The clearance of ctDNA after transplant in these patients with metastatic disease and despite their immunosuppression is notable.

In this Review we challenge the widely accepted view that irritable bowel syndrome is an unexplained brain-gut disorder. There is epidemiological evidence that, in a major subset of patients, gastrointestinal symptoms arise first and only later do incident mood disorders occur. Additionally, possible mechanisms for gut-brain dysfunction have been identified, suggesting primary gut disturbances might be the underlying cause in a subgroup. Underlying mechanisms that could lead to irritable bowel syndrome include genetic factors (most notably an identified mutation of SCN5A); post-infectious changes, chronic infections and disturbances in the intestinal microbiota; low-grade mucosal inflammation, immune activation, and altered intestinal permeability; disordered bile salt metabolism (in 10-20% of cases with diarrhoea); abnormalities in serotonin metabolism; and alterations in brain function, which could be primary or secondary factors. Identical irritable bowel syndrome symptoms are probably due to different disease processes; grouping patients with this disorder into either diarrhoea-predominant or constipation-predominant subtypes promotes heterogeneity.

However, neither the longitudinal course of epilepsy nor the patterns of seizure onset and remission have been described in Rett syndrome and related conditions. The present study summarizes the findings of the Rett syndrome Natural History study. Participants with clinical Rett syndrome and those with MECP2 mutations without the clinical syndrome were recruited through the Rett Natural History study from 2006 to 2015. Clinical details were collected, and cumulative lifetime prevalence of epilepsy was determined using the Kaplan-Meier estimator. Risk factors for epilepsy were assessed using Cox proportional hazards models. Of 1205 participants enrolled in the study, 922 had classic Rett syndrome, and 778 of these were followed longitudinally for 3939 person-years. The diagnosis of atypical Rett syndrome with a severe clinical phenotype was associated with higher prevalence of epilepsy than those with classic Rett syndrome. While point prevalence of active seizures ranged from 30% to 44%, the estimated cumulative lifetime prevalence of epilepsy using Kaplan-Meier approached 90%. Specific MECP2 mutations were not significantly associated with either seizure prevalence or seizure severity. In contrast, many clinical features were associated with seizure prevalence; frequency of hospitalizations, inability to walk, bradykinesia, scoliosis, gastrostomy feeding, age of seizure onset, and late age of diagnosis were independently associated with higher odds of an individual having epilepsy. Aggressive behaviour was associated with lower odds. Three distinct patterns of seizure prevalence emerged in classic Rett syndrome, including those who did not have seizures throughout the study, those who had frequent relapse and remission, and those who had relentless seizures. Although 248 of those with classic Rett syndrome and a history of seizures were in terminal remission at last contact, only 74 (12% of those with a history of epilepsy) were seizure free and off anti-seizure medication. When studied longitudinally, point prevalence of active seizures is relatively low in Rett syndrome, although lifetime risk of epilepsy is higher than previously reported. While daily seizures are uncommon in Rett syndrome, prolonged remission is less common than in other causes of childhood onset epilepsy.

After a retrospective case-control study, the performance of the novel biomarker anti-BNLF2b total antibody (P85-Ab) was validated through a large-scale prospective screening program and compared with that of the standard two-antibody-based screening method (EBV nuclear antigen 1 [EBNA1]-IgA and EBV-specific viral capsid antigen [VCA]-IgA).\nRESULTS: P85-Ab was the most promising biomarker for nasopharyngeal carcinoma screening, with high sensitivity (94.4%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 86.4 to 97.8) and specificity (99.6%; 95% CI, 97.8 to 99.9) in the retrospective case-control study. Among the 24,852 eligible participants in the prospective cohort, 47 cases of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (38 at an early stage) were identified. P85-Ab showed higher sensitivity than the two-antibody method (97.9% vs. 72.3%; ratio, 1.4 [95% CI, 1.1 to 1.6]), higher specificity (98.3% vs. 97.0%; ratio, 1.01 [95% CI, 1.01 to 1.02]), and a higher positive predictive value (10.0% vs. 4.3%; ratio, 2.3 [95% CI, 1.8 to 2.8]).

For all irinotecan infusions, intravenous atropine was administered for patients experiencing any cholinergic reaction.\nRESULTS: A total of 532 irinotecan cycles (354 cycles for atropine-diphenoxylate group; 178 cycles for hyoscyamine group) were analyzed in 80 patients. Overall incidence of cholinergic syndrome did not differ between atropine-diphenoxylate (8.2%) and hyoscyamine (9.0%) groups (P = .76). The incidence of cholinergic syndrome after the \u00a3rst cycle of irinotecan was similar between the 2 arms, atropine-diphenoxylate (14.6%) and hyoscyamine (10.7%), with P = .74.

Patient backgrounds and clinical data during the first cycle of an irinotecan-containing regimen, including cholinergic syndrome manifestation within 24\u00a0h after the start of treatment, were collected from medical records. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to assess the risk of irinotecan-induced cholinergic syndrome.\nRESULTS: Among 179 patients administered an irinotecan-containing regimen, 51 experienced cholinergic syndrome after the initiation of treatment. The most common symptom was sweating followed by diarrhea, abdominal pain, lacrimation, and nasal discharge. 42 patients developed symptoms of cholinergic syndrome during their first treatment with irinotecan. Multivariate analyses revealed that the incidences of cholinergic syndrome in patients administered 2 or 3 chemotherapeutic agents; i.e., irinotecan plus 1 or 2 other cytotoxic anticancer drug(s), were significantly higher than that in patients administered irinotecan alone [odds ratio (OR) 4.35, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.5-12, p\u2009=\u20090.0053 and OR 4.50, 95% CI 1.5-14, p\u2009=\u20090.0093, respectively].

This retrospective study was performed to identify predictive factors of the development of irinotecan-related cholinergic syndrome in order to develop future strategies for improving the QoL of patients undergoing chemotherapy. We enrolled 150 cancer patients who underwent chemotherapy, which included irinotecan, in our outpatient chemotherapy center between October 2014 and January 2017. For regression analysis, variables related to the development of irinotecan-related cholinergic syndrome were extracted from the patient's clinical records. The degree of cholinergic syndrome was classified as follows: grade 0\u2009=\u2009not developed; grade 1\u2009=\u2009developed but did not require anticholinergic drugs; and grade 2\u2009=\u2009developed and required anticholinergic drugs or stopping the chemotherapy due to cholinergic syndrome. Multivariate ordered logistic regression analysis was performed to identify predictive factors for the development of irinotecan-related cholinergic syndrome.

This study investigated (1) the pattern of acetylcholinesterase activity in patients receiving treatment with irinotecan and (2) the relationship between acetylcholinesterase activity and plasma concentrations of irinotecan, 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (SN-38), and SN-38 glucuronide (SN-38G).\nMETHODS: Twenty-five patients with advanced colorectal cancer were treated with 250 mg/m(2) irinotecan administered by intravenous infusion for 60 minutes. Blood samples were collected before drug infusion and at 15 minutes and 45 minutes after the start of drug infusion. Blood acetylcholinesterase activity was determined by a colorimetric enzymatic assay, and irinotecan, SN-38, and SN-38G concentrations were determined in plasma by HPLC. The in vitro effects of irinotecan and other drugs on human acetylcholinesterase were also assessed.\nRESULTS: Compared with basal values, the activity of acetylcholinesterase in blood specimens collected during irinotecan infusion at 15 minutes (-0.76%) and at 45 minutes (-1.50%) showed no changes. No relationships were established between the activity of blood acetylcholinesterase at 15 or 45 minutes and plasma concentrations of irinotecan, SN-38, or SN-38G measured at the same time points.

The malfunction of FAM134B has been demonstrated to have a crucial role in the pathological mechanisms of diverse human ailments. However, the role of FAM134B-mediated ER-phagy in ototoxicity, particularly in cisplatin-induced ototoxicity, remains unclear. The present study endeavors to investigate whether FAM134B is expressed in House Ear Institute-Organ of Corti 1 (HEI-OC1) and C57BL/6 murine cochlear hair cells (HCs), and to explore its potential function in cisplatin-mediated ototoxicity, with the aim of discovering new insights that can mitigate or forestall the irreversible adverse effect of cisplatin.\nMETHODS: Immunofluorescence (IF) staining was used to test the expression pattern of FAM134B, levels of C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP), autophagy, and co-localization ratio of lysosomes and ER. Western blotting was employed to measure changes in expression levels of FAM134B, LC3B, ER stress-related proteins, LAMP1 and apoptotic mediators. Cell apoptosis was examined using transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay and flow cytometry.\nRESULTS: In the present investigation, it was observed that FAM134B exhibited a diffuse expression pattern in the cytoplasm and nuclei of control HEI-OC1 cells. Following cisplatin administration, FAM134B was found to accumulate and form distinct dots around the nuclei, concomitant with increased levels of ER-phagy, ER stress, unfolded protein response (UPR), and cell apoptosis. Additionally, knockdown of FAM134B resulted in reduced ER-phagy, mitigated ER stress and UPR, and decreased apoptotic activity in HEI-OC1 cells following cisplatin exposure.\nCONCLUSIONS: Collectively, the findings of this study demonstrate that FAM134B-mediated ER-phagy enhances the susceptibility of HCs to ER stress and apoptosis in response to cisplatin-induced stress. This suggests a sequential progression of ER-phagy, ER stress and apoptosis following cisplatin stimulus, and implies the potential therapeutic benefit of inhibiting of FAM134B-mediated ER-phagy in the prevention of cisplatin-related ototoxicity.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37728036": "Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress can stimulate the proliferation and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells while hindering apoptosis and immune system function, but the molecular mechanism of ER stress in HCC has yet to be fully studied.

Abnormalities in O-GlcNAcylation and ER-phagy have been documented in a wide variety of human pathologies. However, whether O-GlcNAcylation or ER-phagy is involved in the pathogenesis of intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) is largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the function of O-GlcNAcylation and ER-phagy and the related underlying mechanisms in IDD. We found that the expression profiles of O-GlcNAcylation and O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) were notably increased in degenerated NP tissues and nutrient-deprived nucleus pulposus (NP) cells. By modulating the O-GlcNAc level through genetic manipulation and specific pharmacological intervention, we revealed that increasing O-GlcNAcylation abundance substantially enhanced cell function and facilitated cell survival under nutrient deprivation (ND) conditions. Moreover, FAM134B-mediated ER-phagy activation was regulated by O-GlcNAcylation, and suppression of ER-phagy by FAM134B knockdown considerably counteracted the protective effects of amplified O-GlcNAcylation. Mechanistically, FAM134B was determined to be a potential target of OGT, and O-GlcNAcylation of FAM134B notably reduced FAM134B ubiquitination-mediated degradation. Correspondingly, the protection conferred by modulating O-GlcNAcylation homeostasis was verified in a rat IDD model. Our data demonstrated that OGT directly associates with and stabilizes FAM134B and subsequently enhances FAM134B-mediated ER-phagy to enhance the adaptive capability of cells in response to nutrient deficiency.

However, it remains unclear how ER scission is regulated for subsequent autophagosomal sequestration and lysosomal degradation. Here, we show that oligomerization of ER-phagy receptor FAM134B (also referred to as reticulophagy regulator 1 or RETREG1) through its reticulon-homology domain is required for membrane fragmentation in\u00a0vitro and ER-phagy in\u00a0vivo. Under ER-stress conditions, activated CAMK2B phosphorylates the reticulon-homology domain of FAM134B, which enhances FAM134B oligomerization and activity in membrane fragmentation to accommodate high demand for ER-phagy. Unexpectedly, FAM134B G216R, a variant derived from a type II hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy (HSAN) patient, exhibits gain-of-function defects, such as hyperactive self-association and membrane scission, which results in excessive ER-phagy and sensory neuron death. Therefore, this study reveals a mechanism of ER membrane fragmentation in ER-phagy, along with a signaling pathway in regulating ER turnover, and suggests a potential implication of excessive selective autophagy in human diseases.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33199694": "FAM134B (also called JK-1, RETREG1), a member of the family with sequence similarity 134, was originally discovered as an oncogene in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.

All English publications reporting the proportion of HNC specimens from SSA patients who tested positive for HPV and/or p16 were included. Study quality was assessed using the National Institutes of Health Quality Assessment Tool for Case Series Studies.\nRESULTS: In this systematic review of 31 studies and 3,850 patients, the overall p16 positivity was 13.6% (41 of 1,037 patients tested) with the highest proportion among oropharyngeal cancers (20.3%, 78 of 384 patients) and the overall HPV polymerase chain reaction positivity was 15.3% (542 of 3,548 samples tested) with the highest proportion among nasopharyngeal cancers (16.5%, 23 of 139 patients).

Here we demonstrate that AP-2\u03b1 facilitates melanoma metastasis through transcriptional activation of genes within the E2F pathway including EZH2. A BioID screen found that AP-2\u03b1 interacts with members of the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex. Loss of AP-2\u03b1 removed activating chromatin marks in the promoters of EZH2 and other E2F target genes through activation of the NuRD repression complex. In melanoma cells, treatment with tazemetostat, an FDA-approved and highly specific EZH2 inhibitor, substantially reduced anchorage-independent colony formation and demonstrated heritable antimetastatic effects, which were dependent on AP-2\u03b1. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of a metastatic melanoma mouse model revealed hyperexpansion of Tfap2a High/E2F-activated cell populations in transformed melanoma relative to progenitor melanocyte stem cells. These findings demonstrate that melanoma metastasis is driven by the AP-2\u03b1/EZH2 pathway and suggest that AP-2\u03b1 expression can be used as a biomarker to predict responsiveness to EZH2 inhibitors for the treatment of advanced melanomas.

TFAP2A was knocked-down in BLCA cells to study its impact on glucose uptake, lactate and ATP production, expression of HK2, and the number of vascular meshes formed by HUVEC. The target long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) of TFAP2A were predicted by bioinformatics tools, followed by ChIP-qPCR and luciferase assays. The downstream targets of TPRG1-AS1 were analyzed by microarray analysis. Rescue experiments were conducted for validation.\nRESULTS: TFAP2A upregulation in BLCA predicted dismal survival of patients. Loss of TFAP2A inhibited glycolysis (as evidenced by reduced glucose uptake, lactate, ATP production, and the expression of HK2) and angiogenesis (decreased number of vascular meshes formed by HUVEC). TFAP2A promoted the transcription of TPRG1-AS1. TPRG1-AS1 reversed the inhibitory effect of TFAP2A knockdown on glycolysis and angiogenesis in BLCA cells. TPRG1-AS1 inhibited the transcription of CRTAC1 by recruiting a DNA methyltransferase to the promoter of CRTAC1 and increasing the DNA methylation of its promoter.

Common adverse effects in the ADvocate1 and ADvocate2 trials were conjunctivitis (7 and 8%, respectively), nasopharyngitis (4 and 5%, respectively) and headache (3 and 5%, respectively). Results from clinical trials suggest that lebrikizumab may be a viable alternative for AD management.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36994947": "BACKGROUND: Lebrikizumab is a novel, high-affinity monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to interleukin (IL)-13.\nOBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of lebrikizumab monotherapy in adolescent and adult patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (AD) over 52 weeks of treatment in ADvocate1 (NCT04146363) and ADvocate2 (NCT04178967).\nMETHODS: Patients who responded to lebrikizumab 250\u2005mg every 2 weeks (Q2W) at the end of the 16-week induction period were re-randomized 2 : 2 : 1 to receive lebrikizumab Q2W, lebrikizumab 250\u2005mg every 4 weeks (Q4W) or placebo Q2W (lebrikizumab withdrawal) for 36 additional weeks. Response at week 16 was defined as achieving a 75% reduction in Eczema Area Severity Index (EASI 75) or an Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) of 0 or 1, with a \u2265 2-point improvement and no rescue medication use. Multiple imputation was used to handle missing data. Intermittent use of topical therapy was permitted during the maintenance period.\nRESULTS: After 52 weeks, an IGA of 0 or 1 with a \u2265 2 point improvement was maintained by 71.2% of patients treated with lebrikizumab Q2W, 76.9% of patients treated with lebrikizumab Q4W and 47.9% of patients in the lebrikizumab withdrawal arm. EASI 75 was maintained by 78.4% of patients treated with lebrikizumab Q2W, 81.7% of patients treated with lebrikizumab Q4W and 66.4% of patients in the lebrikizumab withdrawal arm at week 52. Across treatment arms, proportions of patients using any rescue therapy were 14.0% (ADvocate1) and 16.4% (ADvocate2). During the combined induction and maintenance periods of ADvocate1 and ADvocate2, 63.0% of lebrikizumab-treated patients reported any treatment emergent adverse event, with most events (93.1%) being mild or moderate in severity.\nCONCLUSIONS: After a 16-week induction period with lebrikizumab Q2W, lebrikizumab Q2W and Q4W maintained similar improvement of the signs and symptoms of moderate-to-severe AD, with a safety profile consistent with previously published data.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37266844": "Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common, heterogeneous, inflammatory skin disorder characterized by chronic or relapsing eczematous lesions with intense pruritus and discomfort. Affected patients often experience significant impairment in their quality of life, and the treatment of moderate-to-severe AD forms remains challenging. In the past few decades, increasing knowledge on the AD pathogenesis has driven the development of novel targeted therapies. Interleukin (IL)-13 plays a central and pleiotropic role in AD pathogenesis, contributing directly or indirectly to epidermal barrier disfunction, type-2 inflammation, dysbiosis, fibrosis, and itch response. For this reason, agents selectively targeting IL-13, such as lebrikizumab, emerged as a potential therapy for AD. This article reviews the current evidence about lebrikizumab in the management of AD. The phase II and phase III trials seem to corroborate efficacy of lebrikizumab in the treatment of moderate-to-severe AD, as shown by significant improvement of Eczema Area and Severity Index, body surface area, and pruritus scores. Also, lebrikizumab demonstrated favorable safety and tolerability profiles, with the majority of patients experiencing no significant adverse events. Lebrikizumab seems to be a promising emerging targeted biological agent for patients with moderate-to-severe AD. More data on the long-term efficacy and safety, head-to-head comparisons with other agents, and real-world evidence will help to clarify its place in therapy in AD.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29485322": "Purpose To compare the cost-effectiveness of computed tomographic (CT) colonography and colonoscopy screening by using data on unit costs and participation rates from a randomized controlled screening trial in a dedicated screening setting. Materials and Methods Observed participation rates and screening costs from the Colonoscopy or Colonography for Screening, or COCOS, trial were used in a microsimulation model to estimate costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained with colonoscopy and CT colonography screening. For both tests, the authors determined optimal age range and screening interval combinations assuming a 100% participation rate. Assuming observed participation for these combinations, the cost-effectiveness of both tests was compared. Extracolonic findings were not included because long-term follow-up data are lacking. Results The participation rates for colonoscopy and CT colonography were 21.5% (1276 of 5924 invitees) and 33.6% (982 of 2920 invitees), respectively. Colonoscopy was more cost-effective in the screening strategies with one or two lifetime screenings, whereas CT colonography was more cost-effective in strategies with more lifetime screenings. CT colonography was the preferred test for willingness-to-pay-thresholds of \u20ac3200 per QALY gained and higher, which is lower than the Dutch willingness-to-pay threshold of \u20ac20 000. With equal participation, colonoscopy was the preferred test independent of willingness-to-pay thresholds. The findings were robust for most of the sensitivity analyses, except with regard to relative screening costs and subsequent participation. Conclusion Because of the higher participation rates, CT colonography screening for colorectal cancer is more cost-effective than colonoscopy screening. The implementation of CT colonography screening requires previous satisfactory resolution to the question as to how best to deal with extracolonic findings. \u00a9 RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23006522": "OBJECTIVES: The European Code Against Cancer recommends individuals aged \u2265 50 should participate in colorectal cancer screening. CT-colonography (CTC) is one of several screening tests available. We systematically reviewed evidence on, and identified key factors influencing, cost-effectiveness of CTC screening.\nMETHODS: PubMed, Medline, and the Cochrane library were searched for cost-effectiveness or cost-utility analyses of CTC-based screening, published in English, January 1999 to July 2010. Data was abstracted on setting, model type and horizon, screening scenario(s), comparator(s), participants, uptake, CTC performance and cost, effectiveness, ICERs, and whether extra-colonic findings and medical complications were considered.\nRESULTS: Sixteen studies were identified from the United States (n = 11), Canada (n = 2), and France, Italy, and the United Kingdom (1 each). Markov state-transition (n = 14) or microsimulation (n = 2) models were used. Eleven considered direct medical costs only; five included indirect costs. Fourteen compared CTC with no screening; fourteen compared CTC with colonoscopy-based screening; fewer compared CTC with sigmoidoscopy (8) or fecal tests (4). Outcomes assessed were life-years gained/saved (13), QALYs (2), or both (1). Three considered extra-colonic findings; seven considered complications. CTC appeared cost-effective versus no screening and, in general, flexible sigmoidoscopy and fecal occult blood testing. Results were mixed comparing CTC to colonoscopy. Parameters most influencing cost-effectiveness included: CTC costs, screening uptake, threshold for polyp referral, and extra-colonic findings.\nCONCLUSION: Evidence on cost-effectiveness of CTC screening is heterogeneous, due largely to between-study differences in comparators and parameter values. Future studies should: compare CTC with currently favored tests, especially fecal immunochemical tests; consider extra-colonic findings; and conduct comprehensive sensitivity analyses.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16217110": "BACKGROUND: Computerized tomographic (CT) colonography is a potential alternative to colonoscopy for colorectal cancer screening. Its main advantage, a better safety profile, may be offset by its limitations: lower sensitivity, need for colonoscopy in cases where results are positive, and expense.\nMETHODS: We performed an economic evaluation, using decision analysis, to compare CT colonography with colonoscopy for colorectal cancer screening in patients over 50 years of age. Three-year outcomes included number of colonoscopies, perforations and adenomas removed; deaths from perforation and from colorectal cancer from missed adenomas; and direct health care costs. The expected prevalence of adenomas, test performance characteristics of CT colonography and colonoscopy, and probability of colonoscopy complications and cancer from missed adenomas were derived from the literature. Costs were determined in detail locally.\nRESULTS: Using the base-case assumptions, a strategy of CT colonography for colorectal cancer screening would cost 2.27 million dollars extra per 100,000 patients screened; 3.78 perforation-related deaths would be avoided, but 4.11 extra deaths would occur from missed adenomas. Because screening with CT colonography would cost more and result in more deaths overall compared with colonoscopy, the latter remained the dominant strategy. Our results were sensitive to CT colonography's test performance characteristics, the malignant risk of missed adenomas, the risk of perforation and related death, the procedural costs and differences in screening adherence.\nINTERPRETATION: At present, CT colonography cannot be recommended as a primary means of population-based colorectal cancer screening in Canada.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17156139": "BACKGROUND: We examined the cost-effectiveness of 2- and 3-dimensional computerized tomography (CT) colonography as a screening test for colorectal neoplasia.\nMETHODS: We created a Markov model of the natural history of colorectal cancer. Effectiveness of screening was based upon the diagnostic accuracy of tests in detecting polyps and cancer.\nRESULTS: CT colonography every 5 or 10 yr was effective and cost-effective relative to no screening. Optical colonoscopy dominates 2-dimensional CT colonography done every 5 or 10 yr. Optical colonoscopy is weakly dominant over 3-dimensional CT colonography done every 10 yr. 3-D CT colonography done every 5 yr is more effective than optical colonoscopy every 10 yr, but costs an incremental 156,000 dollars per life-year gained. Sensitivity analyses show that test costs, accuracy, and adherence are critical determinants of incremental cost-effectiveness. 3-D CT colonography every 5 yr is a dominant strategy if optical colonoscopy costs 1.6 times more than CT colonography. However, optical colonoscopy is a dominant strategy if the sensitivity of CT colonography for 1 cm adenomas is 83% or lower.\nCONCLUSIONS: CT colonography is an effective screening test for colorectal neoplasia. However, it is more expensive and generally less effective than optical colonoscopy. CT colonography can be reasonably cost-effective when the diagnostic accuracy of CT colonography is high, as with primary 3-dimensional technology, and if costs are about 60% of those of optical colonoscopy.

It has been advocated to become the new primary technique of screening for colorectal cancer. The economic feasibility of such recommendation, however, has not yet been evaluated.\nMETHODS: The cost-effectiveness of two screening strategies using CT colonography or conventional colonoscopy was compared by computer models based on a Markov process. We supposed that a hypothetical population of 100,000 subjects aged 50 yr undergoes a screening procedure every 10 yr. Suspicious findings of CT colonography are worked-up by colonoscopy. After polypectomy, colonoscopy is repeated every 3 yr until no adenomatous polyps are found.\nRESULTS: Under baseline conditions, screening by CT colonography costs $24,586 per life-year saved, compared with $20,930 spent on colonoscopy screening. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios comparing CT colonography to no screening and colonoscopy to CT colonography were $11,484 and $10,408, respectively. Screening by colonoscopy remains more cost-effective even if the sensitivity and specificity of CT colonography both rise to 100%. For the two screening procedures to become similarly cost-effective, CT colonoscopy needs to be associated with an initial compliance rate 15-20% better or procedural costs 54% less than colonoscopy.\nCONCLUSIONS: To become cost-effective and be able to compete with colonoscopy in screening for colorectal cancer, CT or MR colonography would need be offered at a very low price or result in compliance rates much better than those associated with colonoscopy.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37698547": "INTRODUCTION: Cryoglobulinemic vasculitis (CV), also known as mixed cryoglobulinemic syndrome (MCS), is a systemic vasculitis that affects small blood vessels.

The accurate clinical and serological evaluation plays a vital role in diagnosing MC, identifying potential comorbidities, and monitoring its main manifestations and complications. Treatment strategies should be individualized based on the underlying etiopathogenesis, the severity of organ involvement, and the associated underlying disease. At present, the two mainstays of CV treatment are direct antiviral agents (for HCV-related CV) and B-cell-targeted therapy.\nEXPERT OPINION: MC remains one of the few autoimmune diseases where the etiology is known, at least for the majority of patients. Its pathogenetic mechanism offers a unique opportunity to investigate the interplay between infections and the immune system.

Pulmonary involvement as organizing pneumonia, alveolar hemorrhage, and pulmonary vasculitis have been reported, but appear to be quite rare.\nCASE PRESENTATION: We report an uncommon case of a patient who presented with primary pulmonary syndrome without renal involvement in the setting of MC, due to untreated chronic hepatitis B infection. Early diagnosis and consequent institution of glucocorticoids, B-cell-depleting monoclonal antibody and antiviral therapy led to a favorable outcome and prevented any fatal sequelae.\nCONCLUSION: Pulmonary compromise in MC syndrome is very uncommon and carries a high rate of mortality.

Skin ulcers are often non-healing cutaneous lesions, possibly complicated by local infection and gangrene; they may severely affect the patients\u05f3 quality of life and the overall prognosis. Therefore, the treatment of cryoglobulinemic SU is particularly challenging in the clinical practice. The present work evaluated the prevalence and correlations of cryoglobulinemic SU with other clinico-epidemiological features of CV; moreover, our long-term experience with the management strategies of these cutaneous lesions was compared with the world literature on this topic.\nMETHODS: The study included 126 CV patients (24 male and 102 female, aged 69 \u00b1 11.2 SD years, disease duration 7 \u00b1 6.9 SD years), followed at our Rheumatology Unit during the past decade. All patients were carefully evaluated regarding the entire cryoglobulinemic syndrome with particular concern for clinical characteristics and treatment of SU.\nRESULTS: Among 126 CV patients, 36 individuals (29%) experienced at least one episode of SU, more commonly localized at the lower limbs. Patients with complicating SU showed significantly higher percentage of purpuric manifestations (p < 0.01) and liver (p < 0.001), peripheral nerve (p < 0.02), and/or thyroid involvement (p = 0.019). Therapeutic approach to SU included both systemic (immunosuppressors, corticosteroids, and/or plasma exchange) and local treatments. Local treatments consisted of sharp or surgical debridement as well as interactive dressing according to the condition of wound bed, perilesional skin, and the possible presence of infection, detected in 29 of 36 (81%) individuals in our Rheumatology unit. All patients underwent analgesic treatment for SU-related background pain as well as procedural pain, which was critical for an effective local SU management. The large majority of patients with SU healed at a variable time interval according to the severity of the single lesion; only five patients with very severe, non-healing SU needed amputation. The updated review of the literature revealed the presence of SU in around a quarter of CV patients. Among systemic treatments, the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab represents one of the most effective and frequently employed therapies; however, the available data focusing on local therapeutic approach are generally limited to anecdotal observations.\nCONCLUSIONS: Overall, the treatment of cryoglobulinemic SU should be tailored to the single patient\u05f3s conditions using combined systemic and local treatments; lesional sharp debridement and interactive dressing as well as procedural pain management were decisive, particularly for more severe, non-healing cutaneous lesions.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19918044": "OBJECTIVE: Mixed cryoglobulinemia (MC) is a systemic vasculitis of small and medium-size vessels, often associated with the hepatitis C virus.

Analysis of patients' characteristics revealed additional aspects of the pathology alongside the decrease in neuronal number. Here, we review the data from human, molecular, cell and animal model studies attempting to build the natural history of ZIKV in the embryonic central nervous system (CNS). We discuss how identifying the timing of infection and the pathways through which ZIKV may infect and spread through the CNS can help explain the diversity of phenotypes found in congenital ZIKV syndrome (CZVS). We suggest that intraneuronal viral transport is the primary mechanism of ZIKV spread in the embryonic brain and is responsible for most cases of CZVS.

Transcription factors (TFs) are master regulators of gene expression programs, which ultimately shape cell fate and homeostasis. A variety of TFs have been detected to be aberrantly expressed in brain tumors, being highly implicated in critical pathological aspects and progression of gliomas. Herein, we describe a selection of oncogenic (GLI-1/2/3, E2F1-8, STAT3, and HIF-1/2) and tumor suppressor (NFI-A/B, TBXT, MYT1, and MYT1L) TFs that are deregulated in gliomas and are subsequently associated with tumor development, progression, and migratory potential.

One of these main signaling mechanisms is the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB) pathway, which integrates multiple extracellular signals into transcriptional programs for tumor growth, invasion and maintenance of the tumor-initiating population. We show here that an extracellular protein released by glioblastoma cells, fibulin-3, drives oncogenic NF-\u03baB in the tumor and increases NF-\u03baB activation in peritumoral astrocytes. Fibulin-3 expression correlates with a NF-\u03baB-regulated 'invasive signature' linked to poorer survival, being a possible tissue marker for regions of active tumor progression. Accordingly, fibulin-3 promotes glioblastoma invasion in a manner that requires NF-\u03baB activation both in the tumor cells and their microenvironment. Mechanistically, we found that fibulin-3 activates the metalloprotease ADAM17 by competing with its endogenous inhibitor, TIMP3. This results in sustained release of soluble tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03b1) by ADAM17, which in turn activates TNF receptors and canonical NF-\u03baB signaling. Taken together, our results underscore fibulin-3 as a novel extracellular signal with strong activating effect on NF-\u03baB in malignant gliomas. Because fibulin-3 is produced de novo in these tumors and is absent from the normal brain, we propose that targeting the fibulin-3/NF-\u03baB axis may provide a novel avenue to disrupt oncogenic NF-\u03baB signaling in combination therapies for malignant brain tumors.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37821870": "Glioma is the most aggressive and malignant type of primary brain tumor, comprises the majority of central nervous system deaths, and is categorized into different subgroups according to its histological characteristics, including astrocytomas, oligodendrogliomas, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), and mixed tumors.

E2F1, E2F2, E2F7, and E2F8 were highly correlated with aggressive proliferation oncogenes, as well as potential therapeutic resistance oncogenes. Elevated E2Fs (not E2F3) were associated with adverse tumor features and poorer outcome. E2F7 and E2F8 exhibited superior outcome prediction performance compared with other E2Fs. Additionally, E2F7 and E2F8 independently predicted poorer survival in HGG patients. Gene set enrichment analysis identified a variety of critical oncogenic pathways that were tightly associated with E2F7 or E2F8, including epithelial-mesenchymal transition, NF\u03baB, STAT3, angiogenesis pathways. Furthermore, elevated expression of E2F7 indicated worse therapeutic response of HGG to irradiation and silencing of E2F7 conferred higher cell-killing effect when combined with irradiation treatment. Mechanically, E2F7 directly regulates the transcriptional activity of EZH2 via binding at the corresponding promoter area.\nCONCLUSIONS: E2Fs (except for E2F3 and E2F5) are highly expressed in HGG and indicate adverse outcome. E2F7 and E2F8 were identified as novel potential prognostic markers in HGG. E2F7 was further validated to be closely associated with radioresistance of HGG and a critical transcriptional regulator of EZH2.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36450570": "Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is a mosquito-borne virus belonging to the JEV serocomplex within the genus Flavivirus, family Flaviviridae. It has 5 genotypes, G1-G5, based on the envelope (E) protein nucleotide sequence. JEV G3 circulated in Japan until the early 1990s when it was replaced by G1. JEV G3 was isolated from swine serum samples (sw/Kochi/1/2004) in the Kochi Prefecture, western Japan, in 2004. In addition, the 2018 isolates from pigs and cows (sw/Kochi/492/2018 and bo/Kochi/211/2018) in the same prefecture were identified as G3. The nucleotide sequencing results of the sw/Kochi/492/2018 and bo/Kochi/211/2018 polyprotein region differed from those of the sw/Kochi/1/2004 strain described in our previous report. Seven JEV isolates were identified as G1 in the same geographical area as that in this study.

Less is known about sputum periostin as a biomarker in asthma as detection levels are low using currently available periostin assays. We aimed to investigate detection of sputum periostin using ELISA assays targeting different periostin epitopes and relate levels to clinical characteristics.\nMETHODS: Two ELISA systems were developed using antibodies detecting whole periostin or cleavage products, the molecular weight and amino acid sequences of which were confirmed. The ELISA assays were applied to sputum from 80 patients with mild-to-moderate and severe asthma enrolled in the European, multi-center study BIOAIR. Results were related to clinical characteristics.\nRESULTS: Sputum was found to contain smaller periostin fragments, possibly due to proteolytic cleavage at a C-terminal site. Comparing ELISA methodology using antibodies against cleaved versus whole periostin revealed detectable levels in 90% versus 44% of sputum samples respectively. Sputum periostin showed associations with blood and sputum eosinophils. Furthermore, sputum, but not serum, periostin correlated with reduced lung function and sputum IL-13 and was reduced by oral corticosteroid treatment.\nCONCLUSIONS: We present an ELISA method for improved analysis of sputum periostin by detecting cleavage products of the periostin protein. Using this assay, sputum periostin was detectable and associated with more disease-relevant parameters in asthma than serum periostin.

The particular epidemiological features of this tumor initiated the search for a virus as the causative agent and led to the discovery of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) by Epstein and coworkers in 1964. It became apparent in the seventies and eighties that the tumor is not restricted to Central Africa, but occurs with lesser incidence all over the world (sporadic BL) and is also particularly frequent in HIV infected individuals, and that not all BL cases are associated with EBV: about 95% of the cases in Central Africa, 40 to 50% of the cases in HIV-infected individuals and 10 to 20% of the sporadic cases harbour the viral information and express at least one viral antigen (EBNA1) and a number of non-coding viral RNAs. In contrast, all BL cases regardless of their geographical origin exhibit one of three c-myc/Ig chromosomal translocations leading to the activation of the c-myc gene as a crucial event in the development of this disease. Although epidemiological evidence clearly points to a role of the virus in the African cases, the role of EBV in the pathogenesis of BL has remained largely elusive.

Malignant gliomas commonly overexpress the oncogenes EGFR and PDGFR and contain mutations and deletions of the tumor suppressor genes PTEN and TP53. Some of these alterations lead to activation of the P13K/Akt and Ras/MAPK pathways, which provide targets for therapy. Perillyl alcohol (POH), the isoprenoid of greatest clinical interest, was initially considered to inhibit farnesyl protein transferase. Follow-up studies revealed that POH suppresses the synthesis of small G proteins, including Ras. Intranasal delivery allows drugs that do not cross the blood-brain barrier to enter the central nervous system. Moreover, it eliminates the need for systemic delivery, thereby reducing unwanted systemic side effects.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Applying this method, a phase I/II clinical trial of POH was performed in patients with relapsed malignant gliomas after standard treatment: surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. POH was administrated in a concentration of 0.3% volume/volume (55 mg) four times daily in an interrupted administration schedule. The objective was to evaluate toxicity and progression-free survival (PFS) after six months of treatment. The cohort consisted of 37 patients, including 29 with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), 5 with grade III astrocytoma (AA), and 3 with anaplastic oligodendroglioma (AO). Neurological examination and suitable image analysis (computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) established disease progression. Complete response was defined as neurological stability or improvement of conditions, disappearance of CT/MRI tumor image, and corticosteroid withdraw; partial response (PR) as > or =50 reduction of CT/MRI tumor image, neurological stability, or improvement of conditions and corticosteroid requirement; progressive course (PC) as > or =25 increase in CT/MRI tumor image or the appearance of a new lesion; and stable disease as a lack of any changes in the CT/MR tumor image or neurological status.\nRESULTS: After six months of treatment, PR was observed in 3.4% (n=1) of the patients with GBM and 33.3% (n=1) with AO; stable disease in 44.8% (n=13) with GBM, 60% (n=3) with AA, and 33.3% (n=1) with AO; and PC in 51.7% (n=15) with GBM, 40% (n=2), with AA and 33.3% (n=1) AO. PFS (sum of PRs and stable disease) was 48.2% for GBM, 60% for AA, and 66.6% for AO patients.\nCONCLUSIONS: The preliminary results indicate that intranasal administration of the signal transduction inhibitor POH is a safe, noninvasive, and low-cost method.

Because perturbation of any component in this pathway may have similar oncogenic effects, we studied the relationship between abnormalities of CDKN2/p16 and RB, the two commonly involved tumor suppressor genes, in 55 astrocytic gliomas (42 GBMs, 8 anaplastic astrocytomas, and 5 astrocytomas). By using comparative multiplex PCR, homozygous deletions of the CDKN2/p16 gene were detected in 24 GBMs (57%) and in 2 anaplastic astrocytomas. Two additional GBMs and one anaplastic astrocytoma had allelic loss of chromosome 9p, as assessed by microsatellite polymorphisms flanking the CDKN2/p16 region. Single-strand conformation polymorphism and DNA sequencing analysis of all three coding exons of CDKN2/p16 revealed a frameshift mutation (four-bp deletion) in one of the three GBMs that had lost the remaining 9p allele. Allelic loss of chromosome 13q at the RB gene, RB gene mutations, or loss of pRb expression was noted in 14 GBMs (33%) and 2 anaplastic astrocytomas. Thirty-six of 42 GBMs (86%) had alterations of either CDKN2/p16 (n = 22), RB (n = 10), or both (n = 4); these two genetic changes, however, were relatively exclusive (P = 0.003). Furthermore, of the six GBMs without either CDKN2/p16 or RB gene abnormalities, one case had CDK4 gene amplification. These data indicate that the vast majority of GBMs probably have inactivation of the p16-cdk4/cyclin D1-pRb pathway. The findings also provide corroborative evidence that CDKN2/p16 and RB are the critical glioma tumor suppressor genes on chromosomes 9p and 13q, respectively.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10079373": "The genetic alterations frequently involved in glial malignancies are in the tumor suppressor genes, Rb and p53. An altered Rb expression or p53 overexpression is thought to indicate defective tumor suppression and subsequently more aggressive tumors. Therefore, to assess the alterations in the conjoint expression of Rb and p53 proteins in formalin fixed paraffin embedded sections, 64 astrocytic tumors were studied (16 astrocytomas,7 gemistocytic astrocytomas, 19 anaplastic astrocytomas and 22 glioblastomas) using the avidin biotin immunoperoxidase technique. Fifty two cases (81.25%) were found to be positive for p53 protein. Seventeen of these showed aberrant heterogenous staining for pRb, of which 7 were glioblastomas. Only one case of astrocytoma showed aberrant expression of both p53 and Rb. Thus, of the 64 tumors, simultaneous aberrant expression of both p53 and Rb was seen in 21.9% of cases. This was more commonly observed among glioblastoma cases (7/22). No statistical difference was found between the survival rate of heterogenous pRb and p53 positivity in different grades of tumors. In glioblastomas, the survival rate appeared to be less in patients expressing heterogenous pRb, but this was not statistically significant.

Analysis of the 8 genes (PTEN, TP53, EGFR, PIK3R1, PIK3CA, NF1, RB1, IDH1) that are mutated in at least 5% of GBM tumors indicates a non-random mutation pattern that reflects a significant role for hydrolytic deamination at CpG sites. The formation of activating mutations in some genes, e.g., IDH1, where a very limited set of mutations are oncogenic, statistically cannot involve random mutagenesis due to polymerase errors that occur during each stem cell replication. Comparison of the in\u00a0vitro misincorporation tendencies of three replicative polymerases and the \"random\" mutation pattern in a subset of genes indicates non-polymerase based pathways are involved. Analysis of the mutation patterns shows that chemical deamination that occurs at a slow rate at each CpG is favored over random polymerase errors by a factor of more than 10 million.

Analysis of eight microsatellites from 10q revealed loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in 25 of 36 glioblastomas (69%). Twenty-three of these tumors demonstrated LOH at all informative loci. Two glioblastomas showed LOH restricted to markers located distally to PTEN, with breakpoints mapping telomeric to D10S541 and D10S185. One glioblastoma demonstrated evidence of homozygous deletion of PTEN by differential PCR analysis. PTEN mutations were detected in 9 of 36 glioblastomas (25%). Seven of these tumors showed LOH at all informative loci from 10q, indicating complete loss of wild-type PTEN. Although loss of 10q was detected by comparative genomic hybridization and/or LOH analysis in 14 of the 34 meningiomas investigated (41%), none of these tumors showed evidence of PTEN mutations or homozygous gene deletions. Our findings corroborate that PTEN is inactivated in a subset of glioblastomas. However, the lack of detectable PTEN alterations in a considerable fraction of glioblastomas and all meningiomas with 10q loss strongly supports the hypothesis that at least one additional tumor suppressor gene is located on 10q.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36565132": "BACKGROUND: Dystrophinopathies are associated with neuropsychiatric disorders due to alterations in dystrophin/DMD expression.\nOBJECTIVE: The objective was to estimate the association of developmental disorders, autism spectrum disorders (ASD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), depression, anxiety disorders, and obsessive-compulsive disorder with the dystrophin/DMD genotype in population with dystrophinopathies.\nMETHODS: Systematic searches of Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library were performed from inception to September 2022. We included observational studies in the population with Becker or Duchenne muscular dystrophies (BMD, DMD) that estimated the prevalence of these disorders according to Dp140 and/or Dp71 genotype. Meta-analysis of the prevalence ratio (PR) of genotype comparisons was conducted for each disorder.\nRESULTS: Ten studies were included in the systematic review. In BMD, Dp140+ vs. Dp140- and Dp71+ vs. Dp71- were associated with developmental disorders with a PR of 0.11 (0.04, 0.34) and 0.22 (0.07, 0.67), respectively. In DMD, Dp140+/Dp71+ vs. Dp140- /Dp71- had a PR of 0.40 (0.28, 0.57), and Dp71+ vs. Dp71- had a PR of 0.47 (0.36, 0.63) for ADHD.

Many of the classical radiological signs are considered to represent the two adjacent loops of bowel in a mesentero-axial volvulus. However, limited case reports and series have reported on an organo-axial subtype of sigmoid volvulus. This clinical entity is not widely understood. In this study, we assess the radiological and clinical features of mesentero-axial and organo-axial sigmoid volvulus.\nMETHODS: After institutional board approval (CH62/6/2016-228), all computed tomography (CT) studies from 2011 to 2017 reported as sigmoid volvulus at a single institution were reviewed. The cases were reviewed by three radiologists retrospectively and the course of the bowel followed with a focus on assessing its rotational axis. In each case, the sigmoid volvulus was independently subclassified as mesentero-axial or organo-axial volvulus based on the axis of rotation of the volvulus. In addition, X-ray signs including disproportionate sigmoid dilatation, distended inverted 'U' in sigmoid, coffee bean sign, opposed wall sign, direction of apex of sigmoid loop, liver overlap sign, northern exposure sign and proximal colonic dilatation and CT features including whirl sign, 'X' marks the spot sign, split wall sign and number of transition points were reported for each case. The clinical management and outcomes including morbidity, mortality, endoscopic decompression and need for surgery were also evaluated. The subtype of volvulus was correlated with the above X-ray signs, CT features and clinical management and outcomes. Statistical analysis was conducted using Stata/MP, version 15 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA).\nRESULTS: A total of 38 scans were reviewed. There were 19 patients identified. Of these, six (32%) were reported as mesentero-axial and 13 (68%) as organo-axial volvulus. No X-ray signs were able to distinguish the two types of volvulus. The number of transition points on CT was predictive of volvulus subtype (OR 25, 95% CI: 1.30-1295.30, P\u2009=\u20090.01). Within the limitations of a small cohort, there was no statistically significant difference in unsuccessful endoscopic decompression, need for colectomy, repeated admissions or mortality between the groups.\nCONCLUSION: This study has demonstrated that organo-axial sigmoid volvulus may be as common as mesentero-axial volvulus. Distinguishing organo-axial from mesentero-axial volvulus can be achieved on CT, but not on abdominal X-ray. The number of transition points (two for mesentero-axial and one for organo-axial) may be used as a diagnostic feature for differentiating the two forms of volvulus.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36779459": "Intestinal obstruction due to sigmoid volvulus (SV) represents a relevant percentage of abdominal diseases presenting at the emergency department.

This study was conducted to identify markers that are associated with disease control in patients treated with cetuximab.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred ten patients with metastatic colorectal cancer were enrolled onto a cetuximab monotherapy trial. Transcriptional profiling was conducted on RNA from mandatory pretreatment metastatic biopsies to identify genes whose expression correlates with best clinical responses. EGFR and K-ras mutation analyses and EGFR gene copy number analyses were performed on DNA from pretreatment biopsies.\nRESULTS: Gene expression profiles showed that patients with tumors that express high levels of the EGFR ligands epiregulin and amphiregulin are more likely to have disease control with cetuximab (EREG, P = .000015; AREG, P = .000025). Additionally, patients whose tumors do not have K-ras mutations have a significantly higher disease control rate than patients with K-ras mutations (P = .0003).

We investigated whether AREG/EREG IHC could predict benefit from the anti-EGFR agent panitumumab.\nEXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Artificial intelligence algorithms were developed to assess AREG/EREG IHC in 274 patients from the PICCOLO trial of irinotecan with or without panitumumab (Ir vs. IrPan) in RAS wild-type mCRC. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary endpoints were RECIST response rate (RR) and overall survival (OS). Models were repeated adjusting separately for BRAF mutation status and primary tumor location (PTL).\nRESULTS: High ligand expression was associated with significant PFS benefit from IrPan compared with Ir [8.0 vs. 3.2 months; HR, 0.54; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.37-0.79; P = 0.001]; whereas low ligand expression was not (3.4 vs. 4.4 months; HR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.74-1.49; P = 0.78).

These monoclonal antibodies are directed against EGFR and influence cell division, attachment, angiogenesis, migration and apoptosis.

The proteins Amphiregulin and Epiregulin belong to the Epidermal growth factors family (EGF, that act through the EGFR. Over-expression of these proteins has been seen in a variety of malignancies and non-malignant pathologies.

Interestingly, a large proportion of mitochondrial diseases are caused by defects in genes associated with tRNA metabolism. We recently discovered that partial loss-of-function mutations in tRNA Nucleotidyl Transferase 1 (TRNT1), the nuclear gene encoding the CCA-adding enzyme essential for modifying both nuclear and mitochondrial tRNAs, causes a multisystemic and clinically heterogenous disease termed SIFD (sideroblastic anemia with B-cell immunodeficiency, periodic fevers, and developmental delay; SIFD). However, it is not clear how mutations in a general and essential protein like TRNT1 cause disease with such clinically broad but unique symptomatology and tissue involvement. Using biochemical, cell, and mass spectrometry approaches, we demonstrate that TRNT1 deficiency is associated with sensitivity to oxidative stress, which is due to exacerbated, angiogenin-dependent cleavage of tRNAs. Furthermore, reduced levels of TRNT1 lead to phosphorylation of Eukaryotic Translation Initiation Factor 2 Subunit Alpha (eIF2\u03b1), increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and changes in the abundance of distinct proteins.

The first presented with acute lactic acidosis at 3 weeks of age and developed severe developmental delay, hypotonia, microcephaly, seizures, progressive cortical atrophy, neurosensorial deafness, sideroblastic anemia and renal Fanconi syndrome, dying at 21 months. The second presented at 3.5 years with gait ataxia, dysarthria, gross motor regression, hypotonia, ptosis and ophthalmoplegia and had abnormal signals in brainstem and dentate nucleus. In subject 1, muscle biopsy showed combined oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) defects, but there was no OXPHOS deficiency in fibroblasts from either subject, despite a 10-fold-reduction in TRNT1 protein levels in fibroblasts of the first subject. Furthermore, in normal controls, TRNT1 protein levels are 10-fold lower in muscle than in fibroblasts. High resolution northern blots of subject fibroblast RNA suggested incomplete CCA addition to the non-canonical mitochondrial tRNA(Ser(AGY)), but no obvious qualitative differences in other mitochondrial or cytoplasmic tRNAs. Complete knockdown of TRNT1 in patient fibroblasts rendered mitochondrial tRNA(Ser(AGY)) undetectable, and markedly reduced mitochondrial translation, except polypeptides lacking Ser(AGY) codons. These data suggest that the clinical phenotypes associated with TRNT1 mutations are largely due to impaired mitochondrial translation, resulting from defective CCA addition to mitochondrial tRNA(Ser(AGY)), and that the severity of this biochemical phenotype determines the severity and tissue distribution of clinical features.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28390992": "Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a heterogeneous group of monogenic disorders characterized by progressive death of the light-sensing photoreceptor cells of the outer neural retina.

HPAP implementation resulted in the following significant benefits: Decreased cumulative incidence of waitlist death within 1 and 2 years (p < 0.0001); increased cumulative incidence of transplantation within 6 months, from 44% to 67% (p < 0.01); and improved survival after listing (at 1, 3, and 5 years: 61%, 50%, and 44% vs. 92%, 84%, and 72% before and after HPAP implementation, respectively; p\u202f=\u202f0.02).\nCONCLUSION: HPAP implementation was associated with significant improvements in access to transplantation and in survival after listing in children with end-stage PAH.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32067330": "BACKGROUND: Pediatric heart-lung transplantation (HLT) is rare, and no report has analyzed patient outcomes since time of listing. We analyzed pediatric HLTs to understand risk factors for waitlist and post-HLT mortality.\nMETHODS: All pediatric (<18\u00a0year old) HLT candidates were identified within the UNOS database (n\u00a0=\u00a0573) and grouped by age, era, and by diagnosis. Logistical regression and Cox proportional hazard modeling identified risk factors for 6-month WL and overall post-transplant mortality.\nRESULTS: 209/573 (37%) HLT candidates were transplanted, 7% recovered, 42% died waiting, and 15% were removed for another/unknown reason. Diagnoses were primary pulmonary hypertension(n\u00a0=\u00a0130), congenital heart disease(CHD) without Eisenmenger's syndrome (ES) (n\u00a0=\u00a065), CHD with ES (n\u00a0=\u00a073), and other (n\u00a0=\u00a0305). Patients with a diagnosis other than CHD with ES (OR: 7.55, P\u00a0=\u00a0.001), on IV inotropic support (OR: 2.79, P\u00a0<\u00a0.001), and infants (OR: 2.20, P\u00a0=\u00a0.004) were associated with waitlist mortality. There has been a 56% reduction in HLTs across eras (Era 1:10.8/yr vs Era 2:4.7/yr). Risk factors for post-transplant mortality were ECMO (HR: 4.1, P\u00a0=\u00a0.016), and being infant (HR: 2.2, P\u00a0=\u00a0.04) or 1-11\u00a0years old (HR: 1.78, P\u00a0=\u00a0.015). ECMO patients have an 87% 2-year mortality rate with a median post-transplant survival of 64\u00a0days. Overall, post-transplant survival was unchanged (log-rank P\u00a0=\u00a0.067) between eras. Excluding ECMO patients, in the recent era 29 non-infant patients with primary pulmonary hypertension had 93% 1-year survival and 67% 5-year survival.\nCONCLUSIONS: Nearly 600 pediatric patients have been listed for HLT in UNOS, although numbers are decreasing in the current era.

However, the role of TAD boundaries in effectively restricting these interactions remains unclear. Here, we show that a significant proportion of enhancer-promoter interactions are established across TAD boundaries in Drosophila embryos, but that developmental genes are strikingly enriched in intra- but not inter-TAD interactions. We pursued this observation using the twist locus, a master regulator of mesoderm development, and systematically relocated one of its enhancers to various genomic locations. While this developmental gene can establish inter-TAD interactions with its enhancer, the functionality of these interactions remains limited, highlighting the existence of topological constraints. Furthermore, contrary to intra-TAD interactions, the formation of inter-TAD enhancer-promoter interactions is not solely driven by genomic distance, with distal interactions sometimes favored over proximal ones. These observations suggest that other general mechanisms must exist to establish and maintain specific enhancer-promoter interactions across large distances.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35418676": "Chromosome structure in mammals is thought to regulate transcription by modulating three-dimensional interactions between enhancers and promoters, notably through CTCF-mediated loops and topologically associating domains (TADs)1-4. However, how chromosome interactions are actually translated into transcriptional outputs remains unclear. Here, to address this question, we use an assay to position an enhancer at large numbers of densely spaced chromosomal locations relative to a fixed promoter, and measure promoter output and interactions within a genomic region with minimal regulatory and structural complexity. A quantitative analysis of hundreds of cell lines reveals that the transcriptional effect of an enhancer depends on its contact probabilities with the promoter through a nonlinear relationship. Mathematical modelling suggests that nonlinearity might arise from transient enhancer-promoter interactions being translated into slower promoter bursting dynamics in individual cells, therefore uncoupling the temporal dynamics of interactions from those of transcription. This uncovers a potential mechanism of how distal enhancers act from large genomic distances, and of how topologically associating domain boundaries block distal enhancers. Finally, we show that enhancer strength also determines absolute transcription levels as well as the sensitivity of a promoter to CTCF-mediated transcriptional insulation. Our measurements establish general principles for the context-dependent role of chromosome structure in long-range transcriptional regulation.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37858706": "Enhancers activate their cognate promoters over huge distances but how enhancer/promoter interactions become established is not completely understood. There is strong evidence that cohesin-mediated loop extrusion is involved but this does not appear to be a universal mechanism. Here, we identify an element within the mouse immunoglobulin lambda (Ig\u03bb) light chain locus, HSC\u03bb1, that has characteristics of active regulatory elements but lacks intrinsic enhancer or promoter activity. Remarkably, knock-out of the YY1 binding site from HSC\u03bb1 reduces Ig\u03bb transcription significantly and disrupts enhancer/promoter interactions, even though these elements are >10\u00a0kb from HSC\u03bb1. Genome-wide analyses of mouse embryonic stem cells identified 2671 similar YY1-bound, putative genome organizing elements that lie within CTCF/cohesin loop boundaries but that lack intrinsic enhancer activity. We suggest that such elements play a fundamental role in locus folding and in facilitating enhancer/promoter interactions.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37511131": "In higher eukaryotes, distance enhancer-promoter interactions are organized by topologically associated domains, tethering elements, and chromatin insulators/boundaries. While insulators/boundaries play a central role in chromosome organization, the mechanisms regulating their functions are largely unknown. In the studies reported here, we have taken advantage of the well-characterized Drosophila bithorax complex (BX-C) to study one potential mechanism for controlling boundary function. The regulatory domains of BX-C are flanked by boundaries, which block crosstalk with their neighboring domains and also support long-distance interactions between the regulatory domains and their target gene. As many lncRNAs have been found in BX-C, we asked whether readthrough transcription (RT) can impact boundary function. For this purpose, we took advantage of two BX-C boundary replacement platforms, Fab-7attP50 and F2attP, in which the Fab-7 and Fub boundaries, respectively, are deleted and replaced with an attP site. We introduced boundary elements, promoters, and polyadenylation signals arranged in different combinations and then assayed for boundary function. Our results show that RT can interfere with boundary activity. Since lncRNAs represent a significant fraction of Pol II transcripts in multicellular eukaryotes, it is therefore possible that RT may be a widely used mechanism to alter boundary function and regulation of gene expression.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35691341": "In mammalian organisms, enhancers can regulate transcription from great genomic distances. How enhancers affect distal gene expression has been a major question in the field of gene regulation. One model to explain how enhancers communicate with their target promoters, the chromatin looping model, posits that enhancers and promoters come in close spatial proximity to mediate communication. Chromatin looping has been broadly accepted as a means for enhancer-promoter communication, driven by accumulating in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo evidence. The genome is now known to be folded into a complex 3D arrangement, created and maintained in part by the interplay of the Cohesin complex and the DNA-binding protein CTCF. In the last few years, however, doubt over the relationship between looping and transcriptional activation has emerged, driven by studies finding that only a modest number of genes are perturbed with acute degradation of looping machinery components. In parallel, newer models describing distal enhancer action have also come to prominence. In this article, we explore the emergence and development of the looping model as a means for enhancer-promoter communication and review the contrasting evidence between historical gene-specific and current global data for the role of chromatin looping in transcriptional regulation. We also discuss evidence for alternative models to chromatin looping and their support in the literature. We suggest that, while there is abundant evidence for chromatin looping as a major mechanism for enhancer function, enhancer-promoter communication is likely mediated by more than one mechanism in an enhancer- and context-dependent manner.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36440509": "AIM: To estimate the global prevalence of intellectual developmental disorder (IDD) and the IDD prevalence-genotype association in Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) or Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) according to the affected isoforms of the DMD gene: Dp427, Dp140, Dp71.\nMETHOD: Systematic searches in MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library were conducted from inception of each database to March 2022.

The cause is unknown, and mortality is high.\nMETHODS: We evaluated four patients from three unrelated families with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance of DPM. Genomic sequencing independently identified three heterozygous variants in a specific region of the gene that encodes signal transducer and activator of transcription 4 (STAT4). Primary skin fibroblast and cell-line assays were used to define the functional nature of the genetic defect. We also assayed gene expression using single-cell RNA sequencing of peripheral-blood mononuclear cells to identify inflammatory pathways that may be affected in DPM and that may respond to therapy.\nRESULTS: Genome sequencing revealed three novel heterozygous missense gain-of-function variants in STAT4. In vitro, primary skin fibroblasts showed enhanced interleukin-6 secretion, with impaired wound healing, contraction of the collagen matrix, and matrix secretion. Inhibition of Janus kinase (JAK)-STAT signaling with ruxolitinib led to improvement in the hyperinflammatory fibroblast phenotype in vitro and resolution of inflammatory markers and clinical symptoms in treated patients, without adverse effects. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed expression patterns consistent with an immunodysregulatory phenotype that were appropriately modified through JAK inhibition.\nCONCLUSIONS: Gain-of-function variants in STAT4 caused DPM in the families that we studied.

Oxidized LDL displays proatherogenic activities through multiple and complex mechanisms which lead to dysfunctions of vascular cells (endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and macrophages). Oxidized LDLs are enriched in oxidized products of cholesterol called oxysterols formed either by autoxidation, enzymatically, or by both mechanisms. Several oxysterols have been shown to accumulate in atheroma plaques and to play a key role in atherogenesis. Depending on the type of oxysterols, various biological effects are exerted on vascular cells to regulate the formation of macrophage foam cells, endothelial integrity, adhesion and transmigration of monocytes, plaque progression, and instability. Most of these effects are linked to the ability of oxysterols to induce cellular oxidative stress and cytotoxicity mainly through apoptosis and proinflammatory mediators.

This article reviews the indications and most common surgical techniques for intestinal and multivisceral transplantations.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8632926": "OBJECTIVE: This report discusses the preliminary experience with intestinal transplantation in children at the University of Nebraska Medical Center.\nPATIENTS: During the past 4 years, 16 intestinal transplants have been performed in infants and children. Thirteen have been combined liver and bowel transplants, and the reminder were isolated intestinal transplants. Nearly half of the patients were younger than 1 year of age at the time of surgery, and the vast majority were younger than 5 years of age. All but one had short bowel syndrome.\nRESULTS: The 1-year actuarial patient and graft survival rates for recipients of liver and small bowel transplants were 76% and 61%, respectively. Eight of 13 patients who received liver and small bowel transplants remain alive at the time of this writing, with a mean length of follow-up of 263 (range, 7 to 1223) days. Six patients are currently free of total parenteral nutrition. All three patients receiving isolated intestinal transplants are alive and free of parenteral nutrition. The mean length of follow-up is 384 (range, 330 to 450) days. Major complications have included severe infections and rejection. Lymphoproliferative disease, graft-versus-host disease, and chylous ascites have not been major problems.\nCONCLUSIONS: Although intestinal transplantation is in its infancy, these preliminary results suggest combined liver and bowel transplants and isolated intestinal transplantation may be viable options for some patients with intestinal failure caused by short bowel syndrome or other gastrointestinal disease in whom long-term total parenteral nutrition is not an attractive option.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29528830": "Intestinal transplantation has evolved from its experimental origins in the mid-20th century to its status today as an established treatment option for patients with end-stage intestinal failure who cannot be sustained with total parenteral nutrition. The most common source of intestinal failure in both adults and children is short-bowel syndrome, but a host of other disease processes can lead to this common end-point. The development of intestinal transplantation has presented multiple hurdles for the transplant community, including technical challenges, immunologic pitfalls, and infectious complications. Despite these hurdles, the success rate has climbed over the past decades owing to achievements that include improved surgical techniques, new immunosuppressive regimens, and more effective strategies for posttransplant surveillance and management. Nearly 2800 intestinal transplants have been performed worldwide, and current patient and graft survival rates are now comparable to those of other types of solid organ transplantations. As their population continues to increase, it will be increasingly likely that intestinal-transplant patients will seek imaging at sites other than transplant centers. Therefore, it is important that diagnostic and interventional radiologists be familiar with the procedure, its common variations, and the spectrum of postoperative complications. In this article, the authors provide an overview of intestinal transplantation, including the indications, variations, expected postoperative anatomy, and range of potential complications. \u00a9RSNA, 2018.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10653004": "Glioblastomas develop de novo (primary glioblastomas) or through progression from low-grade or anaplastic astrocytoma (secondary glioblastomas). There is increasing evidence that these glioblastoma subtypes develop through different genetic pathways. Primary glioblastomas are characterized by EGFR and MDM2 amplification/overexpression, PTEN mutations, and p16 deletions, whereas secondary glioblastomas frequently contain p53 mutations. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on chromosome 10 (LOH#10) is the most frequent genetic alteration in glioblastomas; the involvement of tumor suppressor genes, other than PTEN, has been suggested. We carried out deletion mappings on chromosome 10, using PCR-based microsatellite analysis. LOH#10 was detected at similar frequencies in primary (8/17; 47%) and secondary glioblastomas (7/13; 54%). The majority (88%) of primary glioblastomas with LOH#10 showed LOH at all informative markers, suggesting loss of the entire chromosome 10. In contrast, secondary glioblastomas with LOH#10 showed partial or complete loss of chromosome 10q but no loss of 10p. These results are in accordance with the view that LOH on 10q is a major factor in the evolution of glioblastoma multiform as the common phenotypic end point of both genetic pathways, whereas LOH on 10p is largely restricted to the primary (de novo) glioblastoma.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1975510": "Astrocytoma, the most common brain tumor in humans, is usually malignant and virtually incurable. Two types of malignant astrocytomas can be distinguished histopathologically: anaplastic astrocytoma and glioblastoma multiforme. Studies using DNA markers that detect restriction fragment length polymorphisms have shown that loci on chromosomes 10 and 17p are lost frequently in tumor DNA from malignant astrocytoma patients, suggesting that tumor suppressor genes important in astrocytoma tumorigenesis may be present on 2 different chromosomes. To identify additional regions of chromosome loss, we carried out an allelotype analysis of 41 malignant astrocytoma patients using restriction fragment length polymorphism markers for each arm of every human autosome. Loss of heterozygosity was found for every autosome except chromosome 21, indicating an even greater complexity of genomic alterations than reported previously. Many tumors showed loss of heterozygosity for multiple chromosomes and the number of chromosomes involved correlated with tumor histopathology. A high-resolution restriction fragment length polymorphism study of chromosome 10 loci in these patients showed that loss of broad regions of chromosome 10 was a common event, particularly in glioblastoma multiforme. An allelotype analysis has been carried out on only one other tumor, human colorectal carcinoma. Different profiles of allele loss were observed in malignant astrocytoma and colorectal carcinoma, suggesting that the genetic events leading to these 2 human cancers may proceed along different pathways.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15924253": "Glioblastoma multiforme WHO grade IV is the most common and malignant variant of astrocytic tumors. Loss of heterozygosity of chromosome 10 and mutations in the tumor suppressor gene PTEN on 10q are molecular hallmarks of glioblastomas. Recently, mutations were identified in PIK3CA, encoding a protein that antagonizes the function of PTEN protein in the PI3K/Akt pathway. To address the question whether an exclusive mutation pattern can be observed in PIK3CA and PTEN, we determined the frequency of mutations in both genes. All coding exons were examined by single strand confirmation polymorphism and direct sequencing. Additionally, we analyzed chromosome 10 for loss of heterozygosity and evaluated the mutational status of TP53. In 70 glioblastomas, 5 (7%) PIK3CA mutations and 10 (14%) PTEN mutations were found. All mutations in PIK3CA located to exons 1, 9 and 20, thereby supporting the concept of mutational hot spot regions. In all but one glioblastoma, mutations were seen either in PIK3CA or in PTEN. In conclusion, the frequency of PIK3CA mutations in glioblastomas appears to be much lower than initially reported.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8370584": "A panel of glial tumors consisting of 11 low grade gliomas, 9 anaplastic gliomas, and 29 glioblastomas were analyzed for loss of heterozygosity by examining at least one locus for each chromosome. The frequency of allele loss was highest among the glioblastomas, suggesting that genetic alterations accumulate during glial tumor development. The most common genetic alteration detected involved allele losses of chromosome 10 loci; these losses were observed in all glioblastomas and in three of the anaplastic gliomas. In order to delineate which chromosome 10 region or regions were deleted in association with glial tumor development, a deletion mapping analysis was performed, and this revealed the partial loss of chromosome 10 in eight glioblastomas and two of the anaplastic gliomas. Among these cases, three distinct regions of chromosome 10 were indicated as being targeted for deletion: one telomeric region on 10p and both telomeric and centromeric locations on 10q. These data suggest the existence of multiple chromosome 10 tumor suppressor gene loci whose inactivation is involved in the malignant progression of glioma.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9690672": "Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on chromosome 10 is the most frequent genetic alteration associated with the evolution of malignant astrocytic tumors and it may involve several loci. The tumor suppressor gene PTEN (MMAC1) on chromosome 10q23 is mutated in approximately 30% of glioblastomas (WHO Grade IV). In this study, we assessed the frequency of PTEN mutations in primary glioblastomas, which developed clinically de novo, and in secondary glioblastomas, which evolved from low-grade (WHO Grade II) or anaplastic astrocytomas (WHO Grade III). Nine of 28 (32%) primary glioblastomas contained a PTEN mutation and an additional case showed a homozygous PTEN deletion. This indicates that after overexpression/amplification of the EGF receptor, loss of PTEN function is the most common alteration in primary glioblastomas. In this series, 5 of 28 (18%) primary glioblastomas showed both a PTEN mutation and EGFR amplification. In contrast, only 1 of 25 (4%) secondary glioblastomas contained a PTEN mutation, and none of them showed a homozygous PTEN deletion. The secondary glioblastoma with a PTEN mutation developed from an anaplastic astrocytoma that already carried the mutation. The observation that secondary glioblastomas have a p53 mutation as a genetic hallmark but rarely contain a PTEN mutation supports the concept that primary and secondary glioblastomas develop differently on a genetic level.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36658421": "Artificial intelligence has the potential to revolutionize healthcare, yet clinical trials in neurological diseases continue to rely on subjective, semiquantitative and motivation-dependent endpoints for drug development.

Movement behavior was assessed while the participant engaged in everyday activities using a 17-sensor bodysuit during three clinical visits over the course of 12 months. We first defined new movement behavioral fingerprints capable of distinguishing DMD from controls. Then, we used machine learning algorithms that combined the behavioral fingerprints to make cross-sectional and longitudinal disease course predictions, which outperformed predictions derived from currently used clinical assessments. Finally, using Bayesian optimization, we constructed a behavioral biomarker, termed the KineDMD ethomic biomarker, which is derived from daily-life behavioral data and whose value progresses with age in an S-shaped sigmoid curve form. The biomarker developed in this study, derived from digital readouts of daily-life movement behavior, can predict disease progression in patients with muscular dystrophy and can potentially track the response to therapy.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36373673": "PURPOSE: Myasthenia gravis (MG) is not commonly covered in pharmacy school curricula. However, many medications that have been reported to cause exacerbations of MG are among the top 200 most prescribed drugs. The purpose of this therapeutic update is to provide pharmacists with a general understanding of the pathophysiology and treatment of MG and describe common medications with the potential to cause new onset or acute worsening of this disease.\nSUMMARY: MG is an autoimmune disorder in which patients develop autoantibodies to a component of the neuromuscular junction, most frequently the acetylcholine receptor, resulting in impairment of skeletal muscle contraction. Although MG is not highly prevalent, there are up to 60,000 individuals with MG in the US, making it a disease that many pharmacists will likely encounter at least once in their career. Immunosuppressant medications and acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are the mainstays of treatment, although there is limited evidence as to which agents are most efficacious. Medications that activate the immune system, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors, may cause new onset of disease, while those with actions on the neuromuscular junction, such as macrolides and fluoroquinolones, can cause acute worsening of disease.\nCONCLUSION: MG, although not frequently covered in pharmacy school curricula, is a disease state for which it is not uncommon for pharmacists to provide care. Treatment tends to be patient specific, and evidence is often weak. Many medications that cause new onset or worsening of MG are among the most prescribed. Key classes of medications to use with caution include macrolides, fluoroquinolones, \u03b2-blockers, and magnesium.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33719062": "INTRODUCTION/AIMS: Anecdotal case reports have suggested a potential association of fluoroquinolones and macrolides with myasthenia gravis (MG) exacerbation, prompting warnings against the use of these drugs in this population. However, large-scale and reliable population-based data that demonstrate this association are lacking. This study aims to examine the association between outpatient treatment with fluoroquinolones or macrolides and MG-related hospitalization.\nMETHODS: A retrospective cohort study consisting of adult MG patients was conducted using a large de-identified healthcare claims database. Antibiotic prescription claims were identified, and MG-related hospitalizations were assessed at 15, 30, and 90\u2009days after the date of prescription. We used mixed effects survival regression with log-logistic distribution and independent covariance matrix to estimate odds ratios (ORs) of hospitalization for each potentially exacerbating antibiotic using beta-lactam as the reference and adjusting for covariates.\nRESULTS: Among 1556 MG patients receiving 894 fluoroquinolone prescriptions, 729 macrolide prescriptions, and 1608 beta-lactam prescriptions during the study period, there was no difference in 15, 30, or 90-day odds of MG-related hospitalization between fluoroquinolone or macrolide users compared to prescribed beta-lactams. However, estimates were higher for fluoroquinolones than macrolides, even after covariate adjustment (adjusted OR [aOR] 4.60, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.55-38.57 for fluoroquinolones and OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.32-0.97 for macrolides, respectively, at 15\u2009days).\nDISCUSSION: Fluoroquinolone and macrolide antibiotics are prescribed frequently to patients with MG. While statistical imprecision precludes a definitive conclusion, elevated ORs for fluoroquinolones raise the possibility of an underpowered association that merits further investigation.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32922263": "Myasthenic syndromes are typically characterized by muscle weakness and increased fatigability due to an impaired transmission at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Most cases are caused by acquired autoimmune conditions such as myasthenia gravis (MG), typically with antibodies against the acetylcholine receptor (AChR). Different drugs are among the major factors that may complicate pre-existing autoimmune myasthenic conditions by further impairing transmission at the NMJ. Some clinical observations are substantiated by experimental data, indicating that presynaptic, postsynaptic or more complex pathomechanisms at the NMJ may be involved, depending on the individual compound. Most robust data exist for the risks associated with some antibiotics (e.g., aminoglycosides, ketolides, fluoroquinolones) and cardiovascular medications (e.g., class Ia antiarrhythmics, beta blockers). Apart from primarily autoimmune-mediated disorders of the NMJ, de novo myasthenic manifestations may also be triggered by medical treatments that induce an autoimmune reaction. Most notably, there is growing evidence that the immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), a modern class of drugs to treat various malignancies, represent a relevant risk factor to develop severe and progressive medication-induced myasthenia via an immune-mediated mechanism. From a clinical perspective, it is of utmost importance for the treating physicians to be aware of such adverse treatment effects and their consequences.

In microsatellite-stable tumors, this mutation was related to poor survival, CIMP high, advanced American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage, and family history of colorectal cancer [odds ratio, 4.23; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.65-10.84]. The poor survival was observed in a univariate analysis of 5-year survival (16.7% versus 60.0%; P < 0.01); in an analysis adjusted for age, stage, and tumor site [hazard rate ratio (HRR), 2.97; 95% CI, 2.05-4.32]; in stage-specific, age-adjusted analyses for AJCC stages 2 to 4 (HRR, 4.88, 3.60, and 2.04, respectively); and in Kaplan-Meier survival estimates for AJCC stages 2 to 4 (P < 0.01 for all three stages). Microsatellite-unstable tumors were associated with an excellent 5-year survival whether the V600E mutation was present or absent (76.2% and 75.0%, respectively).

Therefore, efficient neoepitope screening technology is an essential step in the development of personalized vaccines.

So far, various circRNAs have been poorly characterized, though new evidence suggests that a few translated circRNAs may play a role in cancer. In the present study, circRNA was used as a source of neoepitope, a novel strategy as circRNA-derived neoepitopes have never been previously explored. The present study reports CIRC_neo (circRNA-derived neoepitope prediction pipeline), which is a comprehensive and automated bioinformatic pipeline for the prediction of circRNA-derived neoepitopes from RNA sequencing data.

The present study proposes a novel source of neoepitopes. The study focused on cancer-specific circRNAs, which have greatly expanded the source pool for neoepitope discovery. The statistical analysis of different features of circRNA-derived neoepitopes revealed that circRNAs could produce long proteins or truncated proteins. Because the peptides were completely foreign to the human body, they could be highly immunogenic. Importantly, circRNA-derived neoepitopes capable of binding to HLA were discovered.

The expression level of circLSD1-RNAs was then studied by quantitative PCR on cellular and extracellular fractions of lung cancer (PC9) and non-cancer primary small airway epithelial (PSAE) cells. Moreover, we established the transgenic overexpression of circLSD1-RNAs. We show that circLSD1-RNAs are primarily located in the cytoplasm, but are packaged and released from lung cancer and non-cancer cells by extracellular vesicles (EVs) and ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes, respectively. Proteomics demonstrated a different protein pattern of EV fractions released from PC9 versus PSAE cells. Importantly, released circLSD1-RNAs were differently taken up by PSAE and PC9 cells. In conclusion, our findings provide primary evidence that circLSD1-RNAs participate in the intercellular communication of lung cancer cells with the tumor environment.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33634138": "Lung cancer is the most prevalent cancer globally. It is also the leading cause of cancer-related death because of the late diagnosis and the frequent resistance to therapeutics. Therefore, it is impending to identify novel biomarkers and effective therapeutic targets to improve the clinical outcomes. Identified as a new class of RNAs, circular RNAs (circRNAs) derive from pre-mRNA back splicing with considerable stability and conservation. Accumulating research reveal that circRNAs can function as microRNA (miRNA) sponges, regulators of gene transcription and alternative splicing, as well as interact with RNA-binding proteins (RBPs), or even be translated into proteins directly. Currently, a large body of circRNAs have been demonstrated differentially expressed in physiological and pathological processes including cancer. In lung cancer, circRNAs play multiple roles in carcinogenesis, development, and response to different therapies, indicating their potential as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers as well as novel therapeutics. In this review, we summarize the multi-faceted functions of circRNAs in lung cancer and the underlying mechanisms, together with the possible future of these discoveries in clinical application.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32972011": "Most of the circRNAs reported to date originate from back splicing of a pre-mRNA, and these exonic circRNAs are termed canonical circRNAs. Our objective was to provide an overview of all other (non-canonical) circRNAs that do not originate from the junction of two exons and to characterize their common properties. Those generated through a failure of intron lariat debranching are the best known, even though studies on them are rare. These circRNAs retain the 2'-5' bond derived from the intron lariat, and this feature probably explains the difficulties in obtaining efficient reverse transcription through the circular junction. Here, we provide an unprecedented overview of non-canonical circRNAs (lariat-derived intronic circRNAs, sub-exonic circRNAs, intron circles, tricRNAs), which all derive from non-coding sequences. As there are few data suggesting their involvement in cellular regulatory processes, we believe that it is early to propose a general function for circRNAs, even for lariat-derived circRNAs. We suggest that their small size and probably strong secondary structures could be major obstacles to their reliable detection. Nevertheless, we believe there are still several possible ways to advance our knowledge of this class of non-coding RNA.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29567830": "Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a relatively new class of RNA molecules, and knowledge about their biogenesis and function is still in its infancy. It was recently shown that alternative splicing underlies the formation of circular RNAs (circRNA) arising from the Titin (TTN) gene. Since the main mechanism by which circRNAs are formed is still unclear, we hypothesized that alternative splicing, and in particular exon skipping, is a major driver of circRNA production. We performed RNA sequencing on human and mouse hearts, mapped alternative splicing events, and overlaid these with expressed circRNAs at exon-level resolution. In addition, we performed RNA sequencing on hearts of Rbm20 KO mice to address how important Rbm20-mediated alternative splicing is in the production of cardiac circRNAs. In human and mouse hearts, we show that cardiac circRNAs are mostly (\u223c90%) produced from constitutive exons and less (\u223c10%) from alternatively spliced exons. In Rbm20 KO hearts, we identified 38 differentially expressed circRNAs of which 12 were produced from the Ttn gene. Even though Ttn appeared the most prominent target of Rbm20 for circularization, we also detected Rbm20-dependent circRNAs arising from other genes including Fan1, Stk39, Xdh, Bcl2l13, and Sorbs1 Interestingly, only Ttn circRNAs seemed to arise from Rbm20-mediated skipped exons. In conclusion, cardiac circRNAs are mostly derived from constitutive exons, suggesting that these circRNAs are generated at the expense of their linear counterpart and that circRNA production impacts the accumulation of the linear mRNA.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37367977": "IMPORTANCE: Prior studies have suggested that transgender individuals may be a high-risk group with respect to suicide attempt and mortality, but large-scale, population-based investigations are lacking.\nOBJECTIVE: To examine in a national setting whether transgender individuals have higher rates of suicide attempt and mortality than nontransgender individuals.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Nationwide, register-based, retrospective cohort study on all 6\u202f657\u202f456 Danish-born individuals aged 15 years or older who lived in Denmark between January 1, 1980, and December 31, 2021.\nEXPOSURE: Transgender identity was determined through national hospital records and administrative records of legal change of gender.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Suicide attempts, suicide deaths, nonsuicidal deaths, and deaths by any cause during 1980 through 2021 were identified in national hospitalization and causes of death registers.

Nowadays, one of the most frequently studied molecules with important implications in the pathogenesis of the classical subtype of GBM is the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Although many clinical trials aiming to study EGFR targeted therapies have been performed, none of them have reported promising clinical results when used in glioma patients. The resistance of GBM to these therapies was proven to be both acquired and innate, and it seems to be influenced by a cumulus of factors such as ineffective blood-brain barrier penetration, mutations, heterogeneity and compensatory signaling pathways. Recently, it was shown that EGFR possesses kinase-independent (KID) pro-survival functions in cancer cells. It seems imperative to understand how the EGFR signaling pathways function and how they interconnect with other pathways. Furthermore, it is important to identify the mechanisms of drug resistance and to develop better tailored therapeutic agents.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33435537": "Nowadays, due to recent advances in molecular biology, the pathogenesis of glioblastoma is better understood. For the newly diagnosed, the current standard of care is represented by resection followed by radiotherapy and temozolomide administration, but because median overall survival remains poor, new diagnosis and treatment strategies are needed.

It is known that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) amplification is a characteristic of the classical subtype of glioma. However, targeted therapies against this type of receptor have not yet shown a clear clinical benefit. Many factors contribute to resistance, such as ineffective blood-brain barrier penetration, heterogeneity, mutations, as well as compensatory signaling pathways.

Since different alterations underlie different molecular glioblastoma subtypes it is commonly expected that tumors induced by specific alterations represent models of the corresponding subtypes. We tested this assumption by a multilevel analysis ranging from a detailed histopathological analysis to a genome-wide expression profiling by microarray and RNA-seq on gliomas induced by two distinct molecular alterations: the overstimulation of the PDGF- and the EGF- pathways. These alterations are landmarks of proneural and classical glioblastoma subtypes respectively. However, our results consistently showed a strong similarity between the two glioma models. The expression profiles of both models converged toward a signature typical of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, regardless the wide differentiative potential of the cell of origin. A classification based on similarity with human gliomas profiles revealed that both models belong to the proneural subtype.

To better understand the genetic underpinnings of this morphologic entity, we performed a genome-wide, integrated copy number, mutational and transcriptomic analysis of eight (seven primary, primary secondary) cases.\nRESULTS: Three GBM-O samples had IDH1 (p.R132H) mutations; two of these also demonstrated 1p/19q co-deletion and had a proneural transcriptional profile, a molecular signature characteristic of oligodendroglioma. The additional IDH1 mutant tumor lacked 1p/19q co-deletion, harbored a TP53 mutation, and overall, demonstrated features most consistent with IDH mutant (secondary) GBM. Finally, five tumors were IDH wild-type (IDHwt) and had chromosome seven gains, chromosome 10 losses, and homozygous 9p deletions (CDKN2A), alterations typical of IDHwt (primary) GBM. IDHwt GBM-Os also demonstrated EGFR and PDGFRA amplifications, which correlated with classical and proneural expression subtypes, respectively.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that GBM-O is composed of three discrete molecular subgroups with characteristic mutations, copy number alterations and gene expression patterns. Despite displaying areas that morphologically resemble oligodendroglioma, the current results indicate that morphologically defined GBM-O does not correspond to a particular genetic signature, but rather represents a collection of genetically dissimilar entities.

Ambulant patients were subdivided according to the ability to walk: >350, 250-350, \u2264250 meters.

The primary objectives of phase 1 (dose-escalation cohort) were to assess safety and pharmacokinetics and to identify the dose and schedule for phase 2. In phase 2 (dose-expansion cohort), objectives included the assessment of the overall response (partial response or better), safety, and efficacy of mezigdomide plus dexamethasone at the dose and schedule determined in phase 1.\nRESULTS: In phase 1, a total of 77 patients were enrolled in the study. The most common dose-limiting toxic effects were neutropenia and febrile neutropenia. On the basis of the phase 1 findings, investigators determined the recommended phase 2 dose of mezigdomide to be 1.0 mg, given once daily in combination with dexamethasone for 21 days, followed by 7 days off, in each 28-day cycle.

The mTOR pathway, particularly mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1), has been shown to control aging, lifespan, and healthspan through the regulation of protein synthesis, autophagy, mitochondrial function, and metabolic health. The mTOR pathway also plays critical roles in the heart, from cardiac development, growth and maturation, and maintenance of cardiac homeostasis. Hyperactivation of mTORC1 signaling is well documented in aging and many age-related pathologies, including age-related cardiac dysfunction and heart failure. Suppression of mTORC1 by calorie restriction or rapamycin not only extends lifespan but also restores youthful phenotypes in the heart. In this article, we review model organisms of cardiac aging and highlight recent advances in the impact of the mTORC1 pathway on organismal and cardiac aging, particularly in Drosophila and mice. We focus on the downstream signaling pathways S6 kinase and 4EBP1, which regulates protein synthesis, as well as ULK1 and its related pathway that regulates autophagy.

In response to insulin and nutrients, mTORC1, consisting of mTOR, raptor (regulatory-associated protein of mTOR), and mLST8, is activated and phosphorylates eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein (4EBP) and p70 S6 kinase to promote protein synthesis and cell size. Previously we found that activation of mTOR kinase in response to insulin was associated with increased 4EBP1 binding to raptor. Here we identify prolinerich Akt substrate 40 (PRAS40) as a binding partner for mTORC1. A putative TOR signaling motif, FVMDE, is identified in PRAS40 and shown to be required for interaction with raptor. Insulin stimulation markedly decreases the level of PRAS40 bound by mTORC1. Recombinant PRAS40 inhibits mTORC1 kinase activity in vivo and in vitro, and this inhibition depends on PRAS40 association with raptor. Furthermore, decreasing PRAS40 expression by short hairpin RNA enhances 4E-BP1 binding to raptor, and recombinant PRAS40 competes with 4E-BP1 binding to raptor. We, therefore, propose that PRAS40 regulates mTORC1 kinase activity by functioning as a direct inhibitor of substrate binding.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21576368": "The mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) functions as an environmental sensor to promote critical cellular processes such as protein synthesis, cell growth, and cell proliferation in response to growth factors and nutrients.

By employing mass spectrometry and phospho-specific antibodies, we demonstrated novel phosphorylation on S2159 and T2164 within the mTOR kinase domain. Mutational analysis of these phosphorylation sites indicates that dual S2159/T2164 phosphorylation cooperatively promotes mTORC1 signaling to S6K1 and 4EBP1.

Active PKN2 phosphorylates PI3KC2-\u03b2 to trigger PI3KC2-\u03b2 complex formation with inhibitory 14-3-3 proteins. Conversely, loss of PKN2 or inactivation of its target phosphorylation site in PI3KC2-\u03b2 represses nutrient signalling via mTORC1.

These patients were classified as statin users and nonusers. Propensity score matching was performed to balance selected confounders between the statin users and nonusers. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to evaluate the association between statin use and the risk of dementia.\nRESULTS: During the follow-up period (median, 7.5 years), 1895 patients were diagnosed with incident dementia.

Unlike several other types of cancer, PCa has few genetic drivers, which has led researchers to look for additional epigenetic and transcriptomic contributors to PCa development and progression. Especially datasets on DNA methylation, the most commonly studied epigenetic marker, have recently been measured and analysed in several PCa patient cohorts. DNA methylation is most commonly associated with downregulation of gene expression. However, positive associations of DNA methylation to gene expression have also been reported, suggesting a more diverse mechanism of epigenetic regulation. Such additional complexity could have important implications for understanding prostate cancer development but has not been studied at a genome-wide scale.\nRESULTS: In this study, we have compared three sets of genome-wide single-site DNA methylation data from 870 PCa and normal tissue samples with multi-cohort gene expression data from 1117 samples, including 532 samples where DNA methylation and gene expression have been measured on the exact same samples. Genes were classified according to their corresponding methylation and expression profiles. A large group of hypermethylated genes was robustly associated with increased gene expression (UPUP group) in all three methylation datasets. These genes demonstrated distinct patterns of correlation between DNA methylation and gene expression compared to the genes showing the canonical negative association between methylation and expression (UPDOWN group). This indicates a more diversified role of DNA methylation in regulating gene expression than previously appreciated. Moreover, UPUP and UPDOWN genes were associated with different compartments - UPUP genes were related to the structures in nucleus, while UPDOWN genes were linked to extracellular features.\nCONCLUSION: We identified a robust association between hypermethylation and upregulation of gene expression when comparing samples from prostate cancer and normal tissue.

The emerging picture is that the function of DNA methylation seems to vary with context, and the relationship between DNA methylation and transcription is more nuanced than we realized at first. Improving our understanding of the functions of DNA methylation is necessary for interpreting changes in this mark that are observed in diseases such as cancer.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29958539": "BACKGROUND: DNA methylation is one of the main epigenetic mechanisms for the regulation of gene expression in eukaryotes. In the standard model, methylation in gene promoters has received the most attention since it is generally associated with transcriptional silencing. Nevertheless, recent studies in human tissues reveal that methylation of the region downstream of the transcription start site is highly informative of gene expression. Also, in some cell types and specific genes it has been found that methylation of the first intron, a gene feature typically rich in enhancers, is linked with gene expression. However, a genome-wide, tissue-independent, systematic comparative analysis of the relationship between DNA methylation in the first intron and gene expression across vertebrates has not been explored yet.\nRESULTS: The most important findings of this study are: (1) using different tissues from a modern fish, we show a clear genome-wide, tissue-independent quasi-linear inverse relationship between DNA methylation of the first intron and gene expression. (2) This relationship is conserved across vertebrates, since it is also present in the genomes of a model pufferfish, a model frog and different human tissues. Among the gene features, tissues and species interrogated, the first intron's negative correlation with the gene expression was most consistent. (3) We identified more tissue-specific differentially methylated regions (tDMRs) in the first intron than in any other gene feature. These tDMRs have positive or negative correlation with gene expression, indicative of distinct mechanisms of tissue-specific regulation. (4) Lastly, we identified CpGs in transcription factor binding motifs, enriched in the first intron, the methylation of which tended to increase with the distance from the first exon-first intron boundary, with a concomitant decrease in gene expression.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our integrative analysis clearly reveals the important and conserved role of the methylation level of the\u00a0first intron and its inverse association with gene expression regardless of tissue and species.

However, growing evidence suggests that this association may not always hold true, and promoter hypermethylation now also appears to be associated with high transcriptional activity. Furthermore, in a selection of contexts, increasing levels of promoter methylation correlate directly with increased gene expression. These findings postulate a context-dependent model whereby epigenetic contributions to transcriptional regulation occur in a more complex and dynamic manner.

However, the results of genome-wide studies of the DNA methylation pattern and transcriptional activity of genes have nudged us toward reconsidering this paradigm, since the promoters of many genes remain active despite their methylation. The differences in the DNA methylation distribution in normal and pathological conditions allow us to consider methylation as a diagnostic marker or a therapy target. In this regard, the need to investigate the factors affecting DNA methylation and those involved in its interpretation becomes pressing. Recently, a large number of protein factors have been uncovered, whose ability to bind to DNA depends on their methylation. Many of these proteins act not only as transcriptional activators or repressors, but also affect the level of DNA methylation. These factors are considered potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of diseases resulting from either a change in DNA methylation or a change in the interpretation of its methylation level. In addition to protein factors, a secondary DNA structure can also affect its methylation and can be considered as a therapy target.

Time with Glucose in Range (MD 6.60% CI 3.63 to 9.57%; P < 0.0001) and Insulin Dose Difference (MD 0.97UI CI 0.76 to 1.18UI; P < 0.0001) were higher in the Icodec group. There was no significant difference in fasting plasma glucose, body weight change, hypoglycemia or any adverse event evaluated.\nCONCLUSION: OnceWeekly Insulin Icodec was associated with a small reduction in Glycated Hemoglobin, as well as higher Time with Glucose in Range, with similar hypoglycemic adverse events, when compared with Once-Daily Insulin Glargine U100.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33944562": "Here, we describe the molecular engineering of insulin icodec to achieve a plasma half-life of 196 h in humans, suitable for once-weekly subcutaneously administration. Insulin icodec is based on re-engineering of the ultra-long oral basal insulin OI338 with a plasma half-life of 70 h in humans. This systematic re-engineering was accomplished by (1) further increasing the albumin binding by changing the fatty diacid from a 1,18-octadecanedioic acid (C18) to a 1,20-icosanedioic acid (C20) and (2) further reducing the insulin receptor affinity by the B16Tyr \u2192 His substitution. Insulin icodec was selected by screening for long intravenous plasma half-life in dogs while ensuring glucose-lowering potency following subcutaneous administration in rats. The ensuing structure-activity relationship resulted in insulin icodec. In phase-2 clinical trial, once-weekly insulin icodec provided safe and efficacious glycemic control comparable to once-daily insulin glargine in type 2 diabetes patients. The structure-activity relationship study leading to insulin icodec is presented here.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36110513": "Background: Metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) imposes a heavy tumor burden worldwide due to limited availability of therapeutic drugs. Aflibercept, a kind of recombinant protein of the anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family, has been approved in clinical application among mCRC patients since 2012. A comprehensive analysis of the efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness of aflibercept in mCRC treatment is necessary. Objective: To evaluate the efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness of aflibercept for the treatment of mCRC in order to provide a decision-making reference for the selection of targeted drugs for second-line treatment of mCRC in Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan regions of China and the selection of new drugs for medical institutions in these regions. Methods: A systematic retrieve on databases including PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang, and Weipu, as well as relevant websites and databases of health technology assessment including the National Institute of Health and Clinical Optimization, Centre for Evaluation and Communication at the University of York, and the Canadian Agency for Medicines and Health Technology, was conducted. The literature was screened according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and data were extracted and analyzed by two authors, while the quality of the literature was assessed. Results: Finally, we included two HTA reports, 11 systematic reviews/meta-analyses, and two cost-effectiveness studies in the rapid health technology assessment. For mCRC patients receiving second-line treatment, aflibercept combined with FOLFIRI significantly increased progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) and the objective response rate (ORR) also improved, compared with folinic acid + fluorouracil + irinotecan (FOLFIRI). In terms of safety, mCRC patients who received aflibercept combined with FOLFIRI therapy had a higher incidence of grade 3-4 adverse events than those who received FOLFIRI alone, including anti-VEGF-related adverse events (hypertension, hemorrhagic events, and proteinuria) and chemotherapy-related adverse events (diarrhea, weakness, stomatitis, hand-foot syndrome, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia). In terms of cost-effectiveness, two economic studies conducted in the United Kingdom and Japan, respectively, found that compared with FOLFIRI, aflibercept combined with FOLFIRI had no cost-effectiveness advantage in mCRC patients receiving second-line treatment. Conclusion: Compared with FOLFIRI treatment, aflibercept combined with FOLFIRI for the second-line treatment of mCRC patients has better efficacy, worse safety, and is not cost-effective. More high-quality clinical studies are required for further exploration of aflibercept's clinical value.

The Centre for Reviews and Dissemination and Centre for Health Economics at the University of York were commissioned to act as the independent Evidence Review Group (ERG). This article provides a description of the company submission, the ERG review and the resulting NICE guidance TA307 issued in March 2014. The ERG critically reviewed the evidence presented in the manufacturer's submission and identified areas requiring clarification, for which the manufacturer provided additional evidence. The clinical effectiveness data were derived from one good-quality double-blind randomised controlled trial (RCT), the VELOUR trial, which compared aflibercept plus FOLFIRI with placebo plus FOLFIRI. This RCT found a small but statistically significant increase in overall survival (OS); the difference in median OS was 1.44 months (13.5 months in the aflibercept group and 12.06 months in the placebo group). There was also a statistically significant increase in progression-free survival (PFS) with aflibercept; the difference in median PFS was 2.23 months (6.9 months in the aflibercept group and 4.67 months in the placebo group). However, grade 3-4 adverse events were more frequent in the aflibercept group than the placebo group: 83.5% compared with 62.5%. Treatment-emergent adverse events led to permanent discontinuation of treatment in 26.8% of patients in the aflibercept group and 12.1% of patients in the placebo group. The manufacturer's submission included an estimation of mean OS benefit based on extrapolation of the data, which was considerably longer than the median OS benefit reported (4.7 vs. 1.44 months). The ERG considered this to be an over estimate. The base-case incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for the overall population was reported by the manufacturer to be \u00a336,294 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY). After correcting the model programming and updating the model to include the ERG's preferred parameter estimates, the ICER from the ERG's alternative base case was \u00a354,368 per QALY. The extrapolation of the OS curves was the key cost-effectiveness driver and a major source of uncertainty in the model. Additional scenarios related to the extrapolation of OS undertaken by the ERG resulted in ICERs between \u00a362,894 and \u00a392,089 per QALY. After consideration of the manufacturer's submission and the ERG's critique, and submissions from other stakeholders, the NICE Appraisal Committee concluded that aflibercept in combination with irinotecan and fluorouracil-based therapy could not be considered a cost effective use of National Health Service resources for treating metastatic colorectal cancer that is resistant to or has progressed after an oxaliplatin-containing regimen. Aflibercept in combination with irinotecan and fluorouracil-based therapy is not recommended for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer that is resistant to or has progressed after an oxaliplatin-containing regimen in NICE guidance TA307.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32616433": "PURPOSE: The addition of aflibercept (AFL) or ramucirumab (RAM) to folinic acid, fluorouracil, and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) prolongs overall survival and progression-free survival compared with FOLFIRI alone in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) as second-line therapy. Although these combination regimens are recommended among the standard therapies, significant additional cost is a concern. The comparative cost-effectiveness of AFL and RAM was examined from the perspective of the Japanese health care payer.\nMETHODS: A partitioned survival analysis was constructed. The data sources were the VELOUR (Aflibercept Versus Placebo in Combination With Irinotecan and 5-FU in the Treatment of Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer After Failure of an Oxaliplatin Based Regimen) and RAISE (Ramucirumab Versus Placebo in Combination With Second-Line FOLFIRI in Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Carcinoma That Progressed During or After First-Line Therapy With Bevacizumab, Oxaliplatin, and a Fluoropyrimidine) trials, which compared FOLFIRI alone with AFL or RAM in second-line treatment for mCRC. The cost and effectiveness of the combination of AFL or RAM with FOLFIRI were compared with those of FOLFIRI alone and examined between both agents in a 10-year time horizon. The health outcomes were life-years (LYs) and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The costs were 2019 revisions to the drug prices and medical fees. The robustness of the model was verified by 1-way sensitivity analyses and a probability sensitivity analysis. A 2% annual discount was applied to the expenses and QALYs. A willingness-to-pay threshold of \u00a57.5 million was used.\nFINDINGS: Compared with FOLFIRI alone, combination AFL or RAM with FOLFIRI had incremental effects of 0.173 QALYs (0.253 LYs) and 0.137 QALYs (0.197 LYs), incremental costs of \u00a53,423,481 (US $31,010) and \u00a55,766,106 (US $52,229), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of \u00a519, 836, 504 (US $179,678) and \u00a541, 947, 989 (US $379,964) per QALY, respectively. Results of 1-way sensitivity analyses and probability sensitivity analysis all exceeded a willingness-to-pay threshold of \u00a57.5 million. In the comparison of the 2 agents, AFL was a dominant over RAM.\nIMPLICATIONS: Adding AFL or RAM to FOLFIRI in the second line of mCRC treatment was not cost-effective in the Japanese health care system. On the basis of the results of this study, in the treatment of mCRC, it will be necessary to adjust the prices of AFL and RAM with the improvement of clinical parameters, such as survival time and adverse events.

Transition to health state \u00abprogression\u00bb implied the interruption of second-line treatment and administration of a third-line treatment (post-second line chemotherapy). Cost estimation included disease management cost (pharmaceutical, adverse event management, administration costs, etc.). Both cost and outcomes were discounted (3% annually). Sensitivity analyses (SA) were performed to test model robustness.\nRESULTS: Administration of aflibercept + FOLFIRI as second-line treatment provided 1.78 LYG (21 life-months gained). With FOLFIRI 1.43 LYG (17 months) were obtained. The cost of the clinical management of aflibercept + FOLFIRI implied an additional investment of Euros 13,564 compared with FOLFIRI for a lifetime horizon, being total costs for aflibercept + FOLFIRI of Euros 38,346, compared to Euros 24,782 with FOLFIRI. In the cost-effectiveness analysis Euros 38,931/LYG was obtained with aflibercept in combination with FOLFIRI versus FOLFIRI.\nCONCLUSION: Aflibercept in combination with FOLFIRI increased overall survival versus FOLFIRI, so it is an effective strategy in the treatment of patients with mCRC.

In particular, the introduction of active new anti-angiogenic agents for the second-line treatment of metastatic CRC (mCRC) is associated with a relevant increase of costs, and it is therefore important to make a balance between the costs of treatment and the added value represented by the improvement of the clinical parameters of interest such as progression-free survival (PFS).\nMETHODS: The analysis was conducted to assess the effect of second-line therapy with anti-angiogenic agents on the PFS and was restricted to pivotal phase III randomized controlled trials (RCTs).\nRESULTS: The present analysis evaluated four phase III RCTs, including 3938 patients. Dividing the costs of therapy by the measure of efficacy represented by PFS, we found out that the lowest cost per month of PFS gained (4581 \u20ac) was associated with the use of FOLFIRI plus aflibercept.\nCONCLUSIONS: Combining pharmacological costs of drugs with the measure of efficacy represented by the PFS, aflibercept in combination with FOLFIRI is a cost-effective second-line treatment for patients with mCRC.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37047734": "Bone marrow edema (BME), also termed bone marrow lesions, is a syndrome characterized by bone pain and the appearance of high signal intensity on T2 fat-suppressed and short tau inversion recovery (STIR) MRI sequences. BME can be related to trauma or a variety of non-traumatic diseases, and current treatment modalities include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), bisphosphonates, denosumab, extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT), the vasoactive prostacyclin analogue iloprost, and surgical decompression. Spontaneous BME is a subset that has been observed with no apparent causative conditions. It is most likely caused by venous outflow obstruction and intraosseous hypertension. These are mechanistically related to impaired perfusion and ischemia in several models of BME and are related to bone remodeling. The association of perfusion abnormalities and bone pain provides the pathophysiological rationale for surgical decompression. We present a case of spontaneous BME and a second case of spontaneous migratory BME treated with surgical decompression and demonstrate resolution of pain and the high signal intensity on MRI. This report provides an integration of the clinical syndrome, MR imaging characteristics, circulatory pathophysiology, and treatment.

Methods The data of 54 patients with bone marrow edema syndrome treated with a single dose of intravenous zoledronic acid and partial weight-bearing were included in the study. The diagnosis was based on clinical examination, the existence of prolonged pain, the presence of bone marrow edema on magnetic resonance imaging, and the patient's medical history. The efficacy was assessed using changes in symptoms, visual analogue scale, and changes in magnetic resonance imaging. Results Overall, 54 patients (35.2% male) were included with bone marrow edema syndrome, with a mean age of 52.7 \u00b1 9.77 years (range: 35 - 74 years). The most commonly affected joint was the knee in 32 patients (59.2%), followed by the foot/ankle in 13 patients (24.1%), and the hip in nine patients (16.7%). Improved mobility was reported by 29 patients (53.7%) among the total number of the patients at the six-month\u00a0follow-up visit.

Atraumatic/ischemic BME is inconsistently described as a separate entity or as a reversible preliminary stage of osteonecrosis (ON). However, there is always the risk of transformation of BME into ON and subsequent joint destruction. The most common sites of BME are the hip, knee, and ankle. Magnetic resonance imaging is the diagnostic gold standard. Differential diagnoses of the transient BME as osteonecrosis, osteochondrosis dissecans, and a reflex dystrophy should be considered. Conservative or surgical treatment is considered, depending on the etiology of BME. BME syndrome is generally treated conservatively.

Post-SA medical care mainly focuses on injuries, sexually transmitted infection (STI) prevention and detection, as well as preventing unwanted pregnancies. Swift access to post-SA medical care is vital with sexual assault treatment units (SATUs) streamlining this care. The primary aim of our study is to report on post-SA care provided at the national SATU network in Ireland with a secondary aim of analysing factors associated with follow-up attendance for STI testing.\nMETHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of all acute attendances (<7\u2009days from incident) at the national SATU network between 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2022.\nRESULTS: A total of 4159 acute cases presented during the study period. Emergency contraception (EC) was administered to 53.8% (n=1899/3529) of cases, while postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) for chlamydia was given in 75.1% (n=3124/4159) and for HIV in 11.0% (n=304/3387). Hepatitis B vaccination was initiated in 53.7% (n=2233/4159) of cases. 1.4% (n=59/4159) of the attendees were referred to an emergency department for the treatment of injuries. Follow-up appointments were scheduled for 75.8% (3151/4159) of acute cases. 71.6% (n=2257/3151) attended follow-up.Certain factors were found to correlate with a higher likelihood of attending follow-up appointments: adolescents (p<0.0001), concern about drug-facilitated SA (DFSA) (p=0.01), no consumption of recreational drugs before the incident (p<0.0001), alcohol consumption prior to the incident (p=0.01), and not reporting the crime to the police (p<0.001). However, gender (p=0.06) and the presence of injury at time of primary attendance (p=0.97) were not predictive of likelihood of follow-up attendance.\nCONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that EC, chlamydia PEP, HIV PEP and hepatitis B vaccination were all administered at SATU.

In order to create new therapeutic strategies, it is imperative to have a better understanding of the mechanisms behind tumor growth and invasion. The continuous cross-talk between glioma stem cells (GSCs) and the tumor microenvironment (TME) contributes to disease progression, which renders research in this field difficult and challenging. The main aim of the review was to assess the different possible mechanisms that could explain resistance to treatment promoted by TME and GSCs in glioblastoma, including the role of M2 macrophages, micro RNAs (miRNAs), and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) from exosomes from the TME. A systematic review of the literature on the role of the TME in developing and promoting radioresistance and chemoresistance of GBM was performed according to PRISMA-P (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols) guidelines. A dedicated literature review search was also performed on the immunotherapeutic agents against the immune TME. We identified 367 papers using the reported keywords. The final qualitative analysis was conducted on 25 studies. A growing amount of evidence in the current literature supports the role of M2 macrophages and non-coding RNAs in promoting the mechanisms of chemo and radioresistance. A better insight into how GBM cells interact with TME is an essential step towards comprehending the mechanisms that give rise to resistance to standard treatment, which can help to pave the way for the development of novel therapeutic strategies for GBM patients.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36968288": "Glioblastoma (GBM) tumor microenvironment (TME) is a highly heterogeneous and complex system, which in addition to cancer cells, consists of various resident brain and immune cells as well as cells in transit through the tumor such as marrow-derived immune cells. The TME is a dynamic environment which is heavily influenced by alterations in cellular composition, cell-to-cell contact and cellular metabolic products as well as other chemical factors, such as pH and oxygen levels. Emerging evidence suggests that GBM cells appear to reprogram their the TME, and hijack microenvironmental elements to facilitate rapid proliferation, invasion, migration, and survival thus generating treatment resistance. GBM cells interact with their microenvironment directly through cell-to-cell by interaction mediated by cell-surface molecules, or indirectly through apocrine or paracrine signaling via cytokines, growth factors, and extracellular vehicles. The recent discovery of neuron-glioma interfaces and neurotransmitter-based interactions has uncovered novel mechanisms that favor tumor cell survival and growth.

GSCs occur in tumor niches where both stemness status and angiogenesis are conditioned by the microenvironment. In both perivascular and perinecrotic niches, hypoxia plays a fundamental role. Fifteen glioblastomas have been studied by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence for stemness and differentiation antigens. It has been found that circumscribed necroses develop inside hyperproliferating areas that are characterized by high expression of stemness antigens. Necrosis developed inside them because of the imbalance between the proliferation of tumor cells and endothelial cells; it reduces the number of GSCs to a thin ring around the former hyperproliferating area. The perinecrotic GSCs are nothing else that the survivors remnants of those populating hyperproliferating areas.

Glioblastoma is a highly invasive tumor, in which CCL5 expression correlates with shorter patient survival. Using immunohistochemistry, we identified CCL5 and CCR5 in a series of glioblastoma samples and cells, including glioblastoma stem cells. CCL5 and CCR5 gene expression were significantly higher in a cohort of 38 glioblastoma samples, compared to low-grade glioma and non-cancerous tissues. The in vitro invasion of patients-derived primary glioblastoma cells and glioblastoma stem cells was dependent on CCL5-induced CCR5 signaling and is strongly inhibited by the small molecule CCR5 antagonist maraviroc. Invasion of these cells, which was enhanced when co-cultured with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), was inhibited by maraviroc, suggesting that MSCs release CCR5 ligands. In support of this model, we detected CCL5 and CCR5 in MSC monocultures and glioblastoma-associated MSC in tissue sections.

Treatment with the use of surgery, radiation, or both is often associated with substantial morbidity related to vision loss, neuroendocrine dysfunction, and memory loss. Genotyping has shown that more than 90% of papillary craniopharyngiomas carry BRAF V600E mutations, but data are lacking with regard to the safety and efficacy of BRAF-MEK inhibition in patients with papillary craniopharyngiomas who have not undergone previous radiation therapy.\nMETHODS: Eligible patients who had papillary craniopharyngiomas that tested positive for BRAF mutations, had not undergone radiation therapy previously, and had measurable disease received the BRAF-MEK inhibitor combination vemurafenib-cobimetinib in 28-day cycles. The primary end point of this single-group, phase 2 study was objective response at 4 months as determined with the use of centrally determined volumetric data.\nRESULTS: Of the 16 patients in the study, 15 (94%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 70 to 100) had a durable objective partial response or better to therapy. The median reduction in the volume of the tumor was 91% (range, 68 to 99). The median follow-up was 22 months (95% CI, 19 to 30) and the median number of treatment cycles was 8. Progression-free survival was 87% (95% CI, 57 to 98) at 12 months and 58% (95% CI, 10 to 89) at 24 months. Three patients had disease progression during follow-up after therapy had been discontinued; none have died. The sole patient who did not have a response stopped treatment after 8 days owing to toxic effects. Grade 3 adverse events that were at least possibly related to treatment occurred in 12 patients, including rash in 6 patients. In 2 patients, grade 4 adverse events (hyperglycemia in 1 patient and increased creatine kinase levels in 1 patient) were reported; 3 patients discontinued treatment owing to adverse events.\nCONCLUSIONS: In this small, single-group study involving patients with papillary craniopharyngiomas, 15 of 16 patients had a partial response or better to the BRAF-MEK inhibitor combination vemurafenib-cobimetinib.

It is treated by surgical resection, but in most cases, total removal is not amenable due to its adhesion to the adjacent vital structures, such as the optic nerve, hypothalamus, and pituitary stalk. Often, tumor regrowth or recurrence occursand it is usually treated with either re-resection or radiotherapy, including stereotactic radiosurgery. Either treatment carries some important risks, including blindness, hypopituitarism, and cognitive impairment. A recent comprehensive genomic analysis revealed that the majority of papillary craniopharyngioma cases harbor a hotspot BRAF-V600E mutation. Several case reports have illustrated dramatic response of the residual or recurrent papillary craniopharyngioma to molecularly targeted therapy with a BRAF inhibitor(vemurafenib or dabrafenib)and a MEK inhibitor(trametinib), which are currently approved for melanoma and non-small cell lung carcinoma.

Bacteroides fragilis can lead to tumorigenesis by changing signaling pathways, including the WNT/\u03b2-catenin pathway. Therefore, in the present study, we investigated the correlation between the enterotoxigenic B. fragilis amount and the expression of signaling pathway genes involved in CRC.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: B. fragilis was determined in 30 tumors and adjacent healthy tissues by the qPCR method. Next, the relationship between enterotoxigenic B. fragilis and the expression of signaling pathway genes, including CCND1, TP53, BCL2, BAX, WNT, TCF, AXIN, APC, and CTNNB1 was investigated. Additionally, possible correlations between clinicopathological features of the tumor samples and the abundance of B. fragilis were analyzed.\nRESULTS: The results showed that B. fragilis was detected in 100% of tumor samples and 86% of healthy tissues. Additionally, enterotoxigenic B. fragilis colonized 47% of all samples, and bft-1 toxin was the most frequently found isotype among the samples. The analysis showed that the high level of B. fragilis has a significant relationship with the high expression of AXIN, CTNNB1, and BCL2 genes. On the other hand, our results did not show any possible correlation between this bacterium and the clinicopathological features of the tumor sample.\nCONCLUSION: B. fragilis had a higher abundance in the tumor samples than in healthy tissues, and this bacterium may lead to CRC by making changes in cellular signaling pathways and genes. Therefore, to better understand the physiological effects of B. fragilis on the inflammatory response and CRC, future research should focus on dissecting the molecular mechanisms by which this bacterium regulates cellular signaling pathways.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25105360": "The human body comprises fewer host cells than bacterial cells, most of which are obligate anaerobes residing in the gut. The symbiont Bacteroides fragilis constitutes a relatively small proportion (up to 1%-2%) of cultured fecal bacteria, but colonizes most humans. There are 2 classes of B. fragilis distinguished by their ability to secrete a zinc-dependent metalloprotease toxin, B. fragilis toxin (BFT). Strains that do not secrete BFT are nontoxigenic B. fragilis (NTBF), and those that do are called enterotoxigenic B. fragilis (ETBF). ETBF can induce clinical pathology, including inflammatory diarrhea, although asymptomatic colonization may be common. Intestinal inflammation is mediated by BFT, as yet the only known virulence factor of ETBF. Recent experimental evidence demonstrating that ETBF-driven colitis promotes colon tumorigenesis has generated interest in the potential contribution of ETBF to human colon carcinogenesis. Critical questions about the epidemiology of chronic, subclinical human colonization with ETBF and its impact on the biology of the colon need to be addressed.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30429227": "Many patients with chronic inflammation of the gut, such as that observed in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), develop colorectal cancer (CRC). Recent studies have reported that the development of IBD and CRC partly results from an imbalanced composition of intestinal microbiota and that intestinal inflammation in these diseases can be modulated by the microbiota. The human commensal Bacteroides fragilis is best exemplified playing a protective role against the development of experimental colitis in several animal disease models. In this study, we found that gut inflammation caused by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) treatment was inhibited by B. fragilis colonization in mice. Further, we reveal a protective role of B. fragilis treatment against colon tumorigenesis using an azoxymethane (AOM)/DSS-induced model of colitis-associated colon cancer in mice and demonstrate that the decreased tumorigenesis by B. fragilis administration is accompanied by inhibited expression of C-C chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) in the gut. We show direct evidence that the inhibition of tumor formation provided by B. fragilis in colitis-associated CRC animals was dependent on the production of polysaccharide A (PSA) from B. fragilis and that Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) signaling was responsible for the protective function of B. fragilisIMPORTANCE The incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) is rapidly growing worldwide, and there is therefore a greater emphasis on studies of the treatment or prevention of CRC pathogenesis. Recent studies suggested that consideration of the microbiota is unavoidable to understand inflammation and tumorigenesis in the gastrointestinal tract. We demonstrate, using a mouse model of colitis-associated CRC, that human commensal B. fragilis protects against colon tumorigenesis. The protective role against tumor formation provided by B. fragilis is associated with inhibition of expression of the chemokine receptor CCR5 in the colon. The molecular mechanism for protection against CRC provided by B. fragilis is dependent on polysaccharide A production and is mediated by TLR2 signaling.

The mucosal biopsies of involved sites were obtained from 68 patients with precancerous and cancerous lesions and 52 healthy controls (HC). The samples were cultured on Bacteroides Bile Esculin agar. Then, specific primers were designed to detect B. fragilis and bft gene using quantitative real-time PCR, and the possible links of ETBF with clinicopathological characteristics was evaluated. Also real-time PCR was performed to detect the bft gene subtypes. Bacteroides fragilis was detected in 51% of the patients and 48% of HCs cultures.

Also, B. fragilis was significantly more abundant in the patients' samples compared to those of HCs. In the patient group, higher odds ratio (OR) of ETBF was significantly associated with serrated lesions and adenoma with low-grade dysplasia. The bft1 gene was the most prevalent subtype of bft gene, followed by the bft2 gene.

CSF was obtained via lumbar puncture after general anesthesia and prior to incision. A frameless stereotaxy system was installed, and an infusion catheter was inserted to the GPi using intraoperative MRI. Infusion of autologous CSF was performed at a convective rate of 5 \u00b5L/min with a maximum volume of infusion (Vi) of 500 mL. T2-weighted MRI scans were obtained every 15 min up to a maximum of 105 min in order to calculate the volume of distribution (Vd). Safety was assessed with adverse event monitoring, and clinical outcomes were measured with changes in unmedicated UPDRS part III and PDQ-39 scores from baseline to 6 months postoperatively.\nRESULTS: All four infusions were safe and without adverse events. The mean unmedicated UPDRS part III and PDQ-39 scores improved by 24% and 26%, respectively. The Vd:Vi ratio ranged from 2.2 to 2.8 and peaked 45 min from the onset of infusion, which is when the borders of the GPi could generally be visualized based on T2-weighted MRI. Two patients underwent refinement of the stereotactic targeting based on infusion-enhanced images.\nCONCLUSIONS: The convective administration of autologous CSF to deep brain structures appears safe and feasible for enhancing intraoperative MRI during stereotactic procedures.

Abnormal iron levels have been extensively associated with tau pathology in neurodegenerative brains, however, its role in PSP pathogenesis remains yet unknown. We perform the first cell type-specific evaluation of PSP iron homeostasis and the closely related oxygen homeostasis, in relation to tau pathology in human postmortem PSP brains.\nMETHODS: In brain regions vulnerable to PSP pathology (GP, SN, and putamen), we visualized iron deposition in tau-affected and unaffected neurons, astroglia, oligodendrocytes, and microglia, using a combination of iron staining with immunolabelling. To further explore molecular pathways underlying our observations, we examined the expression of key iron and oxygen homeostasis mRNA transcripts and proteins.\nRESULTS: We found astrocytes as the major cell type accumulating iron in the early affected regions of PSP, highly associated with cellular tau pathology. The same regions are affected by dysregulated expression of alpha and beta hemoglobin and neuroglobin showing contrasting patterns. We discovered changes in iron and oxygen homeostasis-related gene expression associated with aging of the brain, and identified dysregulated expression of rare neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA) genes associated with tau pathology to distinguish PSP from the healthy aging brain.\nINTERPRETATION: We present novel aspects of PSP pathophysiology highlighting an overlap with NBIA pathways.

However, contemporary estimates of the overall incidence of autoimmune diseases and trends over time are scarce and inconsistent. We aimed to investigate the incidence and prevalence of 19 of the most common autoimmune diseases in the UK, assess trends over time, and by sex, age, socioeconomic status, season, and region, and we examine rates of co-occurrence among autoimmune diseases.\nMETHODS: In this UK population-based study, we used linked primary and secondary electronic health records from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD), a cohort that is representative of the UK population in terms of age and sex and ethnicity. Eligible participants were men and women (no age restriction) with acceptable records, approved for Hospital Episodes Statistics and Office of National Statistics linkage, and registered with their general practice for at least 12 months during the study period. We calculated age and sex standardised incidence and prevalence of 19 autoimmune disorders from 2000 to 2019 and used negative binomial regression models to investigate temporal trends and variation by age, sex, socioeconomic status, season of onset, and geographical region in England. To characterise co-occurrence of autoimmune diseases, we calculated incidence rate ratios (IRRs), comparing incidence rates of comorbid autoimmune disease among individuals with a first (index) autoimmune disease with incidence rates in the general population, using negative binomial regression models, adjusted for age and sex.\nFINDINGS: Among the 22\u2009009\u2009375 individuals included in the study, 978\u2009872 had a new diagnosis of at least one autoimmune disease between Jan 1, 2000, and June 30, 2019 (mean age 54\u00b70 years [SD 21\u00b74]). 625\u2009879 (63\u00b79%) of these diagnosed individuals were female and 352\u2009993 (36\u00b71%) were male.

Ex vivo experiments with D 2-HG identified immune inhibitory mechanisms.Results: IDH mutation associated with significantly reduced complement activation and decreased numbers of tumor-infiltrating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells with comparable FOXP3+/CD4+ ratios. D 2-HG potently inhibited activation of complement by the classical and alternative pathways, attenuated complement-mediated glioma cell damage, decreased cellular C3b(iC3b) opsonization, and impaired complement-mediated phagocytosis. Although D 2-HG did not affect dendritic cell differentiation or function, it significantly inhibited activated T-cell migration, proliferation, and cytokine secretion.Conclusions: D 2-HG suppresses the host immune system, potentially promoting immune escape of IDH-mutant tumors.

Drug manufacturing data and product labeling were also used. Studies of simvastatin, sitagliptin, or the combination were screened and analyzed to include relevant and recent papers. Selected English language trials were limited to those with human subjects and included both safety and efficacy outcomes.\nRESULTS: When compared with glipizide as add-on therapy to metformin, sitagliptin was noninferior but had lower rates of hypoglycemia and weight gain. In addition, when compared with insulin glargine, sitagliptin was less effective in decreasing glycosylated hemoglobin, but was associated with significantly lower rates of hypoglycemia. Further, trials have shown a beneficial effect of using statins in patients with diabetes mellitus with regard to decreasing cardiovascular risk, regardless of baseline lipid levels or the presence of a cardiac disease. Both medications have also demonstrated an acceptable side effect profile. However, caution is needed when coadministering with any drug that may increase simvastatin levels to reduce the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis.\nCONCLUSION: Juvisync should be used in patients requiring both sitagliptin and simvastatin. Both agents have shown good efficacy and acceptable safety profiles. Sitagliptin is a good option for diabetic patients to improve glycemic control with a lower risk of hypoglycemia and weight gain.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35158907": "Background: Epidemiological studies on the association between fish consumption and colorectal cancer (CRC) risk have yielded inconsistent results, despite evidence from preclinical studies that long-chain \u03c9-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids inhibit colorectal carcinogenesis. We conducted a meta-analysis of prospective epidemiological studies investigating the association between fish consumption and CRC risk among humans and reviewed studies examining the link between fish components and colorectal carcinogenesis in animal models. Methods: We included studies published until November 2020. We calculated the summary risk ratio (SRR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) through random effects meta-analysis models in order to summarize evidence from studies among humans. Results: Twenty-five prospective epidemiological studies encompassing 25,777 CRC cases were included. Individuals in the highest (vs. lowest) category of fish consumption had a significantly reduced risk of CRC (SRR 0.94, 95%CI 0.89-0.99). In dose-response meta-analysis, a 50-g increment in the daily consumption of fish was associated with a statistically significant 4% reduction in CRC risk (SRR 0.96, 95%CI 0.92-0.99). Preclinical studies (n = 25) identified multiple mechanisms of action of fish and fish components on colorectal carcinogenesis. Conclusions: Dietary recommendations for cancer prevention should take into account the evidence from epidemiological and preclinical studies that increasing fish consumption may be effective in preventing CRC.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7549825": "Although there is a strong positive association between total fat consumption and colorectal and breast cancer risk, there is evidence that n-3 fatty acids, mainly found in fish oil, are protective. If this is so, we would expect to be able to detect an inverse correlation between fish consumption and colorectal cancer and breast cancer mortality. Mortality data for breast and colorectal cancer in 24 European countries were correlated with current fish and fish oil consumption and with consumption 10 and 23 years previously. In males there was an inverse correlation between colorectal cancer mortality and current intake of fish (P = 0.036), a weaker correlation with fish consumption 10 years earlier (P = 0.042) and none with consumption 23 years earlier (P = 0.12). The data were not statistically significant in females. There was no correlation at all between breast cancer mortality and fish or fish oil consumption at any time. It is concluded that fish consumption is associated with protection against the later promotional stages of colorectal carcinogenesis, but not with the early initiation stages.

Tobacco, alcohol, and tea represent a risk against gastrointestinal cancer. Highly educated people are more conscious of the crucial role of prevention. In addition, nutrients were significantly associated with colorectal and gastric cancer. The findings suggest that lifestyle is associated with a risk of gastrointestinal cancer.

Human studies have not shown consistent results. We examined the association between intakes of fish and n-3 fatty acids from fish and colorectal cancer risk in men enrolled in the Physicians' Health Study.\nMETHODS: The Physicians' Health Study began as a randomized trial to examine the effect of aspirin and beta-carotene supplementation on cancer and cardiovascular disease. Fish intake was assessed at the 12-month follow-up with an abbreviated food-frequency questionnaire. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate multivariate relative risks for colorectal cancer for the categories of fish intake and quartiles of n-3 fatty acid intake.\nRESULTS: During 22 years of follow-up, 500 men had a confirmed diagnosis of colorectal cancer. Fish intake was inversely associated with colorectal cancer risk [multivariate relative risk (95% confidence interval) for highest versus lowest category, 0.63 (0.42-0.95); P trend = 0.02] [corrected] The inverse association was observed for both colon and rectal cancers. Our findings for n-3 fatty acids were similar to those for fish; the multivariate relative risk (95% confidence interval) of total colorectal cancer for the highest versus lowest quartile of n-3 fatty acids was 0.74 (0.57-0.95; P trend = 0.01).\nCONCLUSIONS: Our results from this long-term prospective study suggest that intakes of fish and long-chain n-3 fatty acids from fish may decrease the risk for colorectal cancer.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24706410": "The association between fish, \u03c9-3 and \u03c9-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) intake and risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) remains inconclusive.

We followed 123,529 US adults (76,386 women and 47,143 men) without a history of cancer at baseline for 24 to 26 years. Fish and PUFA intake was assessed at baseline and updated every 4 years by using a validated food-frequency questionnaire. We found no overall association between fish, \u03c9-3 and \u03c9-6 PUFA intake and CRC risk with hazard ratio (HR) of 1.03 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.89-1.20] comparing marine \u03c9-3 intake of \u2265 0.30 g/d versus <0.15 g/d among women and 1.05 (95% CI: 0.85-1.30) comparing intake of \u2265 0.41 g/d versus <0.16 g/d among men. However, fish and marine \u03c9-3 PUFA intake appeared to be positively associated with risk of distal colon cancer in both men and women and inversely with risk of rectal cancer in men. In an analysis based on a limited number of cases, marine \u03c9-3 PUFA intake assessed 12-16 years before diagnosis tended to be inversely associated with CRC risk in men (HR: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.52-1.10). In conclusion, although no overall association between fish, \u03c9-3 or \u03c9-6 PUFA intake was observed with CRC risk, marine \u03c9-3 PUFA may be differentially associated with risk of distal colon and rectal cancers and a long latency may be needed for its protection against CRC in men.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26012316": "Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), is an immunologically mediated chronic disease. The key underlying pathology is a deregulated immune response to commensal flora in a genetically susceptible host. Advances in genomics, epigenomics and understanding of the microbiome have brought forth the role of these spheres in the pathogenesis of IBD. Yet these factors explain only a small fraction of disease risk and our ability to predict relapses and response to treatment remains dismal. The external environment plays an important role in modifying the risk of IBD and in precipitating relapses in patients with established disease. The term 'exposome' was proposed to reflect a life-course of environmental influences beginning in-utero and proceeding right through childhood to adulthood. While the exposome is still a concept which needs practical perspective to enable better patient care, this review examines the gaps in our understanding that the IBD exposome helps explain. We further highlight the definition and parameters of this metric which can be incorporated for its application in research and clinical practice.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26339073": "The exposome, defined as the totality of an individual's exposures over the life course, is a seminal concept in the environmental health sciences. Although inherently geographic, the exposome as yet is unfamiliar to many geographers. This article proposes a place-based synthesis, genetic geographic information science (Genetic GISc) that is founded on the exposome, genome+ and behavome. It provides an improved understanding of human health in relation to biology (the genome+), environmental exposures (the exposome), and their social, societal and behavioral determinants (the behavome). Genetic GISc poses three key needs: First, a mathematical foundation for emergent theory; Second, process-based models that bridge biological and geographic scales; Third, biologically plausible estimates of space-time disease lags. Compartmental models are a possible solution; this article develops two models using pancreatic cancer as an exemplar. The first models carcinogenesis based on the cascade of mutations and cellular changes that lead to metastatic cancer. The second models cancer stages by diagnostic criteria. These provide empirical estimates of the distribution of latencies in cellular states and disease stages, and maps of the burden of yet to be diagnosed disease. This approach links our emerging knowledge of genomics to cancer progression at the cellular level, to individuals and their cancer stage at diagnosis, to geographic distributions of cancer in extant populations.

However, measurement of the environmental component in epidemiological studies has traditionally relied on much more uncertain and incomplete assessments than measurement of the genome. The 'exposome' has therefore been proposed as a new paradigm to encompass the totality of human environmental (meaning all non-genetic) exposures from conception onwards, complementing the genome. Evidently, there are large challenges in developing the exposome concept into a workable approach for epidemiological research. These include: (1) the accurate and reliable measurement of many exposures in the external environment, (2) the measurement of a wide range of biological responses in the internal environment, and (3) addressing the dynamic, life course nature of the exposome. New tools and technologies that can be applied to address these challenges include exposure biomarker technologies, geographical mapping and remote sensing technologies, smartphone applications and personal exposure sensors, and high-throughput molecular 'omics' techniques. Prospective, population-based cohort studies have recently started to implement these methods using the exposome framework. The exposome thus offers a new and exciting paradigm for improvement and integration of currently scattered and uncertain data on the environmental component in disease aetiology.

In this review, we have focused on the endogenous exposome, the DNA damage that arises from the production of endogenous electrophilic molecules in our cells. It provides quantitative data on endogenous DNA damage and its relationship to mutagenesis, with emphasis on when exogenous chemical exposures that produce identical DNA adducts to those arising from normal metabolism cause significant increases in total identical DNA adducts. We have utilized stable isotope labeled chemical exposures of animals and cells, so that accurate relationships between endogenous and exogenous exposures can be determined. Advances in mass spectrometry have vastly increased both the sensitivity and accuracy of such studies. Furthermore, we have clear evidence of which sources of exposure drive low dose biology that results in mutations and disease.

We can consider these collectively as environmental stressors. Exposomics is the comprehensive analysis of exposure to all environmental stressors and should yield a more thorough understanding of chronic disease development. We can operationalize exposomics by studying all the small molecules in the body and their influence on biological pathways that lead to impaired health. Here, we describe methods by which this may be achieved and discuss the application of exposomics to cumulative risk assessment in vulnerable populations. Since the goal of cumulative risk assessment is to analyze, characterize, and quantify the combined risks to health from exposures to multiple agents or stressors, it seems that exposomics is perfectly poised to advance this important area of environmental health science. We should therefore support development of tools for exposomic analysis and begin to engage impacted communities in participatory exposome research. A first step may be to apply exposomics to vulnerable populations already studied by more conventional cumulative risk approaches. We further propose that recent migrants, low socioeconomic groups with high environmental chemical exposures, and pregnant women should be high priority populations for study by exposomics. Moreover, exposomics allows us to study interactions between chronic stress and environmental chemicals that disrupt stress response pathways (i.e., 'stressogens').

Despite the sometimes debilitating nature of narcolepsy symptoms, the disease may go undiagnosed without an organized method for evaluating patients with sleep complaints. Many of the classic symptoms of narcolepsy, such as excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, sleep paralysis, and hypnagogic hallucinations, may be mistakenly associated with other disease states and must be differentiated from other sleep disorders. The results of self-administered sleep-disorder questionnaires are useful and may increase the suspicion of narcolepsy; however, referral to an accredited sleep laboratory for a formal sleep study including overnight polysomnography is necessary for a positive narcolepsy diagnosis. A variety of medications may be used to successfully treat excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy, the two most debilitating symptoms of the disease.

It is hard for doctors to correctly and objectively diagnose narcolepsy. Polysomnography (PSG) recordings, a gold standard for sleep monitoring and quality measurement, can provide abundant and objective cues for the narcolepsy diagnosis. There have been some studies on automatic narcolepsy diagnosis using PSG recordings. However, the sleep stage information, an important cue for narcolepsy diagnosis, has not been fully utilized. For example, some studies have not considered the sleep stage information to diagnose narcolepsy. Although some studies consider the sleep stage information, the stages are manually scored by experts, which is time-consuming and subjective. And the framework using sleep stages scored automatically for narcolepsy diagnosis is designed in a two-phase learning manner, where sleep staging in the first phase and diagnosis in the second phase, causing cumulative error and degrading the performance. To address these challenges, we propose a novel end-to-end framework for automatic narcolepsy diagnosis using PSG recordings. In particular, adopting the idea of multi-task learning, we take the sleep staging as our auxiliary task, and then combine the sleep stage related features with narcolepsy related features for our primary task of narcolepsy diagnosis. We collected a dataset of PSG recordings from 77 participants and evaluated our framework on it. Both of the sleep stage features and the end-to-end fashion contribute to diagnosis performance.

PDGFRA is frequently mutated/ amplified in pediatric HGG, but the significance of this finding has not been fully characterized. We hypothesize that alterations of PDGFRA will promote distinct prognostic and treatment implications in pediatric HGG. In order to characterize the impact of PDGFR pathway alterations, we integrated genomic data from pediatric HGG patients (n=290) from multiple pediatric datasets and sequencing platforms. Integration of multiple human datasets showed that PDGFRA mutation, but not amplification, was associated with older age in pediatric HGG (P= <0.0001). In multivariate analysis, PDGFRA mutation was correlated with worse prognosis (P = 0.026), while PDGFRA amplification was not (P = 0.11). By Kaplan-Meier analysis, non-brainstem HGG with PDGFRA amplification carried a worse prognosis than non-brainstem HGG without PDGFRA amplification (P = 0.021). There were no pediatric patients with PDGFRA-amplified HGG that survived longer than two years. Additionally, we performed paired molecular profiling (germline / tumor / primary cell culture) and targeting of an infant thalamic HGG with amplification and outlier increased expression of PDGFRA. Dasatinib inhibited proliferation most effectively. In summary, integration of the largest genomic dataset of pediatric HGG to date, allowed us to highlight that PDGFRA mutation is found in older pediatric patients and that PDGFRA amplification is prognostic in non-brainstem HGG.

Targeted sequencing of mutational hotspots in H3F3A, IDH1/2, and BRAF, and genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation and copy number abnormalities was performed in available tumors. Thirty-two patients [23 (72\u00a0%) with type 1 and 9 (28\u00a0%) with type 2 GC] were identified. Median age at diagnosis was 10.2\u00a0years (range 1.5-19.1). A median of 4 cerebral lobes (range 3-8) was affected at diagnosis. In addition, symmetrical bithalamic involvement was observed in 9 (28\u00a0%) patients. Twenty-two patients (69\u00a0%) had an anaplastic astrocytoma. Despite aggressive therapy, only two patients younger than 3\u00a0years at diagnosis are long-term survivors.

Genome-wide analyses of copy number imbalances previously showed that platelet-derived growth factor receptor \u03b1 (PDGFRA) is the most frequent target of focal amplification in pediatric HGGs, including DIPGs. To determine whether PDGFRA is also targeted by more subtle mutations missed by copy number analysis, we sequenced all PDGFRA coding exons from a cohort of pediatric HGGs. Somatic-activating mutations were identified in 14.4% (13 of 90) of nonbrainstem pediatric HGGs and 4.7% (2 of 43) of DIPGs, including missense mutations and in-frame deletions and insertions not previously described. Forty percent of tumors with mutation showed concurrent amplification, whereas 60% carried heterozygous mutations. Six different mutations impacting different domains all resulted in ligand-independent receptor activation that was blocked by small molecule inhibitors of PDGFR. Expression of mutants in p53-null primary mouse astrocytes conferred a proliferative advantage in vitro and generated HGGs in vivo with complete penetrance when implanted into brain. The gene expression signatures of these murine HGGs reflected the spectrum of human diffuse HGGs. PDGFRA intragenic deletion of exons 8 and 9 were previously shown in adult HGG, but were not detected in 83 nonbrainstem pediatric HGG and 57 DIPGs.

Gene expression was analyzed with gene expression microarrays for 53 tumors. Results were compared with publicly available data from adult tumors.\nRESULTS: Significant differences in copy number alterations distinguish childhood and adult glioblastoma. PDGFRA was the predominant target of focal amplification in childhood HGG, including diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas, and gene expression analyses supported an important role for deregulated PDGFRalpha signaling in pediatric HGG. No IDH1 hotspot mutations were found in pediatric tumors, highlighting molecular differences with adult secondary glioblastoma. Pediatric and adult glioblastomas were clearly distinguished by frequent gain of chromosome 1q (30% v 9%, respectively) and lower frequency of chromosome 7 gain (13% v 74%, respectively) and 10q loss (35% v 80%, respectively). PDGFRA amplification and 1q gain occurred at significantly higher frequency in irradiation-induced tumors, suggesting that these are initiating events in childhood gliomagenesis. A subset of pediatric HGGs showed minimal copy number changes.\nCONCLUSION: Integrated molecular profiling showed substantial differences in the molecular features underlying pediatric and adult HGG, indicating that findings in adult tumors cannot be simply extrapolated to younger patients.

We compared incidence trends stratified by age, as well as by race/ethnicity, sex, region, anatomic site, and stage at diagnosis.\nRESULTS: We observed 191,659 cases of early-onset and 1,097,765 cases of late-onset CRC during the study period. Overall, CRC incidence increased in every age group from 20 to 54 years. Whites were the only racial group with a consistent increase in incidence across all younger ages, with the steepest rise seen after 2012. Hispanics also experienced smaller increases in incidence in most of the younger age groups. Asians/Pacific Islanders and blacks saw no increase in incidence in any age group in 2016, but blacks continued to have the highest incidence of CRC for every age group.

Screening beginning at age 50 was most cost-effective in black men and least cost-effective in Latino women (measured as dollars spent per year of life saved) using annual fecal occult blood testing combined with flexible sigmoidoscopy every five years and using colonoscopy every 10 years. The cost-effectiveness of a 35-year screening program in black men beginning at age 45 was similar to the cost-effectiveness of screening white men and black women beginning at age 50 and more cost-effective than screening nonblack women as well as Asian and Latino men beginning at age 50.\nCONCLUSIONS: Screening is most cost-effective in black men because of high age-specific colorectal cancer incidence rates. Initiation of colorectal cancer screening in this high-risk group prior to age 50 should be strongly considered.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10826010": "Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States. In 1997, more than 131,000 new cases and more than 54,000 deaths were estimated. Racial and ethnic disparities in incidence, mortality and survival rates, and trends exist for this disease. Differences in colorectal cancer screening, early detection, and treatment in minority communities are related to therapeutic outcomes. Age-adjusted incidence rates for men with colorectal cancer are highest for Alaskan native men, followed by Japanese, then African-American men. For women, the incidence is highest for Alaskan native women, followed by African-American, then Japanese women. Mortality rates in men are highest for African Americans, followed by Alaskan natives and then Hawaiians. In women, mortality rates are highest for Alaskan natives, then African Americans and whites. Colorectal cancer screening rates vary by race, income, and education. It is interesting that, when compared with whites, African-American men demonstrate the higher reported rate of screening for this disease. In addition, site specificity is different for African Americans compared with whites. Findings also reveal that stage at diagnosis is an influential factor with regard to mortality and survival. This may be related in part to socioeconomic factors, differences in anatomic site, and treatment differences in African Americans. Risk factor data for this disease are scarce for minority populations. Documented differences in colorectal cancer incidence, mortality, and survival rates exist between minorities and whites. Additional research is needed on risk factors specific to African Americans and other minorities, differences in treatment, and the role of socioeconomic status.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9698125": "BACKGROUND: Although colorectal cancer rates are low among most groups of Native Americans in North America, rates for Alaska Natives have been substantially elevated compared with US rates for all races combined.\nMETHODS: To better describe the epidemiology of colorectal cancer incidence and survival among Alaska Natives, stratified by gender and tribal/ethnic affiliation, we examined data collected by the Alaska Native Cancer Registry 1969-1993. We calculated age-adjusted and age-specific incidence as well as actuarial survival rates, and examined histological type, site, stage at diagnosis, and treatment. We compared these data to colorectal cancer data from whites living in western Washington.\nRESULTS: In all, 587 colorectal cancer cases were identified among Alaska Natives over the 25-year period, for an age-adjusted annual incidence rate of 71.4/100000 in women, and 69.3/100000 in men. Compared to Alaska Indians, colon cancer rates were significantly higher in Aleuts (relative risk [RR] = 1.6, 95% CI: 1.2-2.2) and in Eskimos (RR = 1.5, 95% CI: 1.2-1.8), while rectal cancer rates did not differ by race/ethnicity. Alaska Natives experienced a 50% higher incidence rate of colorectal cancer overall compared to western Washington whites (RR = 1.5, 95% CI: 1.3-1.6), although rectal cancer rates were similar in the two populations. The highest RR were seen among Alaska Native women; Aleuts and Eskimos had colon cancer rates more than twice that of western Washington white women. No unusual qualitative features were found in the cancers occurring in Alaska Natives. Actuarial colorectal cancer survival rates for Alaska Natives overall were 74% at one year and 42% at 5 years; these rates were very similar to those observed for the western Washington population. Both one and 5-year survival rates showed a significant trend towards improvement over time.\nCONCLUSIONS: Alaska Natives had substantially higher colorectal cancer incidence rates compared to western Washington whites. Rates were particularly high for Aleut and Eskimo women.

It is required for the activation of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling pathway. LRP6 is detected in different tissue types and is involved in numerous biological activities such as cell proliferation, specification, metastatic cancer, and embryonic development. LRP6 is essential for the proper development of different organs in vertebrates, such as Xenopus laevis, chickens, and mice. In human, LRP6 overexpression and mutations have been reported in multiple complex diseases including hypertension, atherosclerosis, and cancers. Clinical studies have shown that LRP6 is involved in various kinds of cancer, such as bladder and breast cancer. Therefore, in this review, we focus on the structure of LRP6 and its interactions with Wnt inhibitors (DKK1, SOST). We also discuss the expression of LRP6 in different model systems, with emphasis on its function in development and human diseases.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16390319": "LRP5, along with LRP6 and their Drosophila homolog, Arrow, constitute a novel subclass of the LDL receptor superfamily. The arrangement of structural motifs in these receptors is different from the other members of the superfamily, and only recently have we begun to understand the functional importance of human LRP5 (and LRP6). Whole genome positional cloning studies have identified a number of mutations in LRP5 that underlie inherited human diseases/phenotypes, particularly those involving the skeleton and the eye. A number of studies have illustrated the importance of Lrp5/6/Arrow as a co-receptor with Frizzled for the Wnt proteins and their critical role in the regulation of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway. The cataloging of these human mutations, in combination with engineered mutations in mice and other studies involving gene/protein modifications, has led to a better understanding of the function of the various domains in LRP5/6. In this review, we discuss a number of studies that have revealed a wide variety of protein-protein interactions that occur with the various structural motifs in the Lrp5 protein. Ultimately, these interactions regulate the activity of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway and the role it plays in processes such as bone mass accrual and vision.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16263759": "Wnt co-receptors LRP5 and LRP6 are two members of the low-density lipoprotein receptor family. Receptor-associated protein is not only a specialized chaperone but also a universal antagonist for members of the low-density lipoprotein receptor family. Here we test whether Mesd, a newly identified chaperone for members of the low-density lipoprotein receptor family, also binds to mature receptors at the cell surface and antagonizes ligand binding. We found that Mesd binds to cell surface LRP5 and LRP6, but not to other members of the low-density lipoprotein receptor family. Scatchard analysis revealed that Mesd binds cell surface LRP6 with high affinity (K(d) approximately 3.3 nM). Interestingly, the C-terminal region of Mesd, which is absent in sequences from invertebrates, is necessary and sufficient for binding to mature LRP6, and is required for LRP6 folding. We also found that LRP6 is not a constitutively active endocytosis receptor and binding of the receptor-associated protein to LRP6 partially competes for Mesd binding. Finally, we demonstrated that Mesd antagonizes ligand binding to LRP6 at the cell surface. Together our results show that in addition to serving as a folding chaperone, Mesd can function as a receptor antagonist by inhibiting ligand binding to mature LRP6.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20543981": "BACKGROUND: The low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-6 (LRP6) is an essential co-receptor for canonical Wnt signaling. Dickkopf 1 (Dkk1), a major secreted Wnt signaling antagonist, binds to LRP6 with high affinity and prevents the Frizzled-Wnt-LRP6 complex formation in response to Wnts. Previous studies have demonstrated that Dkk1 promotes LRP6 internalization and degradation when it forms a ternary complex with the cell surface receptor Kremen.\nMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In the present study, we found that transfected Dkk1 induces LRP6 accumulation while inhibiting Wnt/LRP6 signaling. Treatment with Dkk1-conditioned medium or recombinant Dkk1 protein stabilized LRP6 with a prolonged half-life and induces LRP6 accumulation both at the cell surface and in endosomes. We also demonstrated that Kremen2 co-expression abrogated the effect of Dkk1 on LRP6 accumulation, indicating that the effect of Kremen2 is dominant over Dkk1 regulation of LRP6. Furthermore, we found that Wnt3A treatment induces LRP6 down-regulation, an effect paralleled with a Wnt/LRP6 signaling decay, and that Dkk1 treatment blocked Wnt3A-induced LRP6 down-regulation. Finally, we found that LRP6 turnover was blocked by an inhibitor of caveolae-mediated endocytosis.\nCONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results reveal a novel role for Dkk1 in preventing Wnt ligand-induced LRP6 down-regulation and contribute significantly to our understanding of Dkk1 function in Wnt/LRP6 signaling.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31679626": "Coronary artery disease (CAD), often related to dyslipidemia, is a major cause of death worldwide, highlighting unmet therapeutic needs. Lipoprotein receptor-related protein 6 (LRP6) is a member of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) family composed of structurally related cell surface receptors and acts, in consort with Frizzled receptors, as a coreceptor to mediate the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signalling pathway. Impaired LRP6 signalling in humans has been associated with multiple cardiovascular risk factors such as elevated serum LDL, triglycerides, and glucose levels. Considerable efforts have been deployed to better understand the underlying mechanisms of LRP6-associated disorders, and the therapeutic targeting of LRP6 has been demonstrated to have positive effects in various animal models of cardiovascular disease. This review presents a synthetic summary highlighting the major roles of LRP6. LRP6 regulates a multitude of cellular mechanisms dependently or independently of the \u03b2-catenin pathway, as LRP6 activates gene transcription, regulates crucial cellular events such as cell cycle or protein synthesis, and even modulates gap junctional coupling in cardiomyocytes and LDLR recycling in hepatocytes. We discuss the potential contribution of LRP6 as a therapeutic target, as LRP6 inhibition limits myocardial fibrosis and promotes cardiac repair in myocardial infarction, limits neointimal formation in carotid injury models, decreases blood pressure in hypertensive animals, and reduces adipogenesis and lipogenesis to prevent hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis.

However, there remains a lack of rigorous data regarding the effects of contraceptive options on vaginal bacteria and inflammation. Among 218 women enrolled into a substudy of the ECHO Trial (NCT02550067), we evaluate the effect of injectable intramuscular depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA-IM), levonorgestrel implant (LNG), and a copper intrauterine device (Cu-IUD) on the vaginal environment after one and six consecutive months of use, using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and multiplex cytokine assays. Primary endpoints include incident BV occurrence, bacterial diversity, and bacterial and cytokine concentrations. Secondary endpoints are bacterial and cytokine concentrations associated with later HIV seroconversion. Participants randomized to Cu-IUD exhibit elevated bacterial diversity, increased cytokine concentrations, and decreased relative abundance of lactobacilli after one and six months of use, relative to enrollment and other contraceptive options. Total bacterial loads of women using Cu-IUD increase 5.5 fold after six months, predominantly driven by increases in the concentrations of several inflammatory anaerobes.

For outcomes specific to IUD use (IUD expulsion and perforation), we examined effect measures for IUD users generally aged 25 years or younger compared with older IUD users. For outcomes of pregnancy, infection, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), and heavy bleeding or anemia, we examined young IUD users compared with young users of other contraceptive methods or no method.\nRESULTS: We identified 3169 articles of which 16 articles from 14 studies met our inclusion criteria. Six studies (Level II-2, good to poor) reported increased risk of expulsion among younger age groups compared with older age groups using copper-bearing (Cu-) IUDs. Two studies (Level II-2, fair) examined risks of expulsion among younger compared with older women using levonorgestrel-releasing (LNG-) IUDs; one reported no difference in expulsion, while the other reported increased odds for younger women. Four studies (Level II-2, good to poor) examined risk of expulsion among Cu- and LNG-IUD users combined and reported no significant differences between younger and older women. For perforation, four studies (Level II-2, fair to poor) found very low perforation rates (range, 0%-0.1%), with no significant differences between younger and older women. Pregnancies were generally rare among young IUD users in nine studies (Level I to II-2, fair to poor), and no differences were reported for young IUD users compared with young combined oral contraceptive (COC) or etonogestrel (ENG) implant users. PID was rare among young IUD users; one study reported no cases among COC or IUD users, and one reported no difference in PID among LNG-IUD users compared with ENG implant users from nationwide insurance claims data (Level I to II-2, fair). One study reported decreased odds of bleeding with LNG-IUD compared with COC use among young women, while one study of young women reported decreased odds of removal for bleeding with LNG-IUD compared with ENG implant (Level I to II-2, fair).\nCONCLUSION: Overall evidence suggests that the risk of adverse outcomes related to pregnancy, perforation, infection, heavy bleeding or removals for bleeding among young IUD users is low and may not be clinically meaningful. However, the risk of expulsion, especially for Cu-IUDs, is higher for younger women compared with older women. If IUD expulsion occurs, a young woman is exposed to an increased risk of unintended pregnancy if replacement contraception is not initiated.

Variation in clinical presentation, the rate of disease progression, and treatment responsiveness have been observed amongst DMD patients, suggesting that factors beyond the loss of dystrophin may contribute to DMD pathophysiology. Epigenetic mechanisms are becoming recognized as important factors implicated in the etiology and progression of various diseases. A growing number of genetic syndromes have been associated with unique genomic DNA methylation patterns (called \"episignatures\") that can be used for diagnostic testing and as disease biomarkers. To further investigate DMD pathophysiology, we assessed the genome-wide DNA methylation profiles of peripheral blood from 36 patients with DMD using the combination of Illumina Infinium Methylation EPIC bead chip array and EpiSign technology. We identified a unique episignature for DMD that whose specificity was confirmed in relation other neurodevelopmental disorders with known episignatures.

Our objectives were to compare the survival and safety of ECOG PS 3/4 patients who were administered chemotherapy with those who received BSC only.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed all consecutive mCRC patients who started first-line chemotherapy at our institution in a 4-year period. A multivariable Cox regression model was used to adjust for prognostic factors and logistic regression, to identify predictive factors of Grade 3/4 toxicity.\nRESULTS: From June 2008 to June 2012, 240 consecutive patients were included: 100 (41.7%) had an ECOG PS of 0/1, 75 (31.3%) ECOG PS of 2, and 65 (27%) ECOG PS of 3/4. Median survival for patients treated with chemotherapy was 18.4 months for patients with ECOG PS of 0/1, 10.8 months for those with ECOG PS of 2, and 6.8 months for patients with ECOG PS of 3/4. Among those with ECOG PS of 3/4, chemotherapy use led to a nonsignificant survival gain (median, 6.8 vs. 2.3 months for BSC; P = .13). Factors significantly associated with worse survival in an adjusted analysis were right-sided tumors (hazard ratio [HR], 2.97; P = .005) and ECOG PS status (ECOG PS 2 vs. 0/1; HR, 1.67; P = .025, and ECOG PS 3/4 vs. 0/1; HR, 2.67; P < .0001). The rate of Grade \u2265 3 toxicities during the first cycle did not differ significantly across ECOG groups; likely because 40% of ECOG PS 3/4 patients received upfront dose-reduced therapy. The rates of treatment-related hospitalization were similar across all ECOG groups.

The primary endpoint was change from baseline in percent predicted forced vital capacity (ppFVC). Secondary endpoints included other pulmonary function tests, upper limb function and strength assessments, and changes in upper arm fat and fibrosis scores on magnetic resonance imaging.\nRESULTS: Fifteen patients completed the trial. Annual change from baseline (SE) in ppFVC was -4.2 (0.7) (95% CI -5.5, -2.8). Rate of decline in ppFVC in pamrevlumab-treated patients was slower than observed in historical published trials of non-ambulatory patients. MISSION participants experienced slower-than-anticipated muscle function declines compared with natural history and historical published trials of non-ambulatory patients with DMD.

Colorectal cancer liver metastases (CRLM) thereby constitute a severe life-limiting factor. The therapy of CRLM presents a major challenge and surgical resection as well as systemic chemotherapy remain the first-line treatment options. Over the years several locoregional, vascular- and image-based treatments offered by interventional radiologists have emerged when conventional therapies fail, or metastases recurrence occurs. Among such options is the conventional/traditional transarterial chemoembolization (cTACE) by local injection of a combination of chemotherapeutic- and embolic-agents. A similar treatment is the more recent irinotecan-loaded drug-eluting beads TACE (DEBIRI-TACE), which are administered using the same approach. Numerous studies have shown that these different types of chemoembolization can be applied in different clinical settings safely. Furthermore, such treatments can also be combined with other local or systemic therapies. Unfortunately, due to the incoherent patient populations of studies investigating TACE in CRLM, critics state that the definite evidence supporting positive patient outcomes is still lacking. In the following article we review studies on conventional and DEBIRI-TACE. Although highly dependent on the clinical setting, prior therapies and generally the study population, cTACE and DEBIRI-TACE show comparable results. We present the most representative studies on the different chemoembolization procedures and compare the results. Although there is compelling evidence for both approaches, further studies are necessary to determine which patients profit most from these therapies.

Treating CRLMs with thermal ablation can prolong survival, but compared to lesions smaller than 3 cm, local control rates and overall survival are relatively worse with larger, intermediate (3-5 cm) lesions. Local recurrence rates range between 1.7%-20.2% and 6.7%-68.9% for CRLMs less than 3 cm and greater than 3 cm, respectively. Worse outcomes are also present when ablating intermediate size hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and there are some pathological similarities with CRLMs, namely the presence of micrometastatic disease. Combining ablation with transarterial chemoembolization is more effective in treating intermediate-size HCC than ablation alone. A meta-analysis of robust randomized controlled trials demonstrated long-term improved survival with combination therapy compared to ablation alone (odds ratio at 1, 3 and 5 years of 2.74, 2.77 and 5.23, respectively). There is, however, minimal evidence for combination therapy in CRLMs, limited to a handful of studies that are predominantly retrospective and have heterogeneous inclusion criteria.

Median OS and PFS were 15 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 13.1 months, 16.9 months) and 6 months (95% CI 4.7 months, 7.3 months), respectively. Multivariate analysis found that synchronous metastatic disease, presence of extrahepatic metastasis, and Child-Pugh score B were independent prognostic factor for OS and PFS. Two patients (3.8%) had severe complications. The results of subgroup analysis showed that synchronous liver metastasis and extrahepatic metastasis had an effect on the prognosis of patients, while the primary tumor sites (rectum, left, and right colon) had no effect on the prognosis.\nCONCLUSIONS: TACE is well tolerated and effective in patients with unresectable chemotherapy refractory CRCLM.

The 1-year survival rate after chemoembolization was 62%, the 2-year survival rate was 28% and the 3-year survival rate was 7%. Median survival from the start of chemoembolization treatment was 14.3 months. The indication (p = 0.001) and initial tumor response (p = 0.015) were statistically significant factors for patient's survival.

It is based on drug-eluting microspheres pre-loaded with chemotherapeutics, which are injected selectively into vessels supplying the tumour, to embolize them inducing ischaemia, and elute the drug, to induce tumour response. We present our initial experience with novel irinotecan- loaded Embocure Plus microspheres in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer tumours in the liver, and their effect on HCT-116 cell cultures in vitro.\nMATERIAL AND METHODS: Three consecutive male patients (median age 62 [50-76] years) with liver metastatic colorectal cancer tumours were selected. All patients had a pre-procedure contrast-enhanced computed tomography, confirming multiple metastatic liver tumours (mean tumour diameter = 42 mm; range: 14-77 mm) and periprocedural dyna-CT scans for rapid treatment results assessment. In vitro: Human colon HCT116 cancer cell line was cultured, irinotecan loaded Embocure Plus microspheres were added. Cultures were assessed after 24 hours and 72 hours of incubation in normoxia or hypoxia.\nRESULTS: All embolizations were technically successful, and no complications were observed. Stabilization of the targeted metastatic liver tumours in all patients was noted. In vitro: Significant decrease of the growth of HTC 116 cell lines were observed in controls compared to cells treated with Embocure Plus loaded with irinotecan in normoxia and hypoxia after 48 and 72 hours. We observed a tendency for less inhibited cell proliferation in low-oxygen conditions.\nCONCLUSIONS: TACE therapy of liver metastatic tumours shows satisfactory results and a low complication rate. Embocure Plus microspheres are safe and technically feasible for superselective chemoembolization of metastatic colorectal cancer liver tumour.

Markov modeling was used to model disease progression and patient survival after treatment in 3-month cycles. Data on probabilities and utilities were extracted from the literature. Costs were evaluated from the Medicare payer's perspective in 2020 US dollars. Sensitivity analyses were performed for key variables. Data were collected from October 3, 2020, to January 20, 2021, and analyzed from November 15, 2020, to April 25, 2021.\nEXPOSURES: Two treatment strategies, SCRT-TNT vs LCCRT with adjuvant chemotherapy, were compared.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Cost-effectiveness was evaluated using the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio and net monetary benefits. Effectiveness was defined as quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Both costs and QALYs were discounted at 3% annually. Willingness-to-pay threshold was set at $50\u202f000/QALY.\nRESULTS: During the 5-year horizon, the total cost was $41\u202f355 and QALYs were 2.21 for SCRT-TNT; for LCCRT, the total cost was $54\u202f827 and QALYs were 2.12, resulting in a negative incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (-$141\u202f256.77).

Multimodality therapy improves long-term survival. Current standards advise neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by radical surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy. Nationally, compliance with adjuvant chemotherapy is only 32%. New research evaluates the effectiveness of total neoadjuvant therapy: complete chemotherapy and chemoradiation before surgery.\nOBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to determine the favored treatment for locally advanced rectal cancer by comparing the cost-effectiveness of total neoadjuvant therapy and the current standard of care.\nDESIGN: Decision analytical modeling using long-term costs and 5-year disease-free survival was performed to determine the cost-effectiveness after total neoadjuvant therapy and the current standard of care. Sensitivity analysis was used to investigate the effect of uncertainty in model parameters.\nSETTINGS: Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services billing data perspective was adopted and outcomes modeled according to local and national databases and literature consensus.\nPATIENTS: Adult patients with stage II or III rectal cancer were selected.\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cost-effectiveness in disease-free life-years, incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, and net monetary benefit were determined over a 5-year posttreatment period. The favored strategy was determined based on cost-effectiveness and sensitivity analyses.\nRESULTS: Cost-effectiveness for total neoadjuvant therapy was 40,708 $/life-year, and, for conventional therapy, cost-effectiveness was 44,248 $/life-year. Sensitivity analysis showed that, for an estimated total neoadjuvant therapy completion rate of 90%, total neoadjuvant therapy would remain the dominant strategy for any adjuvant chemotherapy completion rate of less than 93%.\nLIMITATIONS: The samples used to calculate completion rates are small, and survival probabilities are based on existing literature, local database values, and consensus estimates. The model encompasses a 5-year time period from diagnosis.\nCONCLUSIONS: Cost-effectiveness analysis shows that a strategy of total neoadjuvant therapy followed by radical surgery is favored over the current standard of care for locally advanced rectal cancer. Sensitivity analysis shows that a low rate of adjuvant chemotherapy administration plays a key role in decreasing the cost-effectiveness of the current standard of care.

Utilities and probabilities from the literature and costs from the Healthcare Bluebook and Medicare fee schedules were used to determine incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. It was assumed that long-course chemoradiotherapy would result in higher rates of low anterior resection (LAR). To model preference-sensitive care, a 2-way sensitivity analysis was conducted in which the utilities of the no-evidence-of-disease (NED) states with LAR and abdominoperineal resection (APR) were simultaneously varied. The analysis was repeated for patients with distal rectal tumors. Analysis was conducted from January to October 2018.\nEXPOSURES: Short-course radiotherapy and long-course chemoradiotherapy.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios.\nRESULTS: Short-course radiotherapy was the cost-effective strategy compared with long-course chemoradiotherapy (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, $133\u202f495 per quality-adjusted life-year). Two-way sensitivity analysis revealed that the cost-effective approach for a given patient depended on the utilities for the NED-LAR and NED-APR states.

The objective of this study was to perform a cost analysis comparing SCRT-TNT versus LCRT.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: In 2020-2021, a prospective registry was created to document RC patients who received neoadjuvant therapy and the costs of cancer treatments, transportation and the time patients and family members spent in the hospital. This registry outlined the direct and indirect costs of LCRT versus SCRT-TNT.\nRESULTS: LCRT and SCRT-TNT regimens have direct costs that range from S/.5,993.30 to S/.27,928.36 and from S/.3,409.81 to S/.18,159.42, respectively. FOLFOX regimens are the most expensive.

The indirect cost of FOLFOX regimens is twice that of the similar modality that combines irradiation and Oxaliplatin IV and Capecitabine VO (CAPOX). SCRT-TNT regimens with CAPOX reduce costs by at least 50%, while SCRT-TNT regimens with FOLFOX reduce costs by 32%.\nCONCLUSION: Despite using IMRT/VMAT, SCRT-TNT is a less expensive approach for patients with RC when compared to LCRT.

A noteworthy concern is that the RAPIDO trial did not ensure that all patients in the control arm received adjuvant chemotherapy. This may bias statistical estimates in favour of the experimental arm if adjuvant chemotherapy is active in rectal cancer. Moreover, the 5-year update revealed an increase in the risk of local relapse in the experimental arm.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: We carried out sensitivity analyses to determine how plausible effects of adjuvant chemotherapy, adjusted by the proportion of patients in the standard arm receiving adjuvant treatment, would have influenced the observed treatment effect estimate of the RAPIDO trial. The most plausible values for the benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy were determined by Bayesian re-analysis of a prior meta-analysis.\nRESULTS: The meta-analysis suggested that oxaliplatin/fluorouracil-based adjuvant chemotherapy may improve disease-free survival (DFS) in rectal cancer although the signal is weak [hazard ratio (HR) 0.84, 95% credible interval, 0.57-1.15]; probability of benefit (HR <1) was 91.2%. In the sensitivity analysis, the HR for disease-related treatment failure would remain <1, thus favouring total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT), on most occasions, but the null hypothesis would not have been rejected in various credible settings. For the RAPIDO data to be consistent with the null effect, a moderate benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy (HR for DFS between 0.75 and 0.80) and 70%-80% of exposed participants would suffice.\nCONCLUSION: The decision to make adjuvant chemotherapy optional in the standard arm may have biased the results in favour of the experimental arm, in a scenario in which TNT does not offset the increase in local recurrences after SC-RT.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28185757": "OBJECTIVES: To develop evidence-based guideline recommendations through a systematic review of the literature to establish standard molecular biomarker testing of colorectal cancer (CRC) tissues to guide epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) therapies and conventional chemotherapy regimens.\nMETHODS: The American Society for Clinical Pathology, College of American Pathologists, Association for Molecular Pathology, and American Society of Clinical Oncology convened an expert panel to develop an evidence-based guideline to establish standard molecular biomarker testing and guide therapies for patients with CRC.

Although advanced CRC patients who harbor the BRAF V600E mutation have a poorer prognosis, they are eligible for combinatorial therapy targeting EGFR/BRAF or BRAF/MEK within the MAP kinase signaling pathway. Once primarily thought to be a negative prognostic marker, BRAF V600E mutation is now considered as a positive predictive factor with an opportunity for clinical intervention.

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the clinical, pathological and molecular phenotype of colorectal tumors with BRAF mutations.\nRESULTS: Mutations in BRAF were identified in 8% (23/275) of colorectal cancers. They were 5-10-fold more frequent in tumors with infiltrating lymphocytes, location in the proximal colon, poor histological grade and mucinous appearance (P < 0.002 for each). Tumors with BRAF mutation were also 10-fold more likely to show microsatellite instability and frequent DNA methylation (P < 0.0001) compared to tumors without this mutation. The characteristic morphological features of tumors with BRAF mutation (infiltrating lymphocytes, poor grade, mucinous) remained after stratification according to microsatellite instability and methylator phenotypes.

Although the overall frequency of KRAS mutations (36.6%) seemed to be similar to those reported for other populations, the rate of point mutations at codon 13 was significantly lower (12%) in Greek patients with colorectal cancer and associated with male gender (P < 0.05). Tumors with G>T codon 12 transversions and G>C transitions showed more frequent lymph node metastasis (P < 0.05, P < 0.005, respectively). The rate of KRAS mutations gradually decreased with increasing histological grade (P < 0.05), as opposed to BRAF mutations, which were strongly associated with poorly differentiated tumors (P < 0.005). Additionally, we found that the histological features of preexisting adenoma were associated with the absence of BRAF mutations, in contrast to KRAS (P < 0.05). Our data suggested that there seems to be a correlation between morphological criteria and discrete genetic pathways in colorectal carcinogenesis. Moreover, ethnic or geographic factors may have an impact on genetic background of colorectal carcinomas, and specific types of KRAS mutations may influence the metastatic potential of colorectal tumors.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31162857": "Mutations of KRAS, NRAS, BRAF and DNA mismatch repair (MMR) status have become an important part of the assessment of patients with colorectal cancer (CRC), while respective clinicopathologic features and prognostic significance in specific stages and related detection strategies remain unclear. We retrospectively analyzed clinicopathologic features and prognosis of 1,834 patients with Stage I-IV colorectal adenocarcinoma. Mutations in KRAS, NRAS and BRAF and DNA MMR status were determined. The mutation rates of KRAS, NRAS and BRAF were 46.4, 3.2 and 3.5%, respectively, and the mismatch repair gene deletion (dMMR) rate was 5.6%. In a multivariate analysis, female, advanced age, tumor type histology, mucinous carcinoma and positive tumor deposits were associated with a high KRAS mutation rate. A high BRAF mutation rate was associated with female, poor differentiation, lymphovascular invasion and positive tumor deposits. Factors associated with high dMMR rates included low age, large tumor size, poor differentiation, Stages I-III. Tumor site was independently associated with KRAS mutation, BRAF mutation and dMMR. KRAS and BRAF mutations were independent risk factors for shorter overall survival (OS) in Stage IV tumors but not in Stage I-III tumors. NRAS mutation was an independent risk factor for shorter OS in Stage I-II tumors. dMMR was independently associated with longer OS in Stage III tumors.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37517630": "Pregnant women traveling abroad can be exposed to a variety of arboviruses, primarily spread by mosquitoes or ticks.

Similarly to sorafenib, this agent was originally developed as a RAF1 inhibitor. However, the kinase inhibitory profile is distinct from sorafenib. A broad-spectrum of kinase inhibition induces wide-range drug sensitivity, irrespective of mutation status of major oncogenes. This agent's main therapeutic effects are anti-angiogenesis and the remodeling of tumor microenvironment through several mechanisms of action. The dual blockade of VEGF receptors and TIE2 can lead to both additive anti-angiogenesis effects and the suggestive unique regulation of vessel stability. Additionally, it inhibits molecular escape pathways to VEGF inhibition (e.g., FGF, PIGF, and PDGF signaling), enabling its continuous antiangiogenic effect even in tumors resistant to VEGF inhibitors. Furthermore, regorafenib has the important effect of enhancing anti-tumor immunity via macrophage modulation. Based on this concept, clinical trials have been recently launched for the development of a combination strategy with immune checkpoint inhibitors. Contrary to regorafenib induced clinical benefits and advances in the novel strategy, currently no predictive biomarkers have been identified. In the present review, we revisit and summarize regorafenib's unique mechanisms of action.

Different studies have displayed its antitumor activity in several cancer models (both in vitro and in vivo), particularly in colorectal and gastrointestinal stromal cancers. The mechanism of resistance to regorafenib is largely unknown. In our investigation, we have generated regorafenib-resistant SW480 cells (Reg-R-SW480 cells) by culturing such cells with increasing concentration of regorafenib. Examination of intracellular signaling found that Akt signaling was activated in Reg-R-SW480 cells but not in wild-type SW480 cells, after regorafenib treatment as measured by Western Blot. The Notch pathway is a fundamental signaling system in the development and homeostasis of tissues since it regulates different cellular process such as proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis and it can be a potential driver of resistance to a wide array of targeted therapies. In this study, we found that Notch-1 was significantly up-regulated in resistant tumor cells as well as HES1 and HEY. Additionally, inhibition of Notch-1 in resistant cells partially restored sensitivity to regorafenib treatment in vitro.

Our study aimed to gain further insight into the molecular mechanisms of regorafenib and to assess its potential in combination therapy. Regorafenib was tested alone and in combination with irinotecan in patient-derived (PD) CRC models and a murine CRC liver metastasis model. Mechanism of action was investigated using in vitro functional assays, immunohistochemistry and correlation with CRC-related oncogenes. Regorafenib demonstrated significant inhibition of growth-factor-mediated vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) 2 and VEGFR3 autophosphorylation, and intracellular VEGFR3 signaling in human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HuVECs) and lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs), and also blocked migration of LECs. Furthermore, regorafenib inhibited proliferation in 19 of 25 human CRC cell lines and markedly slowed tumor growth in five of seven PD xenograft models. Combination of regorafenib with irinotecan significantly delayed tumor growth after extended treatment in four xenograft models. Reduced CD31 staining indicates that the antiangiogenic effects of regorafenib contribute to its antitumor activity. Finally, regorafenib significantly delayed disease progression in a murine CRC liver metastasis model by inhibiting the growth of established liver metastases and preventing the formation of new metastases in other organs. In addition, our results suggest that regorafenib displays antimetastatic activity, which may contribute to its efficacy in patients with metastatic CRC.

However, the mechanisms of action of regorafenib in colorectal cancer cells have been unclear. We investigated how regorafenib suppresses colorectal cancer cell growth and potentiates effects of other chemotherapeutic drugs.\nEXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We determined whether and how regorafenib induces the expression of PUMA, a p53 target and a critical mediator of apoptosis in colorectal cancer cells. We also investigated whether PUMA is necessary for the killing and chemosensitization effects of regorafenib in colorectal cancer cells. Furthermore, xenograft tumors were used to test if PUMA mediates the in vivo antitumor, antiangiogenic, and chemosensitization effects of regorafenib.\nRESULTS: We found that regorafenib treatment induces PUMA in colorectal cancer cells irrespective of p53 status through the NF-\u03baB pathway following ERK inhibition and glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2 activation. Upregulation of PUMA is correlated with apoptosis induction in different colorectal cancer cell lines. PUMA is necessary for regorafenib-induced apoptosis in colorectal cancer cells. Chemosensitization by regorafenib is mediated by enhanced PUMA induction through different pathways. Furthermore, deficiency in PUMA abrogates the in vivo antitumor, antiangiogenic, and chemosensitization effects of regorafenib.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate a key role of PUMA in mediating the anticancer effects of regorafenib in colorectal cancer cells. They suggest that PUMA induction can be used as an indicator of regorafenib sensitivity, and also provide a rationale for manipulating the apoptotic machinery to improve the therapeutic efficacy of regorafenib and other targeted drugs.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28489887": "AIM: Regorafenib is an oral small-molecule multi kinase inhibitor. Recently, several clinical trials have revealed that regorafenib has an anti-tumor activity in gastric cancer. However, only part of patients benefit from regorafenib, and the mechanisms of regorafenib's anti-tumor effect need further demonstrating. In this study, we would assess the potential anti-tumor effects and the underlying mechanisms of regorafenib in gastric cancer cells, and explore novel biomarkers for patients selecting of regorafenib.\nMETHODS: The anti-tumor effects of regorafenib on gastric cancer cells were analyzed via cell proliferation and invasion. The underlying mechanisms were demonstrated using molecular biology techniques.\nRESULTS: We found that regorafenib inhibited cell proliferation and invasion at the concentration of 20\u03bcmol/L and in a dose dependent manner. The anti-tumor effects of regorafenib related to the decreased expression of CXCR4, and elevated expression and activation of CXCR4 could reverse the inhibition effect of regorafenib on gastric cancer cells. Further studies revealed that regorafenib reduced the transcriptional activity of Wnt/\u03b2-Catenin pathway and led to decreased expression of Wnt pathway target genes, while overexpression and activation of CXCR4 could attenuate the inhibition effect of regorafenib on Wnt/\u03b2-Catenin pathway.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrated that regorafenib effectively inhibited cell proliferation and invasion of gastric cancer cells via decreasing the expression of CXCR4 and further reducing the transcriptional activity of Wnt/\u03b2-Catenin pathway.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24584572": "Renal cysts are clinically and genetically heterogeneous conditions. Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is common and its characterization has paved the way for the identification of a growing number of cilia-related disorders (ciliopathies) of which most show cystic kidneys. While the recessive form of PKD (ARPKD) virtually always presents in childhood, early onset can, in some instances, also occur in the dominant form (ADPKD). Both ADPKD genes (PKD1 and PKD2) can also be inherited in a recessive way, making the story more complex with evidence for a dosage-sensitive network. Several phenocopies are known, and mutations in HNF1\u00df or genes that typically cause other ciliopathies, such as nephronophthisis, Bardet-Biedl, Joubert syndrome and related disorders, can mimic PKD. An accurate genetic diagnosis is crucial for genetic counseling, prenatal diagnostics, and the clinical management of patients and their families. The increasing number of genes that have to be considered in patients with cystic kidney disease is challenging to address by conventional techniques and largely benefits from next-generation sequencing-based approaches.

ADPKD and ARPKD represent the leading genetic causes of renal disease in adults and children, respectively. ADPKD is caused by mutations in PKD1 encoding polycystin1 (PC1) and PKD2 encoding polycystin 2 (PC2). PC1/2 are multi-pass transmembrane proteins that form a complex localized in the primary cilium. Predominant ARPKD cases are caused by mutations in polycystic kidney and hepatic disease 1 (PKHD1) gene that encodes the Fibrocystin/Polyductin (FPC) protein, whereas a small subset of cases are caused by mutations in DAZ interacting zinc finger protein 1 like (DZIP1L) gene. FPC is a type I transmembrane protein, localizing to the cilium and basal body, in addition to other compartments, and DZIP1L encodes a transition zone/basal body protein. Apparently, PC1/2 and FPC are signaling molecules, while the mechanism that cilia employ to govern renal tubule morphology and prevent cyst formation is unclear. Nonetheless, recent genetic and biochemical studies offer a glimpse of putative physiological malfunctions and the pathomechanisms underlying both disease entities. In this review, I summarize the results of genetic studies that deduced the function of PC1/2 on cilia and of cilia themselves in cyst formation in ADPKD, and I discuss studies regarding regulation of polycystin biogenesis and cilia trafficking. I also summarize the synergistic genetic interactions between Pkd1 and Pkhd1, and the unique tissue patterning event controlled by FPC, but not PC1. Interestingly, while DZIP1L mutations generate compromised PC1/2 cilia expression, FPC deficiency does not affect PC1/2 biogenesis and ciliary localization, indicating that divergent mechanisms could lead to cyst formation in ARPKD.

There is clinical and genetic overlap between both entities with very variable clinical courses. Subgroups of very early onset ADPKD may for example clinically resemble ARPKD. The basis of the clinical variability in both forms of PKD is not well understood and there are also limited prediction markers for disease progression for daily clinical life or surrogate endpoints for clinical trials in ARPKD or early ADPKD.As targeted therapeutic approaches to slow disease progression in PKD are emerging, it is becoming more important to reliably identify patients at risk for rapid progression as they might benefit from early therapy.

The clinical observations are complemented by genetic studies and biorepositories as well as basic science approaches to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms in the PKD field.

Mortality estimates were produced using the cause of death ensemble model. We also calculated DALYs attributable to risk factors that had evidence of causation with colorectal cancer.\nFINDINGS: Globally, between 1990 and 2019, colorectal cancer incident cases more than doubled, from 842\u2009098 (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 810\u2009408-868\u2009574) to 2\u00b717 million (2\u00b700-2\u00b734), and deaths increased from 518\u2009126 (493\u2009682-537\u2009877) to 1\u00b709 million (1\u00b702-1\u00b715).

Yet, marked decreases in incidence are now observed in countries that have attained very high human development. Thus, in this study, we explored the relationship between human development and colorectal cancer incidence, and in particular assessed whether national transitions to very high human development are linked to temporal patterns in colorectal cancer incidence. For these analyses, we utilized the Human Development Index (HDI) and annual incidence data from regional and national cancer registries. Truncated (30-74 years) age-standardized incidence rates were calculated. Yearly incidence rate ratios and HDI ratios, before and after transitioning to very high human development, were also estimated. Among the 29 countries investigated, colorectal cancer incidence was observed to decrease after reaching the very high human development threshold for 12 countries; decreases were also observed in a further five countries, but the age-standardized incidence rates remained higher than that observed at the threshold. Such declines or stabilizations are likely due to colorectal cancer screening in some populations, as well as varying levels of exposure to protective factors. In summary, it appears that there is a threshold at which human development predicts a stabilization or decline in colorectal cancer incidence, though this pattern was not observed for all countries assessed. Future cancer planning must consider the increasing colorectal cancer burden expected in countries transitioning towards higher levels of human development, as well as possible declines in incidence among countries reaching the highest development level.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33618551": "Global trends in the incidence and mortality rates of colorectal cancer show a steady increase with significant predilection to western developed countries, possibly linking it to westernized lifestyles among other risk factors. This study aims to investigate the incidence and trends of colorectal cancer in Lebanon, a country in the Middle East and North Africa region, and to compare these rates to those in regional and western countries. Colorectal cancer incidence data were extracted from the Lebanese National Cancer Registry for the currently available years 2005 to 2016. The calculated age-standardized incidence rates and age-specific rates were expressed as per 100,000 population. The age-standardized incidence rates of colorectal cancer in Lebanon increased from 16.3 and 13.0 per 100,000 in 2005 to 23.2 and 20.2 per 100,000 in 2016, among males and females, respectively. The incidences were higher for males, and they increased with age. The annual percent change was +4.36% and +4.45%, in males and females respectively (p-value < 0.05). There was a non-statistically significant trend of decrease in recent years (since 2012 in males and since 2011 in females). The age-standardized incidence rates in Lebanon were higher than those in the majority of the regional countries, but lower than the rates in developed western countries. There were high age-specific incidence rates at age groups 40-44 and 45-49 years in Lebanon in both males and females (with significant rising temporal trend) compared to other countries, including the ones reported to have the highest colorectal cancer age-standardized incidence rate worldwide. Therefore, the burden of colorectal cancer is significant in Lebanon. This raises the necessity to develop national strategies tailored to reduce colorectal cancer incidence through promoting healthy lifestyles, raising awareness, and early detection as of 40 years of age.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31648977": "BACKGROUND: Data about the global, regional, and country-specific variations in the levels and trends of colorectal cancer are required to understand the impact of this disease and the trends in its burden to help policy makers allocate resources. Here we provide a status report on the incidence, mortality, and disability caused by colorectal cancer in 195 countries and territories between 1990 and 2017.\nMETHODS: Vital registration, sample vital registration, verbal autopsy, and cancer registry data were used to generate incidence, death, and disability-adjusted life-year (DALY) estimates of colorectal cancer at the global, regional, and national levels. We also determined the association between development levels and colorectal cancer age-standardised DALY rates, and calculated DALYs attributable to risk factors that had evidence of causation with colorectal cancer. All of the estimates are reported as counts and age-standardised rates per 100\u2008000 person-years, with some estimates also presented by sex and 5-year age groups.\nFINDINGS: In 2017, there were 1\u00b78 million (95% UI 1\u00b78-1\u00b79) incident cases of colorectal cancer globally, with an age-standardised incidence rate of 23\u00b72 (22\u00b77-23\u00b77) per 100\u2008000 person-years that increased by 9\u00b75% (4\u00b75-13\u00b75) between 1990 and 2017. Globally, colorectal cancer accounted for 896\u2008000 (876\u2008300-915\u2008700) deaths in 2017, with an age-standardised death rate of 11\u00b75 (11\u00b73-11\u00b78) per 100\u2008000 person-years, which decreased between 1990 and 2017 (-13\u00b75% [-18\u00b74 to -10\u00b70]). Colorectal cancer was also responsible for 19\u00b70 million (18\u00b75-19\u00b75) DALYs globally in 2017, with an age-standardised rate of 235\u00b77 (229\u00b77-242\u00b70) DALYs per 100\u2008000 person-years, which decreased between 1990 and 2017 (-14\u00b75% [-20\u00b74 to -10\u00b73]). Slovakia, the Netherlands, and New Zealand had the highest age-standardised incidence rates in 2017. Greenland, Hungary, and Slovakia had the highest age-standardised death rates in 2017. Numbers of incident cases and deaths were higher among males than females up to the ages of 80-84 years, with the highest rates observed in the oldest age group (\u226595 years) for both sexes in 2017. There was a non-linear association between the Socio-demographic Index and the Healthcare Access and Quality Index and age-standardised DALY rates. In 2017, the three largest contributors to DALYs at the global level, for both sexes, were diet low in calcium (20\u00b75% [12\u00b79-28\u00b79]), alcohol use (15\u00b72% [12\u00b71-18\u00b73]), and diet low in milk (14\u00b73% [5\u00b71-24\u00b78]).\nINTERPRETATION: There is substantial global variation in the burden of colorectal cancer. Although the overall colorectal cancer age-standardised death rate has been decreasing at the global level, the increasing age-standardised incidence rate in most countries poses a major public health challenge across the world.

This study was designed to assess the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of pamrevlumab (FG-3019), a fully recombinant human monoclonal antibody against CTGF, in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. The aim was to establish whether pamrevlumab could slow, stop, or reverse progression of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.\nMETHODS: The phase 2, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled PRAISE trial was done at 39 medical centres in seven countries (Australia, Bulgaria, Canada, India, New Zealand, South Africa, and the USA). Patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and percentage of predicted forced vital capacity (FVC) of 55% or greater were enrolled and randomly assigned (1:1) by use of interactive responsive technology to intravenous infusion of pamrevlumab 30 mg/kg or placebo every 3 weeks over 48 weeks (16 infusions). The primary efficacy outcome was change from baseline in percentage of predicted FVC at week 48. Disease progression (defined as a decline from baseline in percentage of predicted FVC of \u226510%, or death) at week 48 was a key secondary efficacy outcome. All patients in the pamrevlumab group received at least one dose of the study drug and were analysed for safety. Two patients in the placebo group were excluded from the intention-to-treat population for the efficacy analyses because of enrolment error. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01890265.\nFINDINGS: Between Aug 17, 2013, and July 21, 2017, 103 patients were randomly assigned (50 to pamrevlumab and 53 to placebo). Pamrevlumab reduced the decline in percentage of predicted FVC by 60\u00b73% at week 48 (mean change from baseline -2\u00b79% with pamrevlumab vs -7\u00b72% with placebo; between-group difference 4\u00b73% [95% CI 0\u00b74-8\u00b73]; p=0\u00b7033). The proportion of patients with disease progression was lower in the pamrevlumab group than in the placebo group at week 48 (10\u00b70% vs 31\u00b74%; p=0\u00b7013). Pamrevlumab was well tolerated, with a safety profile similar to that of placebo. Treatment-emergent serious adverse events were observed in 12 (24%) patients in the pamrevlumab group and eight (15%) in the placebo group, with three patients on pamrevlumab and seven on placebo discontinuing treatment. Of the three (6%) deaths in the pamrevlumab group and six (11%) in the placebo group, none was considered treatment related.\nINTERPRETATION: Pamrevlumab attenuated progression of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and was well tolerated.

Phase II/III randomized controlled trials in adults with IPF were eligible. The random-effect model was implemented calculating the effect size and respective 95% CI as Cohen's d for change from baseline FVC (in percentage predicted and liters) and odds ratio (OR) for 10% reduction in FVC and all-cause mortality (ACM).\nRESULTS: Six studies were included in the MA. For change from baseline in percentage predicted FVC, the MA indicated that the 3 drugs were more effective than placebo (pirfenidone: d=3.30%, 95% CI=2.15-4.45; nintedanib: d=3.15%, 95% CI=2.35-3.95; pamrevlumab: d=4.30%, 95% CI=0.45-8.15).

Intrinsic mechanisms of resistance, such as RAS mutations, can prevent patients from having a response with clinical benefit. The clinical efficacy of EGFR targeted antibodies is limited by the development of acquired (secondary) resistance, which typically occurs within 3-12 months from the start of therapy. Preclinical models and analyses of clinical samples have uncovered some of the alterations that confer a selective advantage to tumor cells when under the pressure of anti-EGFR therapy. Molecular profiling of clinical specimens confirmed that genetic alterations of genes in the EGFR-RAS-RAF-MEK signaling pathway and of receptor tyrosine kinases are mechanisms of acquired resistance to anti-EGFR antibodies. The escape from anti-EGFR blockade appears to converge on the (re)activation of MEK-ERK or AKT as revealed in preclinical studies. Circulating tumor DNA and patient derived xenografts have proven useful tools to monitor patients for resistance to anti-EGFR therapy and test combination therapies to overcome or reverse resistance.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26416732": "Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer worldwide, with 1.2 million patients diagnosed annually. In late-stage colorectal cancer, the most commonly used targeted therapies are the monoclonal antibodies cetuximab and panitumumab, which prevent epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activation. Recent studies have identified alterations in KRAS and other genes as likely mechanisms of primary and secondary resistance to anti-EGFR antibody therapy. Despite these efforts, additional mechanisms of resistance to EGFR blockade are thought to be present in colorectal cancer and little is known about determinants of sensitivity to this therapy. To examine the effect of somatic genetic changes in colorectal cancer on response to anti-EGFR antibody therapy, here we perform complete exome sequence and copy number analyses of 129 patient-derived tumour grafts and targeted genomic analyses of 55 patient tumours, all of which were KRAS wild-type. We analysed the response of tumours to anti-EGFR antibody blockade in tumour graft models and in clinical settings and functionally linked therapeutic responses to mutational data. In addition to previously identified genes, we detected mutations in ERBB2, EGFR, FGFR1, PDGFRA, and MAP2K1 as potential mechanisms of primary resistance to this therapy. Novel alterations in the ectodomain of EGFR were identified in patients with acquired resistance to EGFR blockade. Amplifications and sequence changes in the tyrosine kinase receptor adaptor gene IRS2 were identified in tumours with increased sensitivity to anti-EGFR therapy. Therapeutic resistance to EGFR blockade could be overcome in tumour graft models through combinatorial therapies targeting actionable genes.

Interestingly, DiFi62 cells also acquired resistance to treatment with anti-EGFR mAbs cetuximab and ICR61, which bind to other distinct epitopes on the extracellular domain of EGFR, but these cells remained equally sensitive as the parental cells to treatment with pan-HER inhibitors such as afatinib.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our results provide a novel mechanistic insight into the development of acquired resistance to EGFR antibody-based therapy in colorectal cancer cells and justify further investigations on the therapeutic benefits of pan-HER family inhibitors in the treatment of colorectal cancer patients once acquired resistance to EGFR antibody-based therapy is developed.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36513805": "BACKGROUND: Prognostic biomarker research neonatal sepsis is lacking.

A statistically significant reduction in cytolytic activity was determined during calcium supplementation (from 57% +/- 41% to 32% +/- 30%; P < .05), whereas in the placebo group, it did not change (from 42% +/- 41% to 36% +/- 27%; P > .10).\nCONCLUSIONS: Oral calcium supplementation was shown to cause only a minor nonstatistically significant reduction of epithelial cell proliferation in the rectum, compared with placebo, and to have no effect on the same parameter in the sigmoid and descending colon in first-degree relatives of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer patients.\nIMPLICATION: These results cast doubt on the value of calcium supplementation in the prevention of colorectal cancer, especially in individuals already consuming an adequate amount of dietary calcium.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12621132": "BACKGROUND: Experimental studies in animals and observational studies in humans suggest that regular aspirin use may decrease the risk of colorectal adenomas, the precursors to most colorectal cancers.\nMETHODS: We conducted a randomized, double-blind trial to determine the effect of aspirin on the incidence of colorectal adenomas. We randomly assigned 635 patients with previous colorectal cancer to receive either 325 mg of aspirin per day or placebo. We determined the proportion of patients with adenomas, the number of recurrent adenomas, and the time to the development of adenoma between randomization and subsequent colonoscopic examinations. Relative risks were adjusted for age, sex, cancer stage, the number of colonoscopic examinations, and the time to a first colonoscopy. The study was terminated early by an independent data and safety monitoring board when statistically significant results were reported during a planned interim analysis.\nRESULTS: A total of 517 randomized patients had at least one colonoscopic examination a median of 12.8 months after randomization. One or more adenomas were found in 17 percent of patients in the aspirin group and 27 percent of patients in the placebo group (P=0.004). The mean (+/-SD) number of adenomas was lower in the aspirin group than the placebo group (0.30+/-0.87 vs. 0.49+/-0.99, P=0.003 by the Wilcoxon test). The adjusted relative risk of any recurrent adenoma in the aspirin group, as compared with the placebo group, was 0.65 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.46 to 0.91). The time to the detection of a first adenoma was longer in the aspirin group than in the placebo group (hazard ratio for the detection of a new polyp, 0.64; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.43 to 0.94; P=0.022).\nCONCLUSIONS: Daily use of aspirin is associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of colorectal adenomas in patients with previous colorectal cancer.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21307305": "BACKGROUND: Intake of aspirin is associated with reduction in risk of colorectal adenoma and carcinoma. Some plants contain salicylates, and individuals not taking aspirin may have measurable salicylate levels. However, the association between serum salicylate level and recurrence of adenoma in nonusers of aspirin has not been studied.\nMETHODS: We measured serum salicylate levels in participants in a randomized controlled trial with calcium supplementation for the prevention of colorectal adenomas. Generalized linear models were used to assess the association between serum levels and adenoma risk during the follow-up period of the trial.\nRESULTS: We did not find an association with recurrence of adenomas or advanced adenomas with serum salicylate levels at year 1 among nonusers of aspirin. There was no effect modification of the chemopreventive effect of calcium supplementation in reducing risk of recurrent adenomas or advanced adenomas.\nCONCLUSIONS: Among nonusers of ASA, serum salicylate levels are not associated with risk of recurrence of adenomas.\nIMPACT: Serum salicylate levels can be detected in individuals not taking aspirin, but the levels may be too low to confer protection from risk of recurrent adenomas.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8625297": "Regular aspirin intake may reduce the risk of colorectal cancer by 50%. However, the mechanism of this chemopreventive effect is not known. The effect of the aspirin metabolite salicylate on the growth of human colorectal tumor cell lines was determined. Salicylate showed dose-dependent inhibitory effects on all of the cell lines (IC50, 1.65 +/- 0.36 to 7.38 +/- 1.08 mM), yet carcinoma and in vitro-transformed adenoma cell lines were more sensitive than adenoma cell lines. Salicylate caused all cell lines to accumulate in G0-G1 and induced apoptosis in carcinoma and in vitro-transformed adenoma cell lines but not in all adenoma cell lines. In those adenoma lines that did show salicylate-induced apoptosis, the extent was considerably less than that in the more transformed cell lines. The ability of salicylate to induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis and, in particular, the increased sensitivity of cells at later stages of neoplastic progression may be mechanistically important in the chemopreventive action of aspirin toward colorectal cancer.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2380401": "A change in sialic acid, notably loss of O acetyl substitution, was studied histochemically in a series of 93 colorectal adenomas that included 14 malignant polyps. Changes in sialic acid were uncommon in adenomas showing mild dysplasia but became increasingly common in moderately and severely dysplastic adenomas and were always present in carcinomatous areas. There was no correlation between a change in sialic acid and either size or villous architecture of benign adenomas. As mucin change often preceded the development of invasive cancer, it could not be used on its own to distinguish between epithelial displacement (pseudoinvasion) and malignant invasion. An abundant luminal accumulation of altered sialic acid in association with an epithelial lining that was non-mucin secreting, however, was specific for cancer. Conversely, the presence of unchanged intracellular or intraluminal O-acetyl sialic acid may help to exclude a diagnosis of malignancy in equivocal cases. The change is not specific for colorectal neoplasms and probably represents a metaplasia to a small intestinal phenotype.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26404953": "BACKGROUND & AIMS: Chemopreventive strategies might be used to reduce the recurrence of colorectal adenomas and the incidence of colorectal cancer. We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to determine whether a combination of acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), calcitriol, and calcium carbonate could prevent colorectal adenoma recurrence.\nMETHODS: We included 1107 patients with 1 or more sporadic adenoma(s) removed from the colon or rectum at centers in Europe, Russia, or the United States, from 2004 through 2010. Inclusion criteria were 1 adenoma greater than 1 cm in diameter, more than 1 adenoma of any size, or an adenoma of any size and first-degree relatives with colorectal cancer. Subjects were assigned randomly to groups given 0.5 \u03bcg calcitriol, 75 mg acetylsalicylic acid, and 1250 mg calcium carbonate (n\u00a0= 209), or placebo (n\u00a0= 218), each day for 3 years. The primary outcome was adenoma recurrence assessed by colonoscopy after 3 years. Secondary outcomes were the proportion of patients with advanced adenomas, the total number of colorectal adenomas, and adenoma size and features.\nRESULTS: The trial was stopped in October 2010 because of futility. In this analysis, we found no differences between groups in the rate of recurrence (odds ratio [OR], 0.95; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.61-1.48), adverse effects, or secondary outcomes. Subgroup analyses indicated that the treatment effects may be influenced by smoking status (nonsmokers OR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.26-1.22 vs current smokers OR, 1.70; 95% CI, 0.70-4.09; P value interaction < .05). However, the overall interaction was not significant.\nCONCLUSIONS: In a prospective study, the combination of calcitriol, aspirin, and calcium carbonate did not prevent recurrence of colorectal adenomas over a 3-year period. The negative results might be owing to the effects of smoking or low doses of the tested agents. Clinicaltrials.gov number: NCT00486512."}
