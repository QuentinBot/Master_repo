The rimmed vacuoles and intranuclear inclusions in myofibers constitute the pathological hallmark of OPDM. In this review, the latest findings related to the genetic, molecular and clinical features of OPDM, as well as the diagnosis and management are summarized.\nRECENT FINDINGS: Four gene mutations, CGG repeats in the 5'-untranslated region of LRP12 , GIPC1 , NOTCH2NLC and RILPL1 have been reported to be disease-causing genes in OPDM, namely OPDM1, OPDM2, OPDM3 and OPDM4, accordingly. So far, limited studies have suggested that CGG repeat expansion within the pathogenic range may play a key role in the pathogenesis of OPDM with the gain-of-function mechanism at the RNA and/or protein level, while repeat expansion over a threshold limit may cause hypermethylation, leading to the transcriptional silencing of the CGG repeats in the expanded allele, which results in the existence of mild phenotype or asymptomatic carriers.\nSUMMARY: Novel gene mutations, possible molecular mechanisms and the clinical features related to different causative genes are discussed in this review.

OPMD is usually transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait (OMIM 164300). A rarer allelic autosomal recessive form has also been observed (OMIM 257950). Both forms are caused by short (GCG)8-13 expansions in the polyadenylate-binding protein nuclear 1 gene (PABPN1) located on chromosome 14q11.1. The mutations cause the lengthening of an N-terminal polyalanine domain. Both slippage and unequal recombination have been proposed as the mutation mechanisms. The size of the mutation has not yet been conclusively shown to inversely correlate with the severity of the phenotype. Mutated PABPN1 proteins have been shown to be constituents of the INIs. The INIs also contain ubiquitin, proteasome subunits, HSP 40, HSP 70, SKIP, and abundant poly(A)-mRNA. The exact mechanism responsible for polyalanine toxicity in OPMD is unknown. Various intranuclear inclusion dependent and independent mechanisms have been proposed based on the major known function of PABPN1 in polyadenylation of mRNA and its shuttling from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. OPMD is one of the few triplet-repeat diseases for which the function of the mutated gene is known. Because of the increasing number of diseases caused by polyalanine expansions and the pathological overlap with CAG/polyglutamine diseases, what pathological insight is gained by the study of OPMD could lead to a better understanding of a much larger group of developmental and degenerative diseases.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29725764": "Dysphagia is one of the primary symptoms experienced by individuals with Oculopharyngeal Muscular Dystrophy (OPMD). However, we lack understanding of the discrete changes in swallowing physiology that are seen in OPMD, and the resulting relationship to impairments of swallowing safety and efficiency. This study sought to describe the pathophysiology of dysphagia in a small sample of patients with OPMD using a videofluoroscopy examination (VFSS) involving 3\u2009\u00d7\u20095\u00a0mL boluses of thin\u00a0liquid barium (22% w/v). The aim of this study is to extend what is known about the pathophysiology of dysphagia in OPMD, by quantifying changes in swallow timing, kinematics, safety, and efficiency, measured from VFSS. This study is a secondary analysis of baseline VFSS collected from 11 adults (4 male), aged 48-62 (mean 57) enrolled in an industry-sponsored phase 2 therapeutic drug trial. Blinded raters scored the VFSS recordings for safety [Penetration-Aspiration Scale (PAS)], efficiency [Normalized Residue Ratio Scale (NRRS)], timing [Pharyngeal Transit Time (PTT), Swallow Reaction Time (SRT), Laryngeal Vestibule Closure Reaction Time (LVCrt), Upper Esophageal Sphincter Opening Duration (UESD)], and kinematics (hyoid movement, pharyngeal constriction, UES opening width). Impairment thresholds from existing literature were defined to characterize swallowing physiology and function. Further, Fisher's Exact tests and Pearson's correlations were used to conduct a preliminary exploration of associations between swallowing physiology (e.g., kinematics, timing) and function (i.e., safety, efficiency). Compared to published norms, we identified significant differences in the degree of maximum pharyngeal constriction, hyoid movement distance and speed, as well as degree and timeliness of airway closure. Unsafe swallowing (PAS\u2009\u2265\u20093) was seen in only 3/11 patients. By contrast, clinically significant residue (i.e., NRRS scores\u2009\u2265\u20090.09 vallecular;\u2009\u2265\u20090.2 pyriform) was seen in 7/11 patients. Fisher's Exact tests revealed associations between prolonged SRT, PTT, and unsafe swallowing. Weak associations were also identified between post-swallow residue and poor pharyngeal constriction during the swallow. Detailed analysis of swallowing physiology in this series of adults with OPMD aligns with impaired muscular function (e.g., reduced pharyngeal constriction, incomplete laryngeal vestibule closure) associated with the disease, and primary functional challenges with swallow efficiency.

Their features, including high stability and secretion to biofluids, make them attractive as potential biomarkers for diverse pathologies. This is the first study reporting miRNA as potential biomarkers for oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD), an adult-onset myopathy. We hypothesized that miRNA that is differentially expressed in affected muscles from OPMD patients is secreted to biofluids and those miRNAs could be used as biomarkers for OPMD. We first identified candidate miRNAs from OPMD-affected muscles and from muscles from an OPMD mouse model using RNA sequencing. We then compared the OPMD-deregulated miRNAs to the literature and, subsequently, we selected a few candidates for expression studies in serum and saliva biofluids using qRT-PCR. We identified 126 miRNAs OPMD-deregulated in human muscles, but 36 deregulated miRNAs in mice only (pFDR &lt; 0.05). Only 15 OPMD-deregulated miRNAs overlapped between the in humans and mouse studies. The majority of the OPMD-deregulated miRNAs showed opposite deregulation direction compared with known muscular dystrophies miRNAs (myoMirs), which are associated. In contrast, similar dysregulation direction was found for 13 miRNAs that are common between OPMD and aging muscles. A significant age-association (p &lt; 0.05) was found for 17 OPMD-deregulated miRNAs (13.4%), whereas in controls, only six miRNAs (1.4%) showed a significant age-association, suggesting that miRNA expression in OPMD is highly age-associated. miRNA expression in biofluids revealed that OPMD-associated deregulation in saliva was similar to that in muscles, but not in serum. The same as in muscle, miRNA expression levels in saliva were also found to be associated with age (p &lt; 0.05). Moreover, the majority of OPMD-miRNAs were found to be associated with dysphagia as an initial symptom.

Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is caused by a small expansion of the polyalanine tract in the poly(A)-binding protein nuclear 1 (PABPN1). Aggregation of expanded PABPN1 into intranuclear inclusions (INIs) in skeletal muscle fibers is the pathological hallmark of OPMD. In this study what we have analyzed in muscle fibers of OPMD patients and in primary cultures of human myoblasts are the relationships between nuclear speckles and INIs, and the contribution of the former to the biogenesis of the latter. While nuclear speckles concentrate snRNP splicing factors and PABPN1 in control muscle fibers, they are depleted of PABPN1 and appear closely associated with INIs in muscle fibers of OPMD patients. The induction of INI formation in human myoblasts expressing either wild type GFP-PABPN1 or expanded GFP-PABPN1-17ala demonstrates that the initial aggregation of PABPN1 proteins and their subsequent growth in INIs occurs at the edges of the nuclear speckles. Moreover, the growing of INIs gradually depletes PABPN1 proteins and poly(A) RNA from nuclear speckles, although the existence of these nuclear compartments is preserved. Time-lapse experiments in cultured myoblasts confirm nuclear speckles as biogenesis sites of PABPN1 inclusions. Given the functional importance of nuclear speckles in the post-transcriptional processing of pre-mRNAs, the INI-dependent molecular reorganization of these nuclear compartments in muscle fibers may cause a severe dysfunction in nuclear trafficking and processing of polyadenylated mRNAs, thereby contributing to the molecular pathophysiology of OPMD.

These disorders are primarily determined by identified hereditable mutations, but their late-onset symptom manifestation is not fully understood. Here, we review recent research developments on the late-onset autosomal dominant oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD). OPMD is caused by an expansion mutation in the gene encoding for poly-adenylate RNA binding protein1 (PABPN1). The molecular pathogenesis for the disease is still poorly understood. Despite a ubiquitous expression of PABPN1, symptoms in OPMD are limited to skeletal muscles. We discuss recent studies showing that PABPN1 levels in skeletal muscles are lower compared with other tissues, and specifically in skeletal muscles, PABPN1 expression declines from midlife onward. In OPMD, aggregation of expanded PABPN1 causes an additional decline in the level of the functional protein, which is associated with severe muscle weakness in OPMD. Reduced PABNPN1 expression in muscle cell culture causes myogenic defects, suggesting that PABPN1 loss-of-function causes muscle weakness in OPMD and in the elderly. Molecular signatures of OPMD muscles are similar to those of normal muscle aging, although expression trends progress faster in OPMD. We discuss a working hypothesis that aging-associated factors trigger late-onset symptoms in OPMD, and contribute to accelerated muscle weakness in OPMD. We focus on the pharyngeal and eyelid muscles, which are often affected in OPMD patients.

OPMD is due to extension of a polyalanine tract in poly(A) binding protein nuclear 1 (PABPN1). Aggregation of the mutant protein in muscle nuclei is a hallmark of the disease. Previous transcriptomic analyses revealed the consistent deregulation of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) in OPMD animal models and patients, suggesting a role of this deregulation in OPMD pathogenesis. Subsequent studies proposed that UPS contribution to OPMD involved PABPN1 aggregation. Here, we use a Drosophila model of OPMD to address the functional importance of UPS deregulation in OPMD. Through genome-wide and targeted genetic screens we identify a large number of UPS components that are involved in OPMD. Half dosage of UPS genes reduces OPMD muscle defects suggesting a pathological increase of UPS activity in the disease. Quantification of proteasome activity confirms stronger activity in OPMD muscles, associated with degradation of myofibrillar proteins. Importantly, improvement of muscle structure and function in the presence of UPS mutants does not correlate with the levels of PABPN1 aggregation, but is linked to decreased degradation of muscle proteins. Oral treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 is beneficial to the OPMD Drosophila model, improving muscle function although PABPN1 aggregation is enhanced. This functional study reveals the importance of increased UPS activity that underlies muscle atrophy in OPMD. It also provides a proof-of-concept that inhibitors of proteasome activity might be an attractive pharmacological approach for OPMD.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16333769": "Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is an autosomal dominant muscle disorder, usually of late onset.

Strikingly, the polyalanine tract is not absolutely required for muscle degeneration, whereas another domain of PABPN1, the RNA-binding domain and its function in RNA binding are required. This demonstrates that OPMD does not result from polyalanine toxicity, but from an intrinsic property of PABPN1. We also identify several suppressors of the OPMD phenotype.

Functional and histological analysis of the skeletal muscle of this mouse model confirmed a severe and progressive muscular atrophy associated with a reduction in muscle strength. Moreover, muscle atrophy in the A17.1 mice was restricted to fast glycolytic fibres, containing a large number of intranuclear inclusions (INIs).

In these models, increased apoptosis is seen, but it is unclear whether this process mediates OPMD. The role of apoptosis in the pathogenesis of different muscular dystrophies is unclear. Blocking apoptosis ameliorates muscle disease in some mouse models of muscular dystrophy such as laminin \u03b1-2-deficient mice, but not in others such as dystrophin-deficient (mdx) mice.

This disease is of late-onset, but the underlying mechanism is unclear. Ca2+ stimulates muscle growth and contraction and, because OPMD courses with muscle atrophy and weakness, we hypothesized that the homeostasis of Ca2+ is altered in this disorder. C2C12 myotubes were transfected with cDNAs encoding either PABPN1 or the PABPN1-17A OPMD mutation. Subsequently, they were investigated concerning not only excitation-contraction coupling (ECC) and intracellular levels of Ca2+ , but also differentiation stage and nuclear structure. PABPN1-17A gave rise to: inhibition of Ca2+ release during ECC, depletion of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ content, reduced expression of ryanodine receptors, altered nuclear morphology and incapability to stimulate myoblast fusion. PABPN1-17A failed to inhibit ECC in adult muscle fibres, suggesting that its effects are primarily related to muscle regeneration.\nABSTRACT: Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is linked to mutations in the gene encoding poly(A)-binding protein nuclear 1 (PABPN1). OPMD mutations consist of an expansion of a tract that contains 10\u00a0alanines (to 12-17). This disease courses with muscle weakness that begins in adulthood, but the underlying mechanism is unclear. In the present study, we investigated the functional effects of PABPN1 and an OPMD mutation (PABPN1-17A) using myotubes transfected with cDNAs encoding these proteins (GFP-tagged). PABPN1 stimulated myoblast fusion (100%), whereas PABPN1-17A failed to mimic this effect. Additionally, the OPMD mutation markedly altered nuclear morphology; specifically, it led to nuclei with a more convoluted and ovoid shape. Although PABPN1 and PABPN1-17A modified the expression of sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ -ATPase and calsequestrin, the corresponding changes did not have a clear impact on [Ca2+ ]. Interestingly, neither L-type Ca2+ channels, nor voltage-gated sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ release (VGCR) was altered by PABPN1. However, PABPN1-17A produced a selective inhibition of VGCR (50%). This effect probably arises from both lower expression of RyR1 and depletion of SR Ca2+ . The latter, however, was not related to inhibition of store-operated Ca2+ entry. Both PABPN1 constructs promoted a moderated decrease in cytosolic [Ca2+ ], which apparently results from down-regulation of excitation-coupled Ca2+ entry. On the other hand, PABPN1-17A did not alter ECC in muscle fibres, suggesting that adult muscle is less prone to developing deleterious effects. These results demonstrate that PABPN1 proteins regulate essential processes during myotube formation and support the notion that OPMD involves disruption of myogenesis, nuclear structure and homeostasis of Ca2+ .", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11139982": "Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is an autosomal dominant myopathy with almost benign course.

Some family members with or without OPMD complained of exercise related muscle pain, and a lipid storage myopathy with low muscular carnitine concentrations was found, while the carnitine contents in blood and urine samples as well as the activity of the carnitine-palmitoyl-transferase were normal, fitting the pattern of a primary muscular carnitine deficiency, independent of OPMD.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12945950": "BACKGROUND: Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is an adult-onset disorder characterized by progressive ptosis, dysphagia and proximal limb weakness. The autosomal dominant form of this disease is caused by short expansions of a (GCG)6 repeat to (GCG) in the PABPN1 gene. The mutations lead to the expansion of a polyalanine stretch from 10 to 12-17 alanines in the N-terminus of PABPN1. The mutated PABPN1 (mPABPN1) induces the formation of intranuclear filamentous inclusions that sequester poly(A) RNA and are associated with cell death.\nMETHODS: Human fetal brain cDNA library was used to look for PABPNI binding proteins using yeast two-hybrid screen. The protein interaction was confirmed by GST pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation assays. Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy cellular model and OPMD patient muscle tissue were used to check whether the PABPN1 binding proteins were involved in the formation of OPMD intranuclear inclusions.\nRESULTS: We identify two PABPNI interacting proteins, hnRNP A1 and hnRNP A/B. When co-expressed with mPABPN1 in COS-7 cells, predominantly nuclear protein hnRNP A1 and A/B co-localize with mPABPN1 in the insoluble intranuclear aggregates. Patient studies showed that hnRNP A1 is sequestered in OPMD nuclear inclusions.\nCONCLUSIONS: The hnRNP proteins are involved in mRNA processing and mRNA nucleocytoplasmic export, sequestering of hnRNPs in OPMD intranuclear aggregates supports the view that OPMD intranuclear inclusions are \"poly(A) RNA traps\", which would interfere with RNA export, and cause muscle cell death.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28590779": "AIM: We have previously described two unrelated Bukhara Jews (BJs) with a combination of oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) and inherited retinal dystrophy (IRD), because of mutations in two linked genes: PABPN1 and NRL.

We examined this in a Dutch cohort including presymptomatic Ala-expanded-PABPN1 carriers and late symptomatic patients.\nMETHODS: We performed a prospective, observational study in OPMD patients and adult children of genetically confirmed OPMD patients. The study includes a structured history, a detailed neurological examination, muscle histology and biochemical analysis. Forty patients and 18 adult children participated in this study, among whom were six presymptomatic mutation carriers. One patient died during the study and had given permission to autopsy.\nRESULTS: In addition to the characteristic OPMD symptoms including ptosis and dysphagia, other symptoms such as limb girdle and axial weakness, and external ophthalmoplegia were frequently observed. Intranuclear aggregates were observed in the biopsies of presymptomatic carriers. Biochemical analysis of the biopsies of the presymptomatic carriers showed no mitochondrial dysfunction. The autopsy showed that muscle weakness correlated with histopathological findings in five different muscles in an individual patient.\nCONCLUSIONS: The main findings of this nationwide study are the presence of intranuclear aggregates before clinical onset and the absence of mitochondrial changes in Ala-expanded-PABPN1 carriers. This indicates that the expression of Ala-expanded-PABPN1 causes the formation of nuclear aggregates before the onset of muscle weakness. Normal results of biochemical analysis in presymptomatic carriers suggest that possible mitochondrial dysfunction occurs later.

Primary muscular targets of OPMD are the eyelid elevator and pharyngeal muscles, including the cricopharyngeal muscle (CPM), the progressive involution of which leads to ptosis and dysphagia, respectively. To understand the consequences of PABPN1 polyalanine expansion in OPMD, we studied muscle biopsies from 14 OPMD patients, 3 inclusion body myositis patients, and 9 healthy controls. In OPMD patient CPM (n = 6), there were typical dystrophic features with extensive endomysial fibrosis and marked atrophy of myosin heavy-chain IIa fibers. There were more PAX7-positive cells in all CPM versus other muscles (n = 5, control; n = 3, inclusion body myositis), and they were more numerous in OPMD CPM versus control normal CPM without any sign of muscle regeneration. Intranuclear inclusions were present in all OPMD muscles but unaffected OPMD patient muscles (i.e. sternocleidomastoid, quadriceps, or deltoid; n = 14) did not show evidence of fibrosis, atrophy, or increased PAX7-positive cell numbers.

By a multidisciplinary approach, including confocal microscopy, Western blot, and quantitative PCR analyses on muscle biopsies from patients and unaffected individuals, we found a significant increase in let-7 expression in OPMD muscles associated with an unusual high percentage of paired box 7-positive satellite cells.

OPMD is caused by the abnormal expansion of a (GCG)n trinucleotide repeat in the coding region of the poly-(A) binding protein nuclear 1 (PABPN1) gene.

Here, we present the first global proteomic analysis of the protein interactions of WT and alanine-expanded PABPN1 in skeletal muscle tissue. These data provide both insight into the function of PABPN1 in muscle and evidence that the alanine expansion alters the protein-protein interactions of PABPN1.

Descriptive statistics was used for all outcomes and logistic regression to investigate predictors of abnormal swallowing.\nRESULTS: Eighty-two percent reported difficulties with swallowing, 27% with chewing and 67% with speaking. Patients performed significantly worse on all oropharyngeal tests compared to age-matched controls except for bite force. Also asymptomatic carriers performed worse than controls: on chewing time, swallowing speed and articulation rate. During videofluoroscopy, all patients (except one asymptomatic) had abnormal residue and 19% aspirated.

Fibrotic muscles often exhibit thickening of the extracellular matrix (ECM). The molecular regulation of this process is not fully understood. In oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD), an expansion of an alanine tract at the N-terminus of poly(A)-binding protein nuclear 1 (PABPN1) causes muscle symptoms. OPMD patient muscle degeneration initiates after midlife, while at an earlier age carriers of alanine expansion mutant PABPN1 (expPABPN1) are clinically pre-symptomatic. OPMD is characterized by fibrosis in skeletal muscles but the causative molecular mechanisms are not fully understood.\nMETHODS: We studied the molecular processes that are involved in OPMD pathology using cross-species mRNA expression profiles in muscles from patients and model systems. We identified significant dysregulation of the ECM functional group, among which the procollagen C-endopeptidase enhancer 1 gene (PCOLCE) was consistently down-regulated across species. We investigated PCOLCE subcellular localization in OPMD muscle samples and OPMD model systems to investigate any functional relevance of PCOLCE down-regulation in this disease.\nRESULTS: We found that muscle degeneration in OPMD is associated with PCOLCE down-regulation. In addition to its known presence at the ECM, we also found PCOLCE within the nucleus of muscle cells. PCOLCE sub-cellular localization changes during myoblast cell fusion and is disrupted in cells expressing mutant expPABPN1. Our results show that PCOLCE binds to soluble PABPN1 and co-localizes with aggregated PABPN1 with a preference for the mutant protein. In muscle biopsies from OPMD patients we find that extracellular PCOLCE is depleted with its concomitant enrichment within the nuclear compartment.\nCONCLUSIONS: PCOLCE regulates collagen processing at the ECM. Depletion of extracellular PCOLCE is associated with the expression of expPABPN1 in OPMD patient muscles. PCOLCE is also localized within the nucleus where it binds to PABPN1, suggesting that PCOLCE shuttles between the ECM and the nucleus. PCOLCE preferentially binds to expPABPN1. Nuclear-localized PCOLCE is enriched in muscle cells expressing expPABPN1.

We report an age-regulated decline in PABPN1 levels in Vastus lateralis muscles from the fifth decade. In concurrence with severe muscle degeneration in OPMD, the decline in PABPN1 accelerated in OPMD and was specific to skeletal muscles.

While the roles of PABPN1 in nuclear polyadenylation and regulation of alternative poly(A) site choice are established, the molecular mechanisms behind OPMD remain undetermined. Here, we show, using Drosophila and mouse models, that OPMD pathogenesis depends on affected poly(A) tail lengths of specific mRNAs. We identify a set of mRNAs encoding mitochondrial proteins that are down-regulated starting at the earliest stages of OPMD progression. The down-regulation of these mRNAs correlates with their shortened poly(A) tails and partial rescue of their levels when deadenylation is genetically reduced improves muscle function. Genetic analysis of candidate genes encoding RNA binding proteins using the Drosophila OPMD model uncovers a potential role of a number of them. We focus on the deadenylation regulator Smaug and show that it is expressed in adult muscles and specifically binds to the down-regulated mRNAs. In addition, the first step of the cleavage and polyadenylation reaction, mRNA cleavage, is affected in muscles expressing alanine-expanded PABPN1. We propose that impaired cleavage during nuclear cleavage/polyadenylation is an early defect in OPMD. This defect followed by active deadenylation of specific mRNAs, involving Smaug and the CCR4-NOT deadenylation complex, leads to their destabilization and mitochondrial dysfunction.

Affected muscles are characterized by increased fibrosis and atrophy. Myostatin is a negative regulator of muscle mass, and inhibition of myostatin has been demonstrated to ameliorate symptoms in dystrophic muscles.\nMETHODS: In this study, we performed a systemic delivery of a monoclonal antibody to immunologically block myostatin in the A17 mouse model of OPMD. The mice were administered a weekly dose of 10 mg/kg RK35 intraperitonially for 10 weeks, following which histological analyses were performed on the samples.\nRESULTS: This treatment significantly (P < 0.01) improved body mass (11%) and muscle mass (for the tibialis anterior and extensor digitorum longus by 19% and 41%) in the A17 mice treated with RK35 when compared to saline controls. Similarly, a significantly (P < 0.01) increased muscle strength (18% increase in maximal tetanic force) and myofibre diameter (17% and 44% for the tibialis anterior and extensor digitorum longus), and reduced expression of markers of muscle fibrosis (40% reduction in area of expression), was also observed. No change in the density of intranuclear inclusions (a hallmark of disease progression of OPMD) was however observed.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our study supports the clinical translation of such antibody-mediated inhibition of myostatin as a treatment of OPMD.

The mutation consists of a short meiotically stable trinucleotide repeat in the first exon of PABPN1 gene. We have investigated Dutch OPMD patients from four unrelated families and identified a new mutation in two of the four families. Instead of a repeat expansion we found a duplication in the first exon of the PABPN1 gene (c.27_28ins12, p.11_12insAAAA).

The autosomal dominant form of the disease is caused by short (GCG)(8-13) expansions in the PABP2 gene. This gene encodes the poly(A) binding protein 2 (PABP2), an abundant nuclear protein that binds with high affinity to nascent poly(A) tails, stimulating their extension and controlling their length. In this work we report that PABP2 is detected in filamentous nuclear inclusions, which are the pathological hallmark of OPMD. Using both immunoelectron microscopy and fluorescence confocal microscopy, the OPMD-specific nuclear inclusions appeared decorated by anti-PABP2 antibodies. In addition, the inclusions were labeled with antibodies directed against ubiquitin and the subunits of the proteasome and contained a form of PABP2 that was more resistant to salt extraction than the protein dispersed in the nucleoplasm. This suggests that the polyalanine expansions in PABP2 induce a misfolding and aggregation of the protein into insoluble inclusions, similarly to events in neurodegenerative diseases caused by CAG/polyglutamine expansions. No significant differences were observed in the steady-state poly(A) tail length in OPMD and normal myoblasts. However, the nuclear inclusions were shown to sequester poly(A) RNA.

Patients 18 to 75 years of age were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive placebo or dersimelagon at a dose of 100 or 300 mg once daily for 16 weeks. The primary end point was the change from baseline to week 16 in the time to the first prodromal symptom associated with sunlight exposure.

Microarray-based gene expression analysis and serum protein profiling were performed in the BLM-induced SSc models. The effect of MT-7117 on transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2)-induced activation of human dermal fibroblasts was evaluated in vitro. Immunohistochemical analyses of MC1R expression in the skin of SSc patients were performed.\nRESULTS: Prophylactic treatment with MT-7117 (\u2265 0.3 mg/kg/day p.o.) significantly inhibited skin fibrosis and lung inflammation, and therapeutic treatment with MT-7117 (\u2265 3 mg/kg/day p.o.) significantly suppressed the development of skin fibrosis in the BLM-induced SSc models. Gene array analysis demonstrated that MT-7117 exerts an anti-inflammatory effect via suppression of the activation of inflammatory cells and inflammation-related signals; additionally, vascular dysfunction was extracted as the pathology targeted by MT-7117. Serum protein profiling revealed that multiple SSc-related biomarkers including P-selectin, osteoprotegerin, cystatin C, growth and differentiation factor-15, and S100A9 were suppressed by MT-7117.

Our multidisciplinary approach in this study demonstrates that Khosta-1 and -2 currently appear to be not dangerous with low risk of spillover, as confirmed by prevalence data and by phylogenomic reconstruction. In addition, the interaction between Khosta-1 and -2 with ACE2 appears weak, and furin cleavage sites are absent.

Although many studies have concluded that domestic pigs play an important role in the transmission cycle of JEV, and infection of humans, the role of feral pigs in the transmission of JEV remains unclear. Since domestic and feral pigs are the same species, and because feral pig populations in the United States are increasing and expanding geographically, the current study aimed to test the hypothesis that if JEV were introduced into the United States, feral pigs might play a role in the transmission cycle. Materials and Methods: Sinclair miniature pigs, that exhibit the feral phenotype, were intradermally inoculated with JEV genotype Ib. These pigs were derived from crossing miniature domestic pig with four strains of feral pigs and were used since obtaining feral swine was not possible. Results: The Sinclair miniature pigs became viremic and displayed pathological outcomes similar to those observed in domestic swine. Conclusion: Based on these findings, we conclude that in the event of JEV being introduced into the United States, feral pig populations could contribute to establishment and maintenance of a transmission cycle of JEV and could lead to the virus becoming endemic in the United States.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28555073": "Zoonotic spillover, which is the transmission of a pathogen from a vertebrate animal to a human, presents a global public health burden but is a poorly understood phenomenon.

In this Opinion article, we propose a synthetic framework for animal-to-human transmission that integrates the relevant mechanisms. This framework reveals that all zoonotic pathogens must overcome a hierarchical series of barriers to cause spillover infections in humans.

The factors leading to such spillover events are little explored. Filoviridae viruses have a wide range of natural hosts and are unstable once outside hosts. Spillover events, which involve the physical transfer of viral particles across species, could therefore be directly promoted by conditions of host ecology and environment. In this report, we outline a proof of concept that temporal fluctuations of a set of ecological and environmental variables describing the dynamics of the host ecosystem are able to predict such events of Ebola virus spillover to humans and animals. We compiled a data set of climate and plant phenology variables and Ebola virus disease spillovers in humans and animals. We identified critical biotic and abiotic conditions for spillovers via multiple regression and neural network-based time series regression. Phenology variables proved to be overall better predictors than climate variables. African phenology variables are not yet available as a comprehensive online resource.

Most human emerging infectious diseases originate from non-human animals, and human-related environmental disturbances are the driving forces of the emergence of new human pathogens. Synthesizing the sequence of basic events involved in the emergence of new human pathogens is important for guiding the understanding, identification, and description of key aspects of human activities that can be changed to prevent new outbreaks, epidemics, and pandemics. This review synthesizes the connections between environmental disturbances and increased risk of spillover events based on the One Health perspective. Anthropogenic disturbances in the environment (e.g., deforestation, habitat fragmentation, biodiversity loss, wildlife exploitation) lead to changes in ecological niches, reduction of the dilution effect, increased contact between humans and other animals, changes in the incidence and load of pathogens in animal populations, and alterations in the abiotic factors of landscapes. These phenomena can increase the risk of spillover events and, potentially, facilitate new infectious disease outbreaks.

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is the continuation of virus spillover events that have taken place over the last few decades, particularly in Asia and Africa. Therefore, these bat-associated epidemics provide a significant number of hints, including respiratory cellular tropism, more intense susceptibility to these cell types, and overall likely to become a pandemic for the next spillover. In this systematic review, we analysed data to insight, through bat-originated spillover in Asia and Africa. We used STATA/IC-13 software for descriptive statistics and meta-analysis.

Similarly, the Ebola virus was detected in the African continent with neurological disorders in humans, like Nipah, seen in the Asian region. Two important coronaviruses, MERS and SARS, were introduced, both with the potential to infect respiratory passages.

This hypothesis is largely based on suspected higher rates of zoonotic disease spillover and emergence in fragmented landscapes and other areas where humans live in close vicinity to wildlife. For example, Ebola virus outbreaks have been linked to contacts between humans and infected wildlife at the rural-forest border, and spillover of yellow fever via mosquito vectors happens at the interface between forest and human settlements. Because spillover involves complex interactions between multiple species and is difficult to observe directly, empirical studies are scarce, particularly those that quantify underlying mechanisms. In this review, we identify and explore potential ecological mechanisms affecting spillover of pathogens (and parasites in general) at ecosystem boundaries. We borrow the concept of 'permeability' from animal movement ecology as a measure of the likelihood that hosts and parasites are present in an ecosystem boundary region. We then discuss how different mechanisms operating at the levels of organisms and ecosystems might affect permeability and spillover. This review is a step towards developing a general theory of cross-species parasite spillover across ecosystem boundaries with the eventual aim of improving predictions of spillover risk in heterogeneous landscapes.

One approach to estimating spillover is to directly correlate observed spillover events with covariates. An alternative is to mechanistically combine information on host density, distribution and pathogen prevalence to predict where and when spillover events are expected to occur. We use several case studies at the wildlife-livestock disease interface to highlight the challenges, and potential solutions, to estimating spatio-temporal variation in spillover risk. Datasets on multiple host species often do not align in space, time or resolution, and may have no estimates of observation error. Linking these datasets requires they be related to a common spatial and temporal resolution and appropriately propagating errors in predictions can be difficult. Hierarchical models are one potential solution, but for fine-resolution predictions at broad spatial scales, many models become computationally challenging. Despite these limitations, the confrontation of mechanistic predictions with observed events is an important avenue for developing a better understanding of pathogen spillover. Systems where data have been collected at all levels in the spillover process are rare, or non-existent, and require investment and sustained effort across disciplines.

Blood flukes belonging to the species Spirorchis elegans were found inhabiting the vascular system of 3 turtles, while numerous fluke eggs were trapped in the vascular system, brain, lung, heart, liver, kidney, spleen, and/or gastrointestinal tissues of all necropsied animals. Characteristic lesions included miliary egg granulomas, which were mostly found on serosal surfaces, particularly of the small intestine, as well as endocarditis, arteritis, and thrombosis. The most probable cause of death in the 3 turtle specimens which were also examined histologically was a necrotic enteritis with secondary bacterial infection associated with a massive egg embolism. The North American origin of S. elegans, the absence of prior recorded epizootics in the outbreak area, and the habitual presence of its type host, the highly invasive red-eared slider, in this area suggest a new case of parasite spillover resulting in a severe emerging disease.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16358422": "Etiologic agents of arboviral diseases are primarily zoonotic pathogens that are maintained in nature in cycles involving arthropod transmission among a variety of susceptible reservoir hosts. In the simplest form of human exposure, spillover occurs from the enzootic cycle when humans enter zoonotic foci and/or enzootic amplification increases circulation near humans. Examples include Eastern (EEEV) and Western equine encephalitis viruses (WEEV), as well as West Nile (WNV), St. Louis encephalitis (SLEV) and Yellow fever viruses. Spillover can involve direct transmission to humans by primary enzootic vectors (e.g. WNV, SLEV and WEEV) and/or bridge vectors with more catholic feeding preferences that include humans (e.g. EEEV). Some viruses, such as Rift Valley fever, Japanese encephalitis and Venezuelan equine encephalitis viruses (VEEV) undergo secondary amplification involving replication in livestock animals, resulting in greater levels of spillover to humans in rural settings. In the case of VEEV, secondary amplification involves equines and requires adaptive mutations in enzootic strains that allow for efficient viremia production. Two of the most important human arboviral pathogens, Yellow fever and dengue viruses (DENV), have gone one step further and adopted humans as their amplification hosts, allowing for urban disease. The ancestral forms of DENV, sylvatic viruses transmitted among nonhuman primate reservoir hosts by arboreal mosquitoes, adapted to efficiently infect the urban mosquito vectors Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus during the past few thousand years as civilizations arose. Comparative studies of the sylvatic and urban forms of DENV may elucidate the evolution of arboviral virulence and the prospects for DENV eradication should effective vaccines be implemented.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15540144": "In field experiments manipulating generalist pathogens and host community composition, the presence of a highly susceptible reservoir species drove disease dynamics in multiple nonreservoir species, sometimes decreasing their abundance through apparent competition. The dynamics of generalist pathogens in multispecies host communities remain a major frontier for disease ecology. Of particular interest are how host community structure controls pathogen transmission and how disease spread feeds back to influence the host community. Pathogen spillover occurs when epidemics in a host population are driven not by transmission within that population but by transmission from a reservoir population. Here we review examples of spillover in pathogens infecting humans, domesticated animals, and crops, noting that most empirical evidence for spillover results from nonmanipulative, observational studies. We then present results from two field experiments utilizing an experimentally tractable model system of annual wild grasses and a generalist virus, the barley yellow dwarf virus. In these experiments, the presence of a highly susceptible reservoir species, Avena fatua (wild oats), greatly increased pathogen prevalence in several other species. This result demonstrates pathogen spillover and illustrates the crucial role of host community structure in controlling the dynamics of generalist pathogens. Further, pathogen spillover from A. fatua decreased the abundance of two other host species through pathogen-mediated apparent competition. Thus, our results provide experimental support for theoretical predictions of strong feedbacks between host community structure and generalist disease dynamics.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32427175": "In Africa, bat-borne zoonoses emerged in the past few decades resulting in large outbreaks or just sporadic spillovers. In addition, hundreds of more viruses are described without any information on zoonotic potential. We discuss important characteristics of bats including bat biology, evolution, distribution and ecology that not only make them unique among most mammals but also contribute to their potential as viral reservoirs. The detection of a virus in bats does not imply that spillover will occur and several biological, ecological and anthropogenic factors play a role in such an event. We summarize and critically analyse the current knowledge on African bats as reservoirs for corona-, filo-, paramyxo- and lyssaviruses. We highlight that important information on epidemiology, bat biology and ecology is often not available to make informed decisions on zoonotic spillover potential. Even if knowledge gaps exist, it is still important to recognize the role of bats in zoonotic disease outbreaks and implement mitigation strategies to prevent exposure to infectious agents including working safely with bats. Equally important is the crucial role of bats in various ecosystem services. This necessitates a multidisciplinary One Health approach to close knowledge gaps and ensure the development of responsible mitigation strategies to not only minimize risk of infection but also ensure conservation of the species.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30096035": "The invasive ectoparasite Sarcoptes scabiei affects the welfare and conservation of Australian marsupials. Molecular data suggest that spillover from other hosts may be responsible for the emergence of this infectious disease, but the scale of such studies is limited. We performed expanded molecular typing of the S. scabiei mitochondrial cox1 gene from 81 skin scrapings from infested wombats ( Vombatus ursinus), koalas ( Phascolarctos cinereus), red foxes ( Vulpes vulpes), and dogs ( Canis lupus familiaris) across Australia. Combined with existing S. scabiei sequences, our analysis revealed 16 haplotypes among Australian animals, sharing between 93.3% and 99.7% sequence similarity. While some sequences were unique to specific hosts or to Australia, key haplotypes could be detected across several marsupial hosts as well as to wild or domestic canids in Australia. We identified 43 cox1 haplotypes with many Australian haplotypes identical to S. scabiei mites from inside and outside Europe. We concluded that multiple introduction events were plausible explanations to the origin and emergence of this parasite into Australian marsupials and that disease spillover from canids was likely.

Whole-genome sequences obtained from 77 birds and 8 marine mammals revealed that all Chilean H5N1 viruses belong to lineage 2.3.4.4b and cluster monophyletically with viruses from Peru, indicating a single introduction from North America into Peru/Chile. Mammalian adaptations were identified in the PB2 segment: D701N in two sea lions, one human, and one shorebird, and Q591K in the human and one sea lion. Minor variant analysis revealed that D701N was present in 52.9 - 70.9% of sequence reads, indicating the presence of both genotypes within hosts.

The biological background of pathogen spillover or host switch, however, still has to be clarified. Disease ecology finds pathogen spillovers frequently but struggles to explain at the molecular level. Contrarily, molecular biological traits of host-pathogen relationships with specific molecular binding mechanisms predict few spillovers. Here we aim to provide a synthetic explanation by arguing that domestication, horizontal gene transfer even between superkingdoms as well as gradual exchange of microbiome (microbiome succession) are essential in the whole scenario. We present a new perspective at the molecular level which can explain the observations of frequent pathogen spillover events at the ecological level. This proposed rationale is described in detail, along with supporting evidence from the peer-reviewed literature and suggestions for testing hypothesis validity. We also highlight the importance of systematic monitoring of virulence genes across taxonomical categories and in the whole biosphere as it helps prevent future epidemics and pandemics. We conclude that that the processes of domestication, horizontal gene transfer and microbial succession might be important mechanisms behind the many spillover events driven and accelerated by climate change, biodiversity loss and globalization.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35632729": "Dozens of orthobunyaviruses have been isolated in Brazil, and at least thirteen have been associated with human disease.

The use of animals as human surrogate models or as target-host models in research is an integral part of unraveling the interrelated components involved in these dynamic systems. These models can prove vitally important in determining both viral- and host-factors associated with virus transmission, providing invaluable information that can be developed into better risk mitigation strategies.

Identifying and averting spillover transmission is crucial for preventing outbreaks and mitigating infectious disease burdens. Investigating the processes that lead to spillover fundamentally involves interactions between animals, humans, pathogens and the environments they inhabit. Accordingly, it is recognized that transdisciplinary approaches provide a more holistic understanding of spillover phenomena. To characterize the discourse about spillover within and between disciplines, we conducted a review of review papers about spillover from multiple disciplines. We systematically searched and screened literature from several databases to identify a corpus of review papers from ten academic disciplines. We performed qualitative content analysis on text where authors described either a spillover pathway, or a conceptual gap in spillover theory. Cluster analysis of pathway data identified nine major spillover processes discussed in the review literature. We summarized the main features of each process, how different disciplines contributed to them, and identified specialist and generalist disciplines based on the breadth of processes they studied. Network analyses showed strong similarities between concepts reviewed by 'One Health' disciplines (e.g. Veterinary Science & Animal Health, Public Health & Medicine, Ecology & Evolution, Environmental Science), which had broad conceptual scope and were well-connected to other disciplines. By contrast, awas focused on processes that are relatively overlooked by other disciplines, especially those involving food behaviour and livestock husbandry practices.

Features that distinguish PN skin from the skin of patients with atopic dermatitis were of particular interest. We further aimed to determine the impact of the IL31RA antagonist, nemolizumab, and its specificity at the single-cell level.\nMETHODS: Single-cell RNA-sequencing of skin from 15 healthy donors and nonlesional and lesional skin from 6 patients each with PN and atopic dermatitis, combined with spatial-sequencing using the 10x Visium platform. Integration with bulk RNA-sequencing data from patients treated with nemolizumab.\nRESULTS: This study demonstrates that PN is an inflammatory skin disease characterized by both keratinocyte proliferation and activation of profibrotic responses. This study also demonstrates that the COL11A1+ fibroblast subset is a major contributor to fibrosis and is predominantly found in the papillary dermis of PN skin.

However, relapse after treatment is common in PN, which means that either long-term therapy is necessary or the treatment protocols have to be optimized to minimize side-effects.\nOBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect that combining bath PUVA and targeted UVB 308 nm excimer radiation has on recalcitrant nodular prurigo.\nMETHODS: In a prospective trial, 22 patients with PN were treated with either PUVA alone or with a combination of PUVA and excimer UVB. The end point was complete or almost complete remission of PN.\nRESULTS: Adding a 308-nm excimer UVB to the treatment of the pruritic nodules sped up the healing process; 30% less PUVA radiation was needed.\nCONCLUSION: The combination of PUVA and excimer UVB in PN appears to be very efficacious.

The course of prurigo nodularis is often chronic, and some patients respond very poorly to the standard therapeutic modalities. Because the pathogenesis of this disease remains obscure, the treatment of prurigo nodularis can be disappointing and frustrating for both the patients and physicians. Thalidomide, a tumor necrosis factor-alpha antagonist, has been suggested as an alternative treatment option for recalcitrant prurigo nodularis. In the past, the regimen for treatment of prurigo nodularis often required thalidomide at 200 mg/day. We recruited patients with intractable prurigo nodularis and treated them with low-dose thalidomide. Six patients with idiopathic prurigo nodularis were successfully treated with low-dose thalidomide (50-100 mg/day) without clinical development of peripheral neuropathy. In summary, our preliminary results suggest that low-dose thalidomide may be a safe and effective treatment option for patients with recalcitrant idiopathic prurigo nodularis.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38016088": "Prurigo nodularis (PN) is a chronic inflammatory skin condition characterized by the presence of pruritic nodules.

There was no statistically significant difference in the alpha-diversity (intra-sample diversity) between the PN, AD and HV groups. The beta-diversity (inter-sample diversity) showed statistically significant differences between the three groups on a global level and in paired analyses. Staphylococcus was significantly more abundant in samples from PN and AD patients than in controls. The difference was maintained across all taxonomic levels. The PN microbiome is highly similar to that of AD. It remains unclear whether the disturbed composition of the microbiome and the domination of Staphylococcus in PN lesions may be the trigger factor of pruritus and lead to the development of cutaneous changes or is a secondary phenomenon.

This can contribute to disease through increasing carcinogenic metabolite/toxin production, inducing inflammation, and activating oncogenic signaling. To limit disease progression, external factors that may influence the colonic microbiota need to be considered in patients with colorectal cancer. One major factor that can influence the colonic microbiota is iron. Iron is an essential micronutrient that is required by both prokaryotes and eukaryotes for cellular function. Most pathogenic bacteria have heightened iron acquisition mechanisms and therefore tend to outcompete protective bacteria for free iron. Colorectal cancer patients often present with anemia due to iron deficiency, and thus they require iron therapy. Depending upon the route of administration, iron therapy has the potential to contribute to a procarciongenic microbiota. Orally administered iron is the common treatment for anemia in these patients but can lead to an increased gut iron concentration. This suggests the need to reassess the route of iron therapy in these patients.

Many recent studies have attempted to define links between microbiota residents, their function and the development of colorectal cancer (CRC). Gut microbiota drive the development of inflammation within the colon and such inflammation is implicated in colonic neoplastic development. Although the precise mechanisms through which the microbiota is involved in cancer development remain elusive, the message is clear: the microbiota contributes to cancer risk by influencing a number of key host processes. It is also recognized that we have the ability to influence the role of the gut microbiota by considering our nutritional intake. We have always known that 'we are what we eat' but it is also true that 'they (our gut microbiota) are what we eat'. We therefore have a huge opportunity to positively influence our health through microbial manipulation. There is now a clear need to move past defining the constituents of the gastrointestinal microbiota and to focus more on understanding the functional capabilities of the resident microbial community and how this impacts on host health.

Increasing evidence points to the gut microbiota as the primary initiator of colonic inflammation, which is connected to the development of colonic tumors. However, it is unclear how the microbiota contributes to the development of CRCs.

Recent studies suggest that dysbiosis of the oral microbiota can alter the microbial composition in relative abundance or diversity of the distal gut, leading to the progression of digestive carcinogenesis. The link between PD and specific GI disorders is also closely associated with the migration and colonization of periodontal pathogens and the subsequent microbe-reactive T cell induction within the intestines. In this review, an in-depth examination of this relationship and the accessibility of different mouse models of IBD and PD may shed light on the current dogma. As such, oral microbiota dysbiosis involving specific bacteria, including Fusobacterium nucleatum and Porphyromonas gingivalis, can ultimately lead to gut malignancies.

A diet high in animal protein and fat is an environmental risk factor for CRC development. The intestinal microbiota is postulated to modulate the effects of diet in promoting or preventing CRC. Hydrogen sulfide, produced by autochthonous sulfidogenic bacteria, triggers proinflammatory pathways and hyperproliferation, and is genotoxic. We hypothesised that sulfidogenic bacterial abundance in colonic mucosa may be an environmental CRC risk factor that distinguishes AA and NHW.\nDESIGN: Colonic biopsies from uninvolved or healthy mucosa from CRC cases and tumour-free controls were collected prospectively from five medical centres in Chicago for association studies. Sulfidogenic bacterial abundance in uninvolved colonic mucosa of AA and NHW CRC cases was compared with normal mucosa of AA and NHW controls. In addition, 16S rDNA sequencing was performed in AA cases and controls. Correlations were examined among bacterial targets, race, disease status and dietary intake.\nRESULTS: AAs harboured a greater abundance of sulfidogenic bacteria compared with NHWs regardless of disease status. Bilophila wadsworthia-specific dsrA was more abundant in AA cases than controls. Linear discriminant analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed five sulfidogenic genera that were more abundant in AA cases. Fat and protein intake and daily servings of meat were significantly higher in AAs compared with NHWs, and multiple dietary components correlated with a higher abundance of sulfidogenic bacteria.\nCONCLUSIONS: These results implicate sulfidogenic bacteria as a potential environmental risk factor contributing to CRC development in AAs.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33937029": "Accumulating evidence indicates that breakdown of the+ protective mucosal barrier of the gut plays a role in colorectal cancer (CRC) development. Inflammation and oxidative stress in the colonic epithelium are thought to be involved in colorectal carcinogenesis and the breakdown of the integrity of the colonic barrier may increase the exposure of colonocytes to toxins from the colonic milieu, enhancing inflammatory processes and release of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS). The aetiological importance of the gut microbiome and its composition - influenced by consumption of processed meats, red meats and alcoholic drinks, smoking, physical inactivity, obesity - in CRC development is also increasingly being recognized. The gut microbiome has diverse roles, such as in nutrient metabolism and immune modulation. However, microbial encroachment towards the colonic epithelium may promote inflammation and oxidative stress and even translocation of species across the colonic lumen. Recent research suggests that factors that modify the above mechanisms, e.g., obesity and Western diet, also alter gut microbiota, degrade the integrity of the gut protective barrier, and expose colonocytes to toxins. However, it remains unclear how obesity, lifestyle and metabolic factors contribute to gut-barrier integrity, leading to metabolic disturbance, colonocyte damage, and potentially to CRC development.

The pathogenesis of ethanol-related colorectal cancer (ER-CRC) is thought to be partly mediated by gut microbes. Specifically, bacteria in the colon and rectum convert ethanol to acetaldehyde (AcH), which is carcinogenic. However, the effects of chronic ethanol consumption on the human gut microbiome are poorly understood, and the role of gut microbes in the proposed AcH-mediated pathogenesis of ER-CRC remains to be elaborated. Here we analyse and compare the gut microbiota structures of non-alcoholics and alcoholics. The gut microbiotas of alcoholics were diminished in dominant obligate anaerobes (e.g., Bacteroides and Ruminococcus) and enriched in Streptococcus and other minor species. This alteration might be exacerbated by habitual smoking. These observations could at least partly be explained by the susceptibility of obligate anaerobes to reactive oxygen species, which are increased by chronic exposure of the gut mucosa to ethanol. The AcH productivity from ethanol was much lower in the faeces of alcoholic patients than in faeces of non-alcoholic subjects. The faecal phenotype of the alcoholics could be rationalised based on their gut microbiota structures and the ability of gut bacteria to accumulate AcH from ethanol.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24412617": "Commensal gut microflora and dietary fiber protect against colonic inflammation and colon cancer through unknown targets. Butyrate, a bacterial product from fermentation of dietary fiber in the colon, has been implicated in this process. GPR109A (encoded by Niacr1) is a receptor for butyrate in the colon. GPR109A is also a receptor for niacin, which is also produced by gut microbiota and suppresses intestinal inflammation. Here we showed that Gpr109a signaling promoted anti-inflammatory properties in colonic macrophages and dendritic cells and enabled them to induce differentiation of Treg cells and IL-10-producing T cells. Moreover, Gpr109a was essential for butyrate-mediated induction of IL-18 in colonic epithelium. Consequently, Niacr1(-/-) mice were susceptible to development of colonic inflammation and colon cancer. Niacin, a pharmacological Gpr109a agonist, suppressed colitis and colon cancer in a Gpr109a-dependent manner.

Located at close proximity to the colorectal epithelium, the gut microbiota comprises a large population of microorganisms that interact with host cells to regulate many physiological processes, such as energy harvest, metabolism and immune response. Sequencing studies have revealed microbial compositional and ecological changes in patients with CRC, whereas functional studies in animal models have pinpointed the roles of several bacteria in colorectal carcinogenesis, including Fusobacterium nucleatum and certain strains of Escherichia coli and Bacteroides fragilis. These findings give new opportunities to take advantage of our knowledge on the gut microbiota for clinical applications, such as gut microbiota analysis as screening, prognostic or predictive biomarkers, or modulating microorganisms to prevent cancer, augment therapies and reduce adverse effects of treatment. This Review aims to provide an overview and discussion of the gut microbiota in colorectal neoplasia, including relevant mechanisms in microbiota-related carcinogenesis, the potential of utilizing the microbiota as CRC biomarkers, and the prospect for modulating the microbiota for CRC prevention or treatment. These scientific findings will pave the way to clinically translate the use of gut microbiota for CRC in the near future.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36572998": "DNA methylation is an epigenetic process altered in cancer and ageing. Age-related methylation drift can be used to estimate lifespan and can be influenced by extrinsic factors such as diet. Here, we report that non-pathogenic microbiota accelerate age-related methylation drift in the colon when compared with germ-free mice. DNA methylation analyses showed that microbiota and IL10KO were associated with changes in 5% and 4.1% of CpG sites, while mice with both factors had 18% alterations. Microbiota, IL10KO, and their combination altered 0.4%, 0.4%, and 4% of CpG island methylation, respectively. These are comparable to what is seen in colon cancer. Ageing changes were accelerated in the IL10KO mice with microbiota, and the affected genes were more likely to be altered in colon cancer. Thus, the microbiota affect DNA methylation of the colon in patterns reminiscent of what is observed in ageing and colorectal cancer.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36704106": "BACKGROUND: Colorectal polyps are the most common precursors of colorectal cancer (CRC). The close relationship has been observed between colorectal polyps and gut microbiota. However, gut microbiota signatures among sampling sites in patients with colorectal polyps and healthy adults remain elusive.\nAIMS: To learn about gut microbiota signatures in tissues of the colorectal polyp and normal colorectal mucosa, and faeces.\nMETHODS: We performed 16S rRNA gene sequencing and bioinformatic analysis for the microbiota in the normal colorectal mucosa, the colorectal polyps and faeces of adults with colorectal polyps (n = 24) and in faeces and normal mucosa of healthy adults (n = 16) in this preliminary trial.\nRESULTS: The Ace and Chao indexes were higher in the normal colorectal mucosa and polyp tissues compared to faecal samples (P &lt; 0.05). The composition of microbiota based on PCoA and ANOSIM analysis showed the significant differences only between faeces and tissues of the normal mucosa and polyp (P &lt; 0.05). Based on the LEfSe analysis, the abundances of Bacteroides, Prevotella-2 and Agathobacter were higher, whereas the abundances of Haemophilus, Escherichia_Shigella, Fusobacterium and Streptococcus were lower in faeces both in patients with colorectal polyp and healthy individuals, compared with those in the normal mucosa in two groups or polyp tissues. In healthy individuals, the abundance of Fusobacterium was significantly higher in the normal colorectal mucosa than in faeces. Moreover, there was no significant difference in the abundance of Fusobacterium between the normal colorectal mucosa and polyps in patients with colorectal polyps, but it was significantly higher in the mucosa and polyps than in faeces. Remarkably, the abundance of Fusobacterium in the normal colorectal mucosa was significantly higher in healthy individuals than in the polyp group.\nCONCLUSIONS: The microbial structure in faeces differs from that in tissues of polyp and normal mucusa. Additionally, Fusobacterium may be a normal colonizer in colonic mucosa, and an abnormal increase of Fusobacterium detected in faeces may be related with the injury of the colorectal mucosa. The difference of the faecal microbiota and mucosal microbiota should be carefully considered in studies on gut microbiota in patients with colorectal lesions.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35013389": "GPR120 (encoded by FFAR4 gene) is a receptor for long chain fatty acids, activated by \u03c9-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids (PUFAs), and expressed in many cell types. Its role in the context of colorectal cancer (CRC) is still puzzling with many controversial evidences. Here, we explored the involvement of epithelial GPR120 in the CRC development. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments were conducted to mimic the conditional deletion of the receptor from gut epithelium. Intestinal permeability and integrity of mucus layer were assessed by using Evans blue dye and immunofluorescence for MUC-2 protein, respectively. Microbiota composition, presence of lipid mediators and short chain fatty acids were analyzed in the stools of conditional GPR120 and wild type (WT) mice. Incidence and grade of tumors were evaluated in all groups of mice before and after colitis-associated cancer. Finally, GPR120 expression was analyzed in 9 human normal tissues, 9 adenomas, and 17 primary adenocarcinomas. Our work for the first time highlights the role of the receptor in the progression of colorectal cancer. We observed that the loss of epithelial GPR120 in the gut results into increased intestinal permeability, microbiota translocation and dysbiosis, which turns into hyperproliferation of epithelial cells, likely through the activation of \u03b2 -catenin signaling. Therefore, the loss of GPR120 represents an early event of CRC, but avoid its progression as invasive cancer. these results demonstrate that the epithelial GPR120 receptor is essential to maintain the mucosal barrier integrity and to prevent CRC developing. Therefore, our data pave the way to GPR120 as an useful marker for the phenotypic characterization of CRC lesions and as new potential target for CRC prevention.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33577585": "Chronic ethanol consumption is a risk factor for colorectal cancer, and ethanol-induced reactive oxygen species have been suggested to play important roles in the pathogenesis of ethanol-related colorectal cancer (ER-CRC). In this study, the effects of 10-week chronic administration of ethanol on the colonic levels of oxidative stress and advance glycation end product (AGE) levels, as well as fecal microbiota structures, were examined in a mouse model. Chronic oral administration of ethanol in mice (1.0 mL of 1.5% or 5.0% ethanol (v/v) per day per mouse, up to 10 weeks) resulted in the elevation of colonic levels of oxidative stress markers (such as 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine and 4-hydroxynonenal) compared to control mice, and this was consistently accompanied by elevated levels of inflammation-associated cytokines and immune cells (Th17 and macrophages) and a decreased level of regulatory T (Treg) cells to produce colonic lesions. It also resulted in an alteration of mouse fecal microbiota structures, reminiscent of the alterations observed in human inflammatory bowel disease, and this appeared to be consistent with the proposed sustained generation of oxidative stress in the colonic environment during chronic ethanol consumption. Moreover, the first experimental evidence that chronic ethanol administration results in elevated levels of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and their receptors (RAGE) in the colonic tissues in mice is also shown, implying enhanced RAGE-mediated signaling with chronic ethanol administration. The RAGE-mediated signaling pathway has thus far been implicated as a link between the accumulation of AGEs and the development of many types of chronic colitis and cancers. Thus, enhancement of this pathway likely exacerbates the ethanol-induced inflammatory states of colonic tissues and might at least partly contribute to the pathogenesis of ER-CRC.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31330830": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer death worldwide. It includes different subtypes that differ in their clinical and prognostic features. In the past decade, in addition to the conventional adenoma-carcinoma model, an alternative multistep mechanism of carcinogenesis, namely the \"serrated pathway\", has been described. Approximately, 15 to 30% of all CRCs arise from neoplastic serrated polyps, a heterogeneous group of lesions that are histologically classified into three morphologic categories: hyperplastic polyps, sessile serrated adenomas/polyps, and the traditional serrated adenomas/polyps. Serrated polyps are characterized by genetic (BRAF or KRAS mutations) and epigenetic (CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP)) alterations that cooperate to initiate and drive malignant transformation from normal colon mucosa to polyps, and then to CRC. The high heterogeneity of the serrated lesions renders their diagnostic and pathological interpretation difficult. Hence, novel genetic and epigenetic biomarkers are required for better classification and management of CRCs. To date, several molecular alterations have been associated with the serrated polyp-CRC sequence. In addition, the gut microbiota is emerging as a contributor to/modulator of the serrated pathway. This review summarizes the state of the art of the genetic, epigenetic and microbiota signatures associated with serrated CRCs, together with their clinical implications.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32398370": "The intestinal mucosa exists in dynamic balance with trillions of luminal microbes. Disruption of the intestinal epithelial barrier, commonly observed in mucosal inflammation and diseases such as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), is often associated with dysbiosis, particularly decreases in species producing short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), such as butyrate. It remains unclear to what extent microbiota-derived factors contribute to the overall maintenance of intestinal homeostasis. Initial studies revealed that butyrate selectively promotes epithelial barrier function and wound healing. We aimed to define the specific mechanism(s) through which butyrate contributes to these epithelial responses. Guided by an unbiased profiling approach, we identified the dominant regulation of the actin-binding protein synaptopodin (SYNPO). Extensions of this work revealed a role for SYNPO in intestinal epithelial barrier function and wound healing. SYNPO was localized to the intestinal epithelial tight junction and within F-actin stress fibers where it is critical for barrier integrity and cell motility. Butyrate, but not other SCFAs, induced SYNPO in epithelial cell lines and murine colonic enteroids through mechanisms possibly involving histone deacetylase inhibition. Moreover, depletion of the microbiota abrogated expression of SYNPO in the mouse colon, which was rescued with butyrate repletion. Studies in Synpo-deficient mice demonstrated exacerbated disease susceptibility and increased intestinal permeability in a dextran sulfate sodium colitis model. These findings establish a critical role for the microbiota and their products, specifically butyrate, in the regulated expression of SYNPO for intestinal homeostasis and reveal a direct mechanistic link between microbiota-derived butyrate and barrier restoration.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31027304": "The colonic epithelium is exposed to a mixture of compounds through diet, among which some are procarcinogens, whereas others have a protective effect. Therefore, the net impact of these compounds on human health depends on the overall balance between all factors involved. Strong scientific evidence has demonstrated the relationship between nitrosamines (NA), heterocyclic amines (HCAs), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which are the major genotoxins derived from cooking and food processing, and cancer. The mechanisms of the relationship between dietary toxic xenobiotics and cancer risk are not yet well understood, but it has been suggested that differences in dietary habits affect the colonic environment by increasing or decreasing the exposure to mutagens directly and indirectly through changes in the composition and activity of the gut microbiota. Several changes in the proportions of specific microbial groups have been proposed as risk factors for the development of neoplastic lesions and the enrichment of enterotoxigenic microbial strains in stool. In addition, changes in the gut microbiota composition and activity promoted by diet may modify the faecal genotoxicity/cytotoxicity, which can be associated with a higher or lower risk of developing cancer.

Genetic backgrounds, lifestyle, and diet play an important role in CRC risk. The human gut microbiota has an influence on many features of human physiology such as metabolism, nutrient absorption, and immune function. Imbalance of the microbiota has been implicated in many disorders including CRC. It seems Warburg effect hypothesis corresponds to the early beginning of carcinogenesis because of eventual failure in the synthesis of a pyruvate dehydrogenase complex in cooperation with a supply of glucose in carbohydrates rich diets. From investigation among previous publications, we attempted to make it clear importance of Warburg effect in tumors; it also discusses the mechanisms of probiotics in inhibiting tumor progression and reverse Warburg effect of probiotics in modulating the microbiota and CRC therapies. These effects were observed in some clinical trials, the application of probiotics as a therapeutic agent against CRC still requirements further investigation.\nCONCLUSION: Fiber is fermented by colonic bacteria into SCFAs such as butyrate/acetate, which may play a vital role in normal homeostasis by promoting turnover of the colonic epithelium. Butyrate enters the nucleus and functions as a histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi). Because cancerous colonocytes undertake the Warburg effect pathway, their favored energy source is glucose instead of butyrate. Therefore, accumulation of moderate concentrations of butyrate in cancerous colonocytes and role as HDACi.

However, identifying the molecular mechanisms for how aneuploidy and chromosomal instability (CIN) arise in sporadic and colitis-associated CRC has been difficult. In this Addendum we review recent work from our laboratory that explore mechanisms by which intestinal commensals polarize colon macrophages to an M1 phenotype to generate a bystander effect (BSE) that leads to mutations, spindle malfunction, cell cycle arrest, tetraploidy, and aneuploidy in epithelial cells. BSE represents the application of a phenomenon initially described in the radiation biology field. The result of commensal-driven BSE on colon epithelial cells is aneuploidy, chromosomal instability (CIN), expression of stem cell and tumor stem cell markers and, ultimately, malignant transformation.

The digesta leaving the ileum on high-fat, high-protein, low-fiber diets has a high proportion of mucins, malabsorbed carbohydrates and proteins, bile acids, and sloughed epithelial cells. The irregular (pulsatile) emptying of rapidly fermentable ileal digesta into the colon causes a massive surge in microbial activity. The sudden availability of rapidly fermentable substrate generates a large microbial population in the exponential growth phase that soon depletes its substrate. For microorganisms to perpetuate until the next high-fat, high-protein, low-fiber meal propels ileal digesta into the colon, they must induce enzymes to ferment dying or dead microbes (cannibalism) in addition to colonic epithelial mucosa and mucins. As the carbohydrate-to-nitrogen ratio of the colonic contents decreases, the fermentation becomes more proteolytic and subacute levels of fermentation products such as ammonia may be generated. Carcinogens are concentrated within a small colonic mass and the probability of precancerous lesions and polyps developing in the colonic mucosa is directly related to the severity, frequency, and duration of these microbial \"feast or famine\" situations in the colon.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32991312": "Gut-brain axis plays a central role in the regulation of stress related diseases such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). It is increasingly recognized that stress modulates gut microbiota community structure and activity and represents an important causal factor in dysbiosis.

Control rats received daily treatment with vehicle (saline, i.g.) or mesalazine (50 mg/kg-d i.g.), the standard drug recommended in therapy of IBD. At the termination of TNBS colitis, the histologic evaluation of colonic mucosa, mucosal malonyldialdehyde (MDA) level and plasma concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2) and adipokine adiponectin were assessed. the samples of colonic mucosa not involving colonic lesions and surrounding the flared mucosa were excised for the determination of mRNA expression for proinflammatory biomarkers TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-10 and COX-2 as well as antioxidazing factors SOD-1 and SOD-2. Finally, the gut microbial profiles were analyzed by 16S rRNA sequencing at phylum, family and genus level. Episodes of cold stress significantly aggravated the course of TNBS colitis, and significantly increased the release of proinflammatory cytokines as well as the significant increase in the MDA concentration has been observed as compared with non-stressed TNBS rats. These changes were followed by the significant fall in the CBF and plasma adiponectin levels and by the overexpression of mRNA of proinflammatory biomarkers. Synbiotic treatment with Syngut significantly reduced the area of colonic lesions observed macroscopically and microscopically in rats with TNBS colitis with or without exposure to cold stress, significantly increased the CBF, normalized plasma adiponectin levels and significantly attenuated the release and colonic expression of proinflammatory cytokines and biomarkers. the analysis of the gut microbiota showed a significant reduction of microbial diversity (Shannon index) in rats with TNBS colitis with or without exposure to stress. The therapy with Syngut failed to significantly affect the alpha diversity. At the phylum level, the significant rise in Proteobacteria has been observed in stressed rats with TNBS colitis and this effects was attenuated by treatment with Syngut. At family level, TNBS colitis alone or in combination with stress led to a significant decrease of SCFA producing bacterial taxa such as Ruminococaceae and Lachnospiraceae and Syngut counteracted this effect. We conclude that: 1) cold stress exacerbates the gastrointestinal inflammation in experimental colitis; 2) the synbiotic therapy with Syngut ameliorates the gut inflammation in rats with TNBS colitis combined with cold stress; 3) the beneficial effect of Syngut is accompanied by increase of anti-inflammatory taxa such as Ruminococaceae and Lachnospiraceae, and 4) the modulation of gut microbiota with Syngut alleviates stress-related intestinal inflammation suggesting a potential usefulness of synbiotic therapy in intestinal disorders accompanied by stress in patients with IBD.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22868282": "Recent advances in our ability to identify and characterize the human microbiota have transformed our appreciation of the function of the colon from an organ principally involved in the reabsorption of secretory fluids to a metabolic organ on a par with the liver. High-throughput technology has been applied to the identification of specific differences in microbial DNA, allowing the identification of trillions of microbes belonging to more than 1000 different species, with a metabolic mass of approximately 1.5 kg. The close proximity of these microbes with the mucosa and gut lymphoid tissue helps explain why a balanced microbiota is likely to preserve mucosal health, whereas an unbalanced composition, as seen in dysbiosis, may increase the prevalence of diseases not only of the mucosa but also within the body due to the strong interactions with the gut immune system, the largest immune organ of the body. Such abnormalities have been pinpointed as etiological factors in a wide range of diseases, including autoimmune disorders, allergy, irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, obesity, and colon cancer.

Although it is conventional to emphasise differences between IBD-associated and sporadic colon cancer, such as a lower rate of Adenomatosis Polyposis Coli mutations and earlier p53 mutations, IBD-associated cancer has a similar dysplasia-cancer sequence to sporadic colon cancer, similar frequencies of major chromosomal abnormalities and of microsatellite instability and similar glycosylation changes. This suggests that IBD-associated colon cancer and sporadic colon cancer might have similar pathogenic mechanisms. Because the normal colon is arguably in a continual state of low-grade inflammation in response to its microbial flora, it is reasonable to suggest that both IBD-associated and sporadic colon cancer may be the consequence of bacteria-induced inflammation. We have speculated that the glycosylation changes might result in recruitment to the mucosa of bacterial and dietary lectins that might otherwise pass harmlessly though the gut lumen. These could then lead to increased inflammation and/or proliferation and thence to ulceration or cancer. The glycosylation changes include increased expression of onco-fetal carbohydrates, such as the galactose-terminated Thomsen-Friedenreich antigen (Gal beta1,3GalNAc alpha-), increased sialylation of terminal structures and reduced sulphation. These changes cannot readily be explained by alterations in glycosyltransferase activity but similar changes can be induced in vitro by alkalinisation of the Golgi lumen.

Patients with IBD had a higher risk of developing colorectal carcinoma (CRC), of which the subset was classified as colitis-associated cancers. Genetic polymorphism of innate immune receptors had long been considered a major risk factor for IBD, and the mutations were also recently observed in CRC. Altered microbial composition (termed microbiota dybiosis) and dysfunctional gut barrier manifested by epithelial hyperpermeability and high amount of mucosa-associated bacteria were observed in IBD and CRC patients. The findings suggested that aberrant immune responses to penetrating commensal microbes may play key roles in fueling disease progression. Accumulative evidence demonstrated that mucosa-associated bacteria harbored colitogenic and protumoral properties in experimental models, supporting an active role of bacteria as pathobionts (commensal-derived opportunistic pathogens). Nevertheless, the host factors involved in bacterial dysbiosis and conversion mechanisms from lumen-dwelling commensals to mucosal pathobionts remain unclear. Based on the observation of gut leakiness in patients and the evidence of epithelial hyperpermeability prior to the onset of mucosal histopathology in colitic animals, it was postulated that the epithelial barrier dysfunction associated with mucosal enrichment of specific bacterial strains may predispose the shift to disease-associated microbiota. The speculation of leaky gut as an initiating factor for microbiota dysbiosis that eventually led to pathological consequences was proposed as the \"common ground hypothesis\", which will be highlighted in this review.

The prevalence of adenomas and carcinomas is most prominent in the duodenum and proximal jejunum. The positive correlation in global incidence rates of small and large intestinal neoplasms and the reciprocal increases in risk of second primary adenocarcinomas suggest that there are common environmental risk factors.

It is characterized by a variety of nonspecific clinical, radiological, and histopathological features requiring differential diagnosis from a variety of diseases. Here, we aimed to use our own clinical case as an example of the difficulties in the diagnosis of this disease.\nCASE PRESENTATION: A 14-year-old boy presented with focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures. Brain MRI showed diffuse cortical surface and subcortical lesions, isointense on T1-weighted images and hypointense on T2-weighted images, respectively, with diffuse leptomeningeal gadolinium enhancement. Cytology of the cerebrospinal fluid revealed atypical mononuclear cells, but characteristic melanoma cells were not found. Although we suspected meningeal carcinomatosis, we did not perform abrainbiopsy under the tentative diagnosis of Sturge-Weber syndrome. A definitive diagnosis of primary diffuse leptomeningeal melanomatosis was made with abrainbiopsy after hedevelopednon-convulsive status epilepticus. Despite treatment, he died of hydrocephalus 1\u00a0year and 8\u00a0months after onset.\nCONCLUSION: Primary diffuse leptomeningeal melanomatosis poses a clinical diagnostic and therapeutic challenge.

Histologically, atypical melanocytic cells were also observed.\nDIAGNOSIS: Immunohistochemistry showed positivity for S100 protein, NKiC3, and vimentin, and negativity for Melan-A and HMB-45, with a proliferation index of 30%. Extracranial disease was excluded using dermatological and other examinations, including positron emission tomography/computed tomography with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose.\nINTERVENTIONS: The patient was treated with whole-brain radiotherapy (10 fractions to a total dose of 30\u200aGy) concomitantly with pembrolizumab and then continued with immunotherapy until disease progression with a maximum effect of partial remission on magnetic resonance imaging scans.\nOUTCOMES: Progression-free survival was 6.0\u200amonths and overall survival 6.5\u200amonths.\nLESSONS: This is one of the few case reports of an adult patient with this rare malignancy being treated with a programmed death-1 inhibitor with partial response.

In addition, we performed a comprehensive review of the literature to describe all previously reported cases of PDLM.\nRESULTS: In the reported case, making the diagnosis of PDLM was difficult. A brain and frontal dural biopsy was nondiagnostic. Computed tomography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis did not show any distinct solitary mass. After a positron emission tomography scan was performed that showed lumbar sacral enhancement, lumbar dorsal rootlet biopsy was initiated, which was diagnostic of PDLM. Our literature review found 32 previously reported cases of PDLM. Sixteen cases (48.5%) had a distinct focus or mass discovered on imaging workup. The reported case was the seventeenth reported case of PDLM without a distinct focus or mass found on imaging workup.\nCONCLUSIONS: PDLM is an extremely rare disease, and diagnosis is difficult because of nonspecific clinical, radiographic, and laboratory findings. In approximately half of cases, no distinct mass is shown on imaging workup, which may further complicate diagnosis. PDLM should be on the differential diagnosis for cases of diffuse dural enhancement.

FGF21 is a naturally occurring peptide hormone primarily produced by the liver, with a half-life of 0.5 to 2 hours. It can influence metabolic processes through endocrine cellular effects. FGF21 receptors are found in the liver, adipose, skeletal muscles, and pancreatic tissues. Those receptors rely on the beta klotho (KLB) coreceptors, a transmembrane protein, to activate the FGF21 signaling pathway and FGF21's associated transcription factors. PGZ, through its extended half-life of 55 to 100 hours, has evidenced significant improvements in metabolic functions. Its mechanism of action includes promoting adiponectin levels, enhancing insulin sensitivity, increasing triglyceride uptake, and reducing de novo lipogenesis. This emerging pharmaceutical compound has shown promise in treating liver fibrosis and inflammation linked to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. The ENTRIGUE trial, a phase 2 clinical trial of PGZ, has demonstrated a 57% reduction in triglyceride level compared to placebo; a 45% reduction in liver hepatic steatosis; improved insulin sensitivity; reductions in nonhigh-density lipoprotein-cholesterol; and reductions in apolipoprotein B-100.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37718721": "BACKGROUND: An approved therapy for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and fibrosis remains a major unmet medical need.\nAIM: To investigate the histological and metabolic benefits of pegozafermin, a glycoPEGylated FGF21 analogue, in subjects with biopsy-confirmed NASH.\nMETHODS: This proof-of-concept, open-label, single-cohort study, part 2 of a phase 1b/2a clinical trial, was conducted at 16 centres in the United States.

DP associated with silica nanoparticles (SiNPs) 0.0001\u00a0+\u00a01.1, 0.0002\u00a0+\u00a02.2 and 0.0004\u00a0+\u00a04.4\u00a0mg/mL; 3. SiNPs 1.1, 2.2 and 4.4\u00a0mg/mL and 4. Control (E3), with four repetitions per group. Survival, teratogen and heart rate (HR) were evaluated over a period of 168 hpf. Survival was higher in DP\u00a0+\u00a0SiNPs treatment, HR was lower in treatment with 4.4\u00a0mg/mL of SiNPs, while treatment with 0.004\u00a0mg/mL of DP increased HR. This study demonstrated that the association of DP and SiNPs decreased the toxicity of both DP and SiNPs, demonstrating that this may be a viable alternative to reduce the possible cardiotoxic effects of DP.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24147629": "INTRODUCTION: Domperidone is a dopamine D2-receptor antagonist developed as an antiemetic and prokinetic agent. Oral domperidone is not approved in the United States, but it is used in many countries to treat nausea and vomiting, gastroparesis and as a galactogogue (to promote lactation). The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have issued a warning about the cardiac safety of domperidone.\nAREAS COVERED: The authors undertook a review of the cardiac safety of oral domperidone.\nEXPERT OPINION: The data from preclinical studies are unambiguous in identifying domperidone as able to produce marked hERG channel inhibition and action potential prolongation at clinically relevant concentrations. The compound's propensity to augment instability of action potential duration and action potential triangulation are also indicative of proarrhythmic potential. Domperidone should not be administered to subjects with pre-existing QT prolongation/LQTS, subjects receiving drugs that inhibit CYP3A4, subjects with electrolyte abnormalities or with other risk factors for QT-prolongation. With these provisos, it is possible that domperidone may be used as a galactogogue without direct risk to healthy breast feeding women, but more safety information should be sought in this situation. Also, more safety information is required regarding risk to breast feeding infants before domperidone is routinely used in gastroparesis or gastroesphageal reflux in children.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3527396": "Domperidone is a dopamine antagonist that has recently been released in Canada. Unlike metoclopramide hydrochloride, the other available dopamine antagonist, it does not readily enter the central nervous system. Domperidone acts as both an antiemetic and an upper gastrointestinal tract prokinetic agent. It is rapidly absorbed after oral administration, and few side effects have been reported. Domperidone has been approved for use in Canada for the symptomatic management of upper gastrointestinal tract motility disorders and to prevent gastrointestinal symptoms associated with the use of dopamine agonist agents in Parkinson's disease. The pharmacologic features, indications and side effects of domperidone are reviewed.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4061095": "The effects of domperidone, a peripheral dopamine receptor blocker which poorly crosses the blood-brain barrier, on copulatory and exploratory behaviour were studied in apomorphine (oestrogen + progesterone) treated ovariectomized rats. The dose of domperidone (1.0 mg/kg) which clearly prevented the inhibitory action of apomorphine on the lordotic response did not influence the effect of apomorphine in an exploratory test situation. This finding indicates that peripherally (intraperitoneally) administered domperidone influences dopaminergic mechanisms implicated in the copulatory behaviour of the female rat, but not dopaminergic mechanisms involved in exploratory behaviour. The possibility that domperidone reaches the brain region responsible for the lordotic behaviour, e.g. the hypothalamus, is discussed.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4087563": "UNLABELLED: Domperidone (dopamine antagonist), metoclopramide and clebopride (both dopamine antagonists and stimulators of the intramural cholinergic system), and trimebutine (spasmolytic) are used in the treatment of digestive disorders such as dyspepsia or gastritis. Our aim was to compare the effects of these compounds on the isolated intact gastroduodenal preparation of the guinea pig. Domperidone (IC50 = 10(-6) M), clebopride (10(-5) M) and metoclopramide (2 X 10(-5) M) antagonized gastric relaxations induced by dopamine. In contrast with clebopride, domperidone and metoclopramide enhanced the amplitude of gastric contractions, moderately reduced contractile frequency, and enhanced antroduodenal coordination in a dose-dependent manner (EC50 for domperidone 3 X 10(-7) M, for metoclopramide 2 X 10(-5) M). Trimebutine reduced gastric spontaneous activity and antroduodenal coordination. Trimebutine had a direct relaxatory effect on gastric tone (EC50 = 4 X 10(-6) M). The mechanism of this inhibitory effect remains unknown but our data indicate that it is not mediated via dopamine or opiate receptor subtypes.\nCONCLUSION: domperidone, clebopride, metoclopramide and trimebutine exert distinct and diverse effects on the motility parameters of the gastroduodenal preparation of the guinea pig. These diverging actions may help explain the differences in patients' responsiveness to the treatment of digestive disorders such as dyspepsia or gastritis.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3048796": "Administration of a dopamine (DA) antagonist, domperidone, increased circulating levels of LH in hyperprolactinaemic-amenorrhoeic women with pituitary microadenomas but not in normal women in the early follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. This drug does not readily cross the blood-brain barrier and therefore the site of action of domperidone could be the pituitary gland or the median eminence. As the simultaneous administration of GnRH and domperidone did not increase the GnRH-induced LH release in hyperprolactinaemic women, the site of action of domperidone is likely to be the median eminence.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21894796": "OBJECTIVE: Domperidone is a dopamine antagonist with anti-nausea and anti-emetic activity. There have been several reports of sudden cardiac death (SCD) associated with the compound. Recently it was estimated to increase SCD nearly fourfold. I therefore tested domperidone for liability of cardiac repolarization disturbances (triangulation, reverse use dependence, instability and dispersion or TRIaD) and induction of arrhythmias.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: In Langendorff perfused rabbit hearts, domperidone significantly prolonged the action potential duration starting at 30 nM. It induced proarrhythmic TRIaD from 100 nM on. Since therapeutic free drug concentrations extend to 19 nM, the safety ratio for domperidone equals 100/19 = 5.25, i.e., far below the minimum safety ratio of 30. Hence, widespread use of domperidone cannot be without danger; especially since it is frequently used as an over the counter medication.\nCONCLUSION: In light of these new preclinical and of recent clinical warnings, domperidone should best be restricted to patients in whom its benefit is proven to justify the risks. Availability without prescription and advertising as an 'innocent' relief is incorrect and unsafe, and needs to be reconsidered.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6756878": "Domperidone is a dopamine antagonist that does not readily enter the central nervous system. Given parenterally or orally it increases gastric emptying of liquids and increases lower oesophageal sphincter pressure in healthy subjects. The antiemetic and pharmacodynamic profile of domperidone is similar to that of metoclopramide, although domperidone has a lower propensity to cause extrapyramidal side effects. Domperidone effectively alleviates symptoms of chronic postprandial dyspepsia and nausea and vomiting due to a wide variety of underlying causes and in some studies has been superior to metoclopramide. Vomiting associated with the administration of moderately emetic cytotoxic drugs is controlled in the majority of patients. Alleviation of the dose-limiting peripheral side effects (nausea and vomiting) of the anti-Parkinsonian drugs bromocriptine and levodopa, enables a higher optimum dose, with consequent improvement in Parkinsonian symptoms. Domperidone does not aggravate the extrapyramidal side effects of neuroleptic drugs. Control of cytotoxic-induced, and postprandial nausea and vomiting in children has been achieved with domperidone without evidence of extrapyramidal side effects.

Domperidone, a peripheral dopamine receptor antagonist, has been successfully used for decades in the US and marketed in many countries for the treatment of gastroparesis. Its use, however, has recently become controversial owing to safety concerns, and it has never been approved for marketing by the FDA. During the 1990s, domperidone was available to US gastroenterologists under a compassionate-use program by Janssen Pharmaceutica, as the manufacturer worked towards, and fell short of, full US market approval. Medical studies, trials and case reports demonstrate the superior efficacy of domperidone when compared with placebo and other pharmaceutical therapies available.

They are differentiated from their pharmacological mode of action, their clinical efficacy and tolerability. Metroclopramide is an antidopaminergic benzamide with mainly antiemetic effects and minor prokinetic efficacy in the GI-Tract. Domperidon is a pure dopaminantagonist. It accelerates gastric emptying but has less effect on bowel motility. Cisapride stimulates indirect the secretion of acetylcholine and acts via 5 HT-receptors selective at the plexus myentericus. These pharmacological differences have clinical relevance: metoclopramide and domperidon could not consistently prove efficacy in functional dyspepsia and GORD. In addition the data in other indications are rare. Only cisapride has shown significant responder rates in controlled studies in the treatment of gastrointestinal motility disorders particularly in long term treatment. As concerns tolerability cisapride presents a progress by its selective mode of action in contrast to the agents crossing the blood-brain-barrier.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2960110": "Specific binding of 3H-domperidone was detected in a homogenate of human caudate nucleus tissue obtained from mentally healthy people and schizophrenic patients postmortem.

The rationale for these experiments was to compare BRO- and DOMP-effects on plasma, brain, and intestinal cholinesterase activity in vitro. BRO and DOMP effects on cholinesterase activity in plasma, striatum, duodenum and ileum of adult male rats were measured for drug concentrations ranging from 0.006 to 3.134 microM for BRO and from 0.006 to 125 microM for DOMP. The results demonstrate that both BRO and DOMP can inhibit cholinesterase activity in all tissues studied, with DOMP being more potent than BRO in plasma and intestinal tissues.

Serendipity is a recurrent theme in discovery of their anti-emetic properties and repurposing from one indication to another is a continuing trend. Notably, the discoveries have occurred against a background of company mergers and changing anti-emetic requirements. Major drug classes include: (i) Muscarinic receptor antagonists-originated from historical accounts of plant extracts containing atropine and hyoscine with development stimulated by the need to prevent sea-sickness among soldiers during beach landings; (ii) Histamine receptor antagonists-searching for replacements for the anti-malaria drug quinine, in short supply because of wartime shipping blockade, facilitated the discovery of histamine (H<sub>1</sub>) antagonists (e.g., dimenhydrinate), followed by serendipitous discovery of anti-emetic activity against motion sickness in a patient undergoing treatment for urticaria; (iii) Phenothiazines and dopamine receptor antagonists-investigations of their pharmacology as \"sedatives\" (e.g., chlorpromazine) implicated dopamine receptors in emesis, leading to development of selective dopamine (D<sub>2</sub>) receptor antagonists (e.g., domperidone with poor ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier) as anti-emetics in chemotherapy and surgery; (iv) Metoclopramide and selective 5-hydroxytryptamine<sub>3</sub>(5-HT<sub>3</sub>) receptor antagonists-metoclopramide was initially assumed to act only via D<sub>2</sub> receptor antagonism but subsequently its gastric motility stimulant effect (proposed to contribute to the anti-emetic action) was shown to be due to 5-hydroxytryptamine<sub>4</sub> receptor agonism. Pre-clinical studies showed that anti-emetic efficacy against the newly-introduced, highly emetic, chemotherapeutic agent cisplatin was due to antagonism at 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptors. The latter led to identification of selective 5-HT<sub>3</sub> receptor antagonists (e.g., granisetron), a major breakthrough in treatment of chemotherapy-induced emesis; (v) Neurokinin<sub>1</sub>receptor antagonists-antagonists of the actions of substance P were developed as analgesics but pre-clinical studies identified broad-spectrum anti-emetic effects; clinical studies showed particular efficacy in the delayed phase of chemotherapy-induced emesis. Finally, the repurposing of different drugs for treatment of nausea and vomiting is examined, particularly during palliative care, and also the challenges in identifying novel anti-emetic drugs, particularly for treatment of nausea as compared to vomiting. We consider the lessons from the past for the future and ask why there has not been a major breakthrough in the last 20 years.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9876882": "This article reviews the pathophysiology and pharmacology of emesis in relation to migraine pathogenesis. Also, the place of antiemetic and gastrointestinal prokinetic agents in current and future acute migraine treatment strategies is reviewed. The mechanisms of action of current and novel acute migraine therapies are considered with respect to the neurogenic and vascular hypothesis. Control of migraine-associated nausea and vomiting is often achieved with the benzamide dopamine D2 receptor antagonist metoclopramide. This drug also has 5HT3 receptor antagonist activity and reproducibly stimulates gastric motility to increase the availability of orally administered drugs. Other antiemetic and gastroprokinetic agents with potential value for the treatment of migraine-associated nausea and vomiting could speed absorption of oral antimigraine therapies without central nervous system side effects. Domperidone, a dopamine D2 receptor antagonist that does not cross the blood brain barrier is relatively free of the central side-effect liability of metoclopramide. Cisapride, a benzamide 5HT4 receptor agonist gastrointestinal prokinetic drug, lacks dopamine antagonist activity. A controlled comparison of these agents as migraine co-therapies could provide information on the importance of peripheral and central mechanisms in migraine-associated nausea and vomiting and improve antimigraine treatment options.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3949445": "The effect of domperidone, a peripheral dopamine receptor antagonist, has been studied in the aspirin, phenylbutazone and reserpine induced gastric ulcers in rats. The gastric anti-ulcer activity of domperidone was evident following a single dose as well as a 5-day pretreatment against all the three ulcerogenic drugs. However, the protection in the five-day pretreatment group was greater than in the single dose pretreatment group. It appears that the gastrokinetic properties of domperidone play a significant role in producing this anti-ulcer effect. The study substantiates the results of the clinical observations on the healing of gastric ulcers and provides a rationale for further clinical studies in that direction. The possible mechanisms of action of this agent are discussed.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6396519": "Field stimulation (0.125-10 Hz) of longitudinal smooth muscle strips taken from the fundus of guinea pig stomach caused frequency related contraction responses (atropine-sensitive) associated with relaxation at the higher frequencies (both responses tetrodotoxin-sensitive). Dopamine, noradrenaline, adrenaline and apomorphine antagonised the contraction responses at all frequencies; the concentration-response curves were steep and the use of higher concentrations was precluded by changes in base line tension per se. That noradrenaline was approximately 10 fold more potent than dopamine, that the dopamine response was not antagonised by the dopamine antagonists haloperidol, domperidone or (-)sulpiride, but was mimicked by the alpha 2-agonist guanfacine and partially antagonised by the alpha 2-adrenoceptor antagonist yohimbine (which could also antagonise the inhibitory actions of guanfacine) would indicate that a component of dopamine's action to reduce cholinergic activity is effected via alpha 2-adrenoceptor mechanisms. A failure of phenylephrine to mimic, or prazosin to attenuate the agonist inhibitory responses would not indicate an additional alpha 1-adrenoceptor involvement. The persistence of the dopamine response following disruption of noradrenergic function by reserpine or inhibition of catecholamine reuptake processes (desmethylimipramine plus corticosterone, GBR 13098) would indicate a direct action of dopamine. It is concluded that the ability of dopamine to reduce cholinergic induced contractions in longitudinal smooth muscle of the stomach does not reflect a dopamine receptor or alpha 1-adrenoceptor stimulation but may involve an action on alpha 2-adrenoceptors.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1851838": "The mechanism of action of clebopride on the motility of guinea pig stomach was examined by the receptor binding assay for bovine brain membrane and by measuring gastric contractility and the release of acetylcholine from the stomach. The receptor binding assay revealed that clebopride bound to the D2 dopamine receptor with a high affinity and to the alpha-2 adrenoceptor and 5-HT2 serotonin receptor with relatively lower affinity, and not to D1 dopamine, alpha-1 adrenergic, muscarinic acetylcholine, H1 histamine, or opioid receptor. In strips of the stomach, clebopride at 10(-8) M to 10(-5) M enhanced the electrical transmural stimulation-evoked contraction and the release of acetylcholine. This enhancement was attributed to the blockade of the D2 dopamine receptor and alpha-2 adrenoceptor because: 1) Maximum responses obtained with specific D2 dopamine receptor antagonist, domperidone, and with specific alpha-2 adrenoceptor antagonist, yohimbine, were smaller than that with clebopride, and the sum of the effects of these two specific receptor antagonists is approximately equal to the effect of clebopride. 2) The facilitatory effect of clebopride was partially eliminated by pretreatment of the sample with domperidone or yohimbine, and the facilitatory effect of clebopride was not observed in preparations treated with the combination of domperidone and yohimbine. Clebopride also antagonized the inhibitory effects of dopamine and clonidine on the electrical transmural stimulation-evoked responses.

Persistent infection with oncogenic HPV types can cause cervical cancer in women as well as other anogenital and oropharyngeal cancers in women and men. HPV also causes genital warts. Two HPV vaccines are licensed in the United States. Both are composed of type-specific HPV L1 protein, the major capsid protein of HPV. Expression of the L1 protein using recombinant DNA technology produces noninfectious virus-like particles (VLPs). Quadrivalent HPV vaccine (HPV4) contains four HPV type-specific VLPs prepared from the L1 proteins of HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18. Bivalent HPV vaccine (HPV2) contains two HPV type-specific VLPs prepared from the L1 proteins of HPV 16 and 18. Both vaccines are administered in a 3-dose series. ACIP recommends routine vaccination with HPV4 or HPV2 for females aged 11 or 12 years and with HPV4 for males aged 11 or 12 years. Vaccination also is recommended for females aged 13 through 26 years and for males aged 13 through 21 years who were not vaccinated previously. Males aged 22 through 26 years may be vaccinated. ACIP recommends vaccination of men who have sex with men and immunocompromised persons (including those with HIV infection) through age 26 years if not previously vaccinated. As a compendium of all current recommendations for use of HPV vaccines, information in this report is intended for use by clinicians, vaccination providers, public health officials, and immunization program personnel as a resource.

In the absence of vaccination, it is estimated that 75% of sexually active Canadians will have a sexually transmitted HPV infection at some point in their lives. Canada's National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) has recommended a three-dose immunization schedule with HPV vaccine for females 9 years of age and older and for males between 9 and 26 years of age, since 2007 and 2012, respectively.\nOBJECTIVE: To outline the evidence on a two-dose HPV vaccine schedule and to make recommendations for the optimal HPV immunization schedule in Canada.\nMETHODS: NACI reviewed the evidence used by the World Health Organization's (WHO's) Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization for the two-dose HPV immunization schedule recommended for immunocompetent girls 9 to 14 years of age and conducted an additional review of literature for studies not included in, or published after, the SAGE review. A knowledge synthesis was performed then NACI approved specific recommendations and elucidated the rationale and relevant considerations.\nRESULTS: Based on the evidence available to date, a two-dose HPV immunization schedule among immunocompetent 9- to 14-year-olds is expected to provide similar protective efficacy compared to a three-dose schedule in immunocompetent individuals aged 9 to 26 years. While all studies reviewed included only females, there is no reason to believe that the data would be different in males, given that data from three-dose trials demonstrates similar immune responses. Administration of two doses of HPV vaccine rather than three may increase acceptability by students, parents and health care professionals alike, and may lead to improved HPV immunization coverage and efficiencies by public health agencies. The duration of protection of either two doses or three doses of HPV vaccine is not yet known; research is encouraged to determine whether there is need for a booster dose.\nCONCLUSION: Based on the evidence available to date, a two-dose HPV immunization schedule (given at least six months apart) among immunocompetent 9- to 14-year-olds may be considered by individuals and jurisdictions to allow for potential cost savings and other individual and programmatic advantages. A three-dose schedule should be used in individuals 15 years of age and older, as well as immunocompromised individuals and immunocompetent HIV-infected individuals.

Descriptive statistics compared consistency and strength of HPV recommendations across age groups. Multivariable logistic regression examined factors associated with consistent and strong recommendations for 11- to 12-year-olds.\nRESULTS: We received 367 completed surveys (51% response rate). Physicians most often consistently and strongly recommended HPV vaccine to males ages 13 to 17 (39%) compared with ages 11 to 12 (31%) and 18 to 21 (31%). Consistent and strong recommendation for 11- to 12-year-old males was more likely to be delivered by Vaccine for Children providers and less likely among physicians who reported more personal barriers to vaccination, particularly concerns about vaccine safety, concerns about adding vaccines to the vaccine schedule, and difficulty in remembering to discuss HPV vaccination.\nCONCLUSIONS: Physicians' current consistency and strength of HPV vaccine recommendations do not align with national recommendations. Interventions to improve HPV vaccine recommendations must also consider the influence of physicians' personal barriers to HPV vaccine delivery.\nIMPACT: As one of the first studies to examine both consistency and strength of physicians' HPV vaccine recommendations for males, our findings can inform future interventions focused on facilitating physicians' recommendations.

This study assessed whether informing men about the benefits of male HPV vaccination for their female sexual partner(s) boosted interest in the HPV vaccine beyond informing them about the benefits to men alone. Predictors of HPV vaccine acceptability were also identified.\nMETHODS: Heterosexual male college students (n = 356) were randomly assigned to receive a self-protection versus a self-protection and partner protection message about HPV and the quadrivalent HPV vaccine. Participants provided demographic and sexual history information, HPV-related awareness and knowledge, health beliefs, and HPV vaccination intentions.\nRESULTS: : Men reported moderate interest in the HPV vaccine; vaccine acceptability did not differ by experimental condition. A multivariate regression model identified several independent predictors of HPV vaccine acceptability including sexual activity, perceived susceptibility to HPV, perceived benefits of the vaccine, perceived hassle and cost of vaccination, self-efficacy for vaccination, and perceived norms for vaccination.\nCONCLUSION: Informing men about the benefits of male HPV vaccination for reducing cervical cancer risk in women did not increase men's interest in the vaccine.

Despite the role of HPV in several preneoplastic and cancerous lesions in men, male vaccine coverage is low. This article aims to provide insights into the pathophysiology of HPV-related penile cancer and penile intraepithelial neoplasia (PeIN). Moreover, this review endeavors to outline the advantages of implementing HPV vaccination in male vaccination programs and the role of health care providers in this mission.\nDATA SOURCES: This is a narrative review of relevant literature. A search on PubMed and Cochrane database was conducted. The following search terms were used: HPV vaccination, gender-neutral vaccination, male, genital warts, penile cancer, vaccine recommendations.\nCONCLUSION: HPV is responsible for 50.8% of penile cancers globally, 79.8% of PeIN, and 90% of genital warts. In 2009 the Food and Drug Administration licensed the quadrivalent HPV vaccine for use in males, with a potential efficacy of 90% and 77.5% to reduce genital warts and anal intraepithelial neoplasia, respectively. However, the uptake of HPV vaccination in men is low, and gender-neutral vaccination is estimated to be implemented only in 42 countries worldwide. Because data in penile cancer are lacking, further research is needed to study the efficacy of incorporation of HPV vaccines in male vaccination programs on preventing penile cancer and PeIN.\nIMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: Nurses and other members of the multidisciplinary team should take every opportunity to recommend HPV vaccination in adolescent men. Moreover, they play an important role in raising community awareness about the incidence of HPV and the related range of diseases.

The decision to analyse HPV-related diseases in males was due to the broad dissemination of the virus, and, above all, by the need to stress the importance of primary and secondary prevention measures (currently available for women exclusively). The objective of the Consensus Conference was to make evidence-based recommendations that were designed to facilitate the adoption of a standard approach in clinical practice in Italy.\nMETHODS: The Sponsoring Panel put a series of questions to the members of the Scientific Committee who prepared a summary of the currently available information, relevant for each question, after the review and grading of the existing scientific literature. The summaries were presented to a Jury, also called multidisciplinary Consensus Panel, who drafted a series of recommendations.\nRESULTS: The prevalence of HPV in males ranges between 1.3-72.9%;. The prevalence curve in males is much higher than that in females and does not tend to decline with age. Women appear to have a higher probability of acquiring HPV genotypes associated with a high oncogenic risk, whereas in males the probability of acquiring low- or high-risk genotypes is similar. The HPV-related diseases that affect males are anogenital warts and cancers of the penis, anus and oropharynx. The quadrivalent vaccine against HPV has proved to be effective in preventing external genital lesions in males aged 16-26 years in 90.4%; (95%; CI: 69.2-98.1) of cases. It has also proved to be effective in preventing precancerous anal lesions in 77.5%; (95%; CI: 39.6-93.3) of cases in a per-protocol analysis and in 91.7%; (95%; CI: 44.6-99.8) of cases in a post-hoc analysis. Early ecological studies demonstrate reduction of genital warts in vaccinated females and some herd immunity in males when vaccine coverage is high, although males who have sex with males gained no benefit at all. Males with an immunodeficiency disease are at greater risk of developing disease. Infertility seems to be caused by HPV in some cases. Studies demonstrate vaccination to both genders can be more efficacious and social equity matters are to be taken into consideration.\nCONCLUSIONS: The Jury made Recommendations based on the scientific evidence presented by the Scientific Committee. Accordingly, for prevention purposes and social fairness and equality, as both sexes are affected by the disease, the vaccination of 12-year-old males against HPV should be recommended in order to guaranty protection to everyone. Aspects related to healthcare policy and economic sustainability, are to be discussed by respective public system representatives.

Physicians agreed that males should be vaccinated to prevent them from getting genital and anal warts (52.9% strongly and 36.0% somewhat) and to protect females from cervical cancer (75.3% strongly and 20.8% somewhat). Physicians agreed that an HPV vaccine recommendation for males would increase opportunities to discuss sexual health with adolescent male patients (58.7% strongly, 35.3% somewhat). Most did not strongly agree (15.4% strongly, 45.4% somewhat) that parents of adolescent male patients would be interested in HPV vaccination for males, that a gender-neutral HPV vaccine recommendation would increase acceptance by adolescent females and their parents (19.6% strongly, 42.0% somewhat), or that a gender-neutral recommendation would improve current female vaccination rates (10.4% strongly, 26.0% somewhat).\nCONCLUSIONS: Physicians who currently vaccinate females against HPV supported the concept of vaccinating males for its benefits for both sexes. They agreed that a gender-neutral HPV vaccination recommendation would be appropriate with regard to public health and believed that it would increase opportunities for sexual health discussions, but were less sure that such a recommendation would change patient or parental attitudes toward HPV vaccination or improve current HPV vaccination efforts.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23167429": "The recent policy statement by the Cancer Council of Australia on infant circumcision and cancer prevention and the announcement that the quadrivalent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine will be made available for boys in Australia prompted us to provide an assessment of genital cancer prevention.

Public HPV vaccination programs are now the norm for women aged 9-45 years and men aged 9-26 years in Canada. Yet, only recently have guidelines begun to consider vaccination of men older than 26 years of age. There now exist compelling reasons to recommend vaccination against HPV amongst males >26 years of age. Recognizing that the risks posed by HPV infection persist beyond 26 years of age, that the vaccination of men aged 26-45 years with HPV vaccine confers immunogenicity at levels demonstrably efficacious against HPV-related diseases, and that the Food and Drug Administration recently expanded the HPV vaccination to include older men, it is argued that HPV vaccination in men older than 26 years of age should be routinely recommended.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26734596": "Human papillomavirus (HPV) causes roughly 1.6% of the plus 1.6 million cases of cancer that are diagnosed in the United States each year. Despite the proven safety and efficacy of available vaccines, HPV remains the most common sexually transmitted infection. Underlying the high prevalence of HPV infection is the poor adherence to the Centers for Disease Control recommendation to vaccinate all 11- to 12-year-old males and females. In fact, only about 38 and 14% of eligible females and males, respectively, receive the complete, three-dose immunization. The many factors associated with missed HPV vaccination opportunities - including race, age, family income, and patient education - contribute to widespread disparities in vaccine completion and related health outcomes. Beyond patient circumstance, however, research indicates that the rigor and consistency of recommendation by primary care providers also plays a significant role in uptake of HPV immunization. Health disparities data are of vital importance to HPV vaccination campaigns because they can provide insight into how to address current problems and allocate limited resources where they are most needed. Furthermore, even modest gains in populations with low vaccination rates may yield great benefits because HPV immunization has been shown to provide herd immunity, indirect protection for non-immunized individuals achieved by limiting the spread of an infectious agent through a population. However, the impact of current HPV vaccination campaigns is hindered by stagnant immunization rates, which remain far below target levels despite a slow overall increase. Furthermore, gains in immunization are not equally distributed across gender, age, demographic, and socioeconomic divisions within the recommended group of vaccine recipients. To achieve the greatest impact, public health campaigns should focus on improving immunization coverage where it is weakest. They should also explore more subtle but potentially significant determinants of HPV vaccine initiation and completion, such as the attitudes of parents and healthcare providers and factors that exacerbate HPV-related health outcomes, including smoking and human immunodeficiency virus-mediated immunosuppression. Optimizing the efficacy of vaccination campaigns will require a health disparities approach that both identifies and remedies the underlying causes of population differences in HPV vaccination.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35471242": "BACKGROUND: Despite the high risks associated with human papillomavirus (HPV), the HPV vaccination rate of men is far lower than women.

Oncogenic HPV is strongly associated with cancers and high-grade dysplasias of the anogenital tract, including the anus, penis, and also a proportion of oropharyngeal cancers. In reducing male disease burden, some consider screening and treatment for high-grade anal dysplasia (AIN) to prevent anal cancer in high-risk populations. Such strategies have wide implications for the workforce, and require more evidence for the optimal management of AIN. Male sexual behavior, with consequent HPV infection and disease contribute to considerable disease burden in females. Hence, inclusion of males in prophylactic HPV vaccination programs should prevent HPV-related disease in males as well as substantially reducing disease burden in females. Clinical trial data in males 16-26 years for the quadrivalent vaccine show it is well tolerated, induces a strong type-specific immunological response comparable to that of females, and reduced vaccine HPV-type-related genital infection, as well as disease. Cost-benefit analyses and mathematical modeling show that the most cost-effective strategy involves routine administration of this vaccine to 12-year-old females, with catch-up vaccination of 12- to 24-year-olds, with the most effective strategy in disease reduction including men and/or boys in the program. Such a vaccination strategy including 12-year-old boys is projected by 2050 to reduce HPV 16 infection by 88-94% in females and 68-82% in males, plus the aforementioned male HPV- related cancers by 22-27%.

In South Korea, the prophylactic vaccine is recognized as prevention of cervical cancer with little attention given to male HPV vaccination. The purpose of this study was to explore perceptions of male HPV vaccination and underlying factors for vaccine hesitancy among mothers of unvaccinated boys in Seoul, Korea using a qualitative method. We used a purposive sampling strategy to recruit mothers of unvaccinated middle school-aged boys living in one of the 25 districts in Seoul, supplemented by a snowball sampling approach. We conducted one-on-one telephone interviews with ten mothers using a semi-structured interview guide. Questions probed mothers' views on vaccinating boys against HPV and the reasons for not vaccinating their sons. We found that mothers were hesitant to vaccinate their sons against HPV due to high out-of-pocket costs, fear of side effects concerning the young age of their sons, and low awareness of HPV and HPV vaccine, all of which stemmed from the exclusion of male HPV vaccination in the national immunization program. Sociocultural factors, including vaccination norms, lack of HPV education, and values associated with sexually transmitted infections were also likely to negatively impact mothers' vaccination decision-making. Despite the barriers, mothers were willing to accept HPV vaccination when it was framed as cancer prevention for not only the sons but also their future spouses. In conclusion, reasons for Korean mothers' hesitancy for their sons' HPV vaccine uptake were multifaceted. Healthcare providers' role in emphasizing and conveying the importance of gender-neutral HPV vaccination will be essential to alleviate negative sentiments around the vaccine for boys and reduce their risk of compromised sexual health.

The primary outcome was the change from baseline to week 12 in the Disease Activity Score for 28 joints based on the C-reactive protein level (DAS28-CRP). The DAS28-CRP ranges from 0 to 9.4, with higher scores indicating more severe disease. The primary comparison was between the 700-mg group and the placebo group. Secondary outcomes included the percentages of patients with American College of Rheumatology 20 (ACR20), ACR50, and ACR70 responses - defined as improvements from baseline of 20%, 50%, and 70% or more, respectively, in the numbers of tender and swollen joints and in at least three of five important domains - at week 12.\nRESULTS: At week 12, the change from baseline in the DAS28-CRP was significantly greater in the 700-mg peresolimab group than in the placebo group (least-squares mean change [\u00b1SE], -2.09\u00b10.18 vs. -0.99\u00b10.26; difference in change, -1.09 [95% confidence interval, -1.73 to -0.46]; P<0.001). The results of the analyses of secondary outcomes favored the 700-mg dose over placebo with respect to the ACR20 response but not with respect to the ACR50 and ACR70 responses. Adverse events were similar in the peresolimab and placebo groups.\nCONCLUSIONS: Peresolimab showed efficacy in a phase 2a trial in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

Data on the efficacy of novel corticosteroid formulations, developed specifically for esophageal delivery, have recently become available.\nMETHODS: A comprehensive review was performed aiming to summarize evidence on the role of STCs in the treatment of EoE. Two biomedical bibliographic databases (PubMED, EMBASE) were searched for articles providing original information on the efficacy and safety of STCs in adult EoE patients.\nRESULTS: Budesonide orodispersible tablet (BOT) and budesonide oral suspension (BOS) both surpassed placebo formulations regarding the efficacy of inducing and maintaining histologic, symptomatic and endoscopic remission. Overall, BOT displayed the highest grade of efficacy with clinico-histologic remission rates up to 75% after 1 year. Fluticasone propionate (APT-1011) achieved and maintained histologic and endoscopic responses in the majority of patients, whereas only a positive trend was demonstrated for symptomatic improvement. Mometasone and ciclesonide were studied in a limited number of smaller-scale trials and placebo-controlled data are required to substantiate the promising findings. All STCs displayed a similar side effects profile and were generally considered safe and well-tolerated.\nCONCLUSIONS: Current evidence supports long-term treatment with novel corticosteroid formulations, challenging the established treatment paradigm of EoE.

The mechanisms underlying disease development and progression are influenced by diverse factors, such as genetics, age, allergic comorbidities, and allergen exposures. Central to EoE pathophysiology is a dysregulated feed-forward cycle that develops between the esophageal epithelium and the immune system. Allergen-induced, type 2-biased immune activation by the esophageal epithelium propagates a cycle of impaired mucosal barrier integrity and allergic inflammation, eventually leading to tissue remodeling and progressive organ dysfunction. Herein, we review the current understanding of fundamental pathophysiological mechanisms contributing to EoE pathogenesis.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37064719": "INTRODUCTION: Under homeostatic conditions, esophageal epithelium displays a proliferation/differentiation gradient that is generated as proliferative basal cells give rise to suprabasal cells then terminally differentiated superficial cells. This proliferation/differentiation gradient is often perturbed in esophageal pathologies. Basal cell hyperplasia may occur in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), a condition in which acid from the stomach enters the esophagus, or eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), an emerging form of food allergy. While GERD is a primary risk factor for esophageal cancer, epidemiological data suggests that EoE patients do not develop esophageal cancer.\nMETHODS: In order to investigate the impact of EoE and esophageal cancer specifically on the cellular landscape of esophageal epithelium, we perform single cell RNA-sequencing in murine models of EoE and esophageal cancer, specifically esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). We further evaluate modules of co-expressed genes in EoE- and ESCC-enriched epithelial cell clusters. Finally, we pair EoE and ESCC murine models to examine the functional relationship between these pathologies.\nRESULTS: In mice with either EoE or ESCC, we find expansion of cell populations as compared to normal esophageal epithelium. In mice with EoE, we detect distinct expansion of 4 suprabasal populations coupled with depletion of 2 basal populations. By contrast, mice with ESCC display unique expansion of 2 basal populations and 1 suprabasal population, as well as depletion of 2 suprabasal populations. Senescence, glucocorticoid receptor signaling, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor pathways are associated with EoE-enriched clusters while pathways associated with cell proliferation and metabolism are identified in ESCC-enriched clusters. Finally, our in vivo data demonstrate that exposure to EoE inflammation limits tumor burden of esophageal carcinogenesis.\nDISCUSSION: Our findings provide the first functional investigation of the relationship between EoE and esophageal cancer and suggest that esophageal epithelial remodeling events occurring in response to EoE inflammation may limit esophageal carcinogenesis. This investigation may have future implications for leveraging allergic inflammation-associated alterations in epithelial biology to prevent and/or treat esophageal cancer.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20353445": "Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) and reflux esophagitis (RE) overlap clinically and histologically. RE is characterized by epithelial infiltration with small numbers of neutrophils and eosinophils, EoE by a prominent eosinophilic infiltrate. Lymphocytic esophagitis (LE), a new entity characterized by peripapillary lymphocytosis, questions the role lymphocytes play in esophageal inflammation. We test the hypothesis that lymphocyte infiltration in RE differs from EoE. One blinded pathologist read esophageal biopsies from 39 RE and 39 EoE patients. Both groups demonstrated significant numbers of lymphocytes (RE 22.7 +/- 2.2/HPF, EoE 19.8 +/- 1.8/HPF). Eosinophils/HPF in RE and EoE were 2.8 +/- 0.7 and 74.9 +/- 8.2, respectively (P < 0.001). Neutrophils were uncommon in RE (0.26 +/- 0.16/HPF) and EoE (0.09 +/- 0.04; P = 0.07). Eight of the 39 RE specimens had >or=50 lymphocytes in >or=1 HPF. Two were consistent with LE. There was an inverse correlation between numbers of eosinophils and lymphocytes in EoE (R = -0.47; P = 0.002), and no correlation between them in RE (R = 0.18; P = 0.36). The patients with EoE who used antireflux medications had fewer lymphocytes (16.3 +/- 1.3 vs 22.2 +/- 2.3/HPF; P = 0.030) and eosinophils (55.6 +/- 5.2 vs 76.0 +/- 8.7/HPF; P = 0.042) than those who did not. The pathological role of lymphocytes in RE and EoE may be underestimated. Our observation that 5% of the RE specimens meet histopathological criteria for LE potentially blurs the line between these entities.

Identifying clinical and endoscopic characteristics that distinguish EoE could provide a more comprehensive diagnostic strategy than the present criteria. The aim of the study was to determine symptoms and signs that can be used to distinguish EoE from reflux esophagitis.\nMETHODS: Adult and pediatric patients with EoE were identified by present diagnostic guidelines including an esophageal biopsy finding of \u226515 eosinophils/HPF. Patients with GERD were age-matched one to one with patients with EoE. Clinical, endoscopic, and histologic information at the time of diagnosis was obtained from the medical record and compared between pairs by McNemar test. A conditional logistic regression model was created using 6 distinguishing disease characteristics. This model was used to create a nomogram to differentiate EoE from reflux-induced esophagitis.\nRESULTS: Patients with EoE were 75% men and 68% had a history of atopy. Many aspects of EoE were statistically distinct from GERD when controlling for age. Male sex, dysphagia, history of food impaction, absence of pain/heartburn, linear furrowing, and white papules were the distinguishing variables used to create the logistic regression model and scoring system based on odds ratios.

We report the cases of two young males suffering from dysphagia and recurrent food impaction with reflux esophagitis and more than 20 eo/HPF in upper-mid esophagus biopsies, both of which became asymptomatic on proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy. The first patient also achieved a histologic response, while EE remained in the other patient after effective PPI treatment, as shown by 24-h esophageal pH monitoring. Topical steroid therapy combined with PPI led to complete remission in this latter patient. GERD and EE may be undistinguishable, even by histology, so diagnosis of EE should only be established after a careful correlation of clinical, endoscopic and pathologic data obtained under vigorous acid suppression. These diagnostic difficulties are maximal when both diseases overlap. Limited data are available about this topic, and the interaction between EE and GERD is a matter of debate. In this setting, upper-mid esophagus step biopsies and esophageal pH monitoring of patients on PPI therapy are pivotal to evaluate the role of each disease.

Most adults present with dysphagia, food impaction, heartburn or chest pain. Common endoscopic features in adults with EoE include linear furrows (creases that orient longitudinally), mucosal rings (esophageal \"trachealization\"), small-caliber esophagus, white plaques or exudates (which are microabscesses of eosinophils), and strictures. Children often present with similar endoscopic features, but one-third of pediatric patients with EoE have normal endoscopy. Histological features of EoE include increased intramucosal eosinophils in the esophagus (\u226515 eosinophils/high-power field) without similar findings in the stomach or duodenum. There also may be eosinophilic microabscesses. In addition to evidence of mast cell activation, mucosa from patients with EoE have increased IL-5, supporting eosinophilia, and up-regulation of gene expression of eotaxin-3, a chemokine important in eosinophil migration.

However, several recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of proton pump inhibition (PPI) in reducing symptoms and histopathology in a subset of patients with esophageal eosinophilia and suspected EoE, leading to the terminology \"PPI responsive esophageal eosinophilia.\" It remains uncertain as to whether these patients have EoE, GERD, or a PPI responsive esophageal inflammatory condition that is distinct from either GERD or EoE. Emerging translational research has evidenced mechanisms by which PPI response in patients with esophageal eosinophilia may be a consequence of PPI effects on the immune pathogenesis of EoE. Therefore, a symptom and histologic response to PPI in patients with esophageal eosinophilia does not necessarily \"rule in\" GERD.

The diagnosis of EoE was based on International Consensus Criteria. Age, gender, weight loss, history of atopy, dysphagia, history of food impaction, proton pump inhibitor (PPI) refractory heartburn, odynophagia, peripheral eosinophilia, and serum IgE were analyzed.

A stepwise procedure of logistic regression led to a model in which 3 out of the initial 10 items were found to be relevant for differentiating GERD and EoE.

Bacterial load was determined using quantitative PCR. Bacterial communities, determined by 16S rRNA gene amplification and 454 pyrosequencing, were compared between health and disease.\nRESULTS: Samples from a total of 70 children and adult subjects were examined. Bacterial load was increased in both EoE and GERD relative to normal subjects. In subjects with EoE, load was increased regardless of treatment status or degree of mucosal eosinophilia compared with normal. Haemophilus was significantly increased in untreated EoE subjects as compared with normal subjects.

Sepsis-induced autophagy activation was protective in effector CD4 + T cells and was blocked by rIL-35. The inhibitory effect of IL-35 on autophagy was observed in activated effector CD4 + T cells in vitro , and this effect was mediated by restricting high mobility group box-1 protein (HMGB1) translocation.

We suggest that similar effects are operational in human disease and IL-35-directed therapies hold significant promise. In particular, we emphasize that IL-35 has immunosuppressive ability that are mediated via regulatory T and B cells that are IL-10 dependent.

Whereas IL-12 and IL-23 are clearly proinflammatory cytokines, the role of IL-35 is less clear. In mice, IL-35 appears to be anti-inflammatory and to protect from autoimmune inflammatory diseases. IL-35 induces the expansion of a subset of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and Bregs and mediates their suppressive function and inhibits Th17 cells. It also upregulates osteoprotegerin and suppresses RANKL, thus inhibiting bone resorption. In autoimmune rheumatic diseases, findings are conflicting, although in systemic lupus erythematosus, there is reduced function of IL-35. In psoriatic arthritis, a disease characterized by bone erosion and bone formation in peripheral joints and bone formation in spinal joints, serum levels of IL-35 were found increased in one study.

The present study aimed (i) to measure serum IL-35 levels and the percentages of Bregs in the peripheral blood of patients with AS and (ii) to explore their relationships in the pathogenesis of AS.\nMETHODS: A total of 77 patients with AS (AS group), including 47 inactive AS and 30 active AS cases, and 59 healthy controls (HCs) were enrolled into this study. The serum levels of IL-35 and IL-10 were detected by ELISA, and the mRNA levels of p35 and EBI3 were measured by RT-qPCR.

Interleukin-35 (IL-35), a cytokine of the interleukin-12 family, is a novel anti-inflammation and immunosuppressive cytokine, maintaining inflammatory suppression and regulating immune homeostasis. The role of IL-35 in cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) has aroused enthusiastic attention, a diversity of experimental or clinical evidence has indicated that IL-35 potentially has a pivot role in protecting against cardiovascular diseases, especially atherosclerosis and myocarditis. In this review, we initiate an overview of the relationship between Interleukin-35 and cardiovascular diseases, including atherosclerosis, acute coronary syndrome, pulmonary hypertension, abdominal aortic aneurysm, heart failure, myocardial ischemia-reperfusion, aortic dissection and myocarditis. Although the specific molecular mechanisms entailing the protective effects of IL-35 remain an unsolved issue, targeted therapies with IL-35 might provide a promising and effective solution to prevent and cure cardiovascular diseases.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36690705": "Patients with metastatic NSCLC bearing a ROS1 gene fusion usually experience prolonged disease control with ROS1-targeting tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), but significant clinical heterogeneity exists in part due to the presence of co-occurring genomic alterations. Here, we report on a patient with metastatic NSCLC with a concurrent ROS1 fusion and KRAS p.G12C mutation at diagnosis who experienced a short duration of disease control on entrectinib, a ROS1 TKI. At progression, the patient continued entrectinib and started sotorasib, a small molecule inhibitor of KRAS p.G12C. A patient-derived cell line generated at progression on entrectinib demonstrated improved TKI responsiveness when treated with entrectinib and sotorasib. Cell-line growth dependence on both ROS1 and KRAS p.G12C was further reflected in the distinct downstream signaling pathways activated by each driver. Clinical benefit was not observed with combined therapy of entrectinib and sotorasib possibly related to an evolving KRAS p.G12C amplification identified on repeated molecular testing.

As designed, the assay is capable of detecting small molecules that act to allosterically modulate GDP affinity or directly compete with the bound nucleotide. A pilot screen was completed to demonstrate robust statistics and reproducibility followed by a primary screen using a diversity library totaling over 83,000 compounds. Compounds yielding >50% inhibition of TR-FRET signal were selected as hits for testing in dose-response format. The most promising hit, UNC10104889, was further investigated through a structure activity relationship (SAR)-by-catalog approach in an attempt to improve potency and circumvent solubility liabilities.

We compared the efficacy and safety of sotorasib with a standard-of-care treatment in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with the KRASG12C mutation who had been previously treated with other anticancer drugs.\nMETHODS: We conducted a randomised, open-label phase 3 trial at 148 centres in 22 countries. We recruited patients aged at least 18 years with KRASG12C-mutated advanced NSCLC, who progressed after previous platinum-based chemotherapy and a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor. Key exclusion criteria included new or progressing untreated brain lesions or symptomatic brain lesions, previously identified oncogenic driver mutation other than KRASG12C for which an approved therapy is available (eg EGFR or ALK), previous treatment with docetaxel (neoadjuvant or adjuvant docetaxel was allowed if the tumour did not progress within 6 months after the therapy was terminated), previous treatment with a direct KRASG12C inhibitor, systemic anticancer therapy within 28 days of study day 1, and therapeutic or palliative radiation therapy within 2 weeks of treatment initiation. We randomly assigned (1:1) patients to oral sotorasib (960 mg once daily) or intravenous docetaxel (75 mg/m2 once every 3 weeks) in an open-label manner using interactive response technology. Randomisation was stratified by number of previous lines of therapy in advanced disease (1 vs 2 vs &gt;2), ethnicity (Asian vs non-Asian), and history of CNS metastases (present or absent). Treatment continued until an independent central confirmation of disease progression, intolerance, initiation of another anticancer therapy, withdrawal of consent, or death, whichever occurred first. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival, which was assessed by a blinded, independent central review in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was assessed in all treated patients. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04303780, and is active but no longer recruiting.\nFINDINGS: Between June 4, 2020, and April 26, 2021, 345 patients were randomly assigned to receive sotorasib (n=171 [50%]) or docetaxel (n=174 [50%]). 169 (99%) patients in the sotorasib group and 151 (87%) in the docetaxel group received at least one dose. After a median follow-up of 17\u00b77 months (IQR 16\u00b74-20\u00b71), the study met its primary endpoint of a statistically significant increase in the progression-free survival for sotorasib, compared with docetaxel (median progression-free survival 5\u00b76 months [95% CI 4\u00b73-7\u00b78] vs 4\u00b75 months [3\u00b70-5\u00b77]; hazard ratio 0\u00b766 [0\u00b751-0\u00b786]; p=0\u00b70017). Sotorasib was well tolerated, with fewer grade 3 or worse (n=56 [33%] vs n=61 [40%]) and serious treatment-related adverse events compared with docetaxel (n=18 [11%] vs n=34 [23%]). For sotorasib, the most common treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or worse were diarrhoea (n= 20 [12%]), alanine aminotransferase increase (n=13 [8%]), and aspartate aminotransferase increase (n=9 [5%]). For docetaxel, the most common treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or worse were neutropenia (n=13 [9%]), fatigue (n=9 [6%]), and febrile neutropenia (n=8 [5%]).\nINTERPRETATION: Sotorasib significantly increased progression-free survival and had a more favourable safety profile, compared with docetaxel, in patients with advanced NSCLC with the KRASG12C mutation and who had been previously treated with other anticancer drugs.\nFUNDING: Amgen.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36581205": "The small GTPase KRAS is frequently mutated in pancreatic cancer and its cooperation with the transcription factor MYC is essential for malignant transformation. The key to oncogenic KRAS and MYC working together is the stabilization of MYC expression due to KRAS activating the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, which phosphorylates MYC at serine 62 (Ser 62). This prevents the proteasomal degradation of MYC while enhancing its transcriptional activity. Here, we identify how this essential signaling connection between oncogenic KRAS and MYC expression is mediated by the inhibitor of apoptosis protein family member Survivin. This discovery stemmed from our finding that Survivin expression is downregulated upon treatment of pancreatic cancer cells with the KRASG12C inhibitor Sotorasib. We went on to show that oncogenic KRAS increases Survivin expression by activating extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 in pancreatic cancer cells and that treating the cells either with siRNAs targeting Survivin or with YM155, a small molecule that potently blocks Survivin expression, downregulates MYC and strongly inhibited their growth. We further determined that Survivin protects MYC from degradation by blocking autophagy, which then prevents cellular inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A from undergoing autophagic degradation. Cellular inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A, by inhibiting protein phosphatase 2A, helps to maintain MYC phosphorylation at Ser 62, thereby ensuring its cooperation with oncogenic KRAS in driving cancer progression. Overall, these findings highlight a novel role for Survivin in mediating the cooperative actions of KRAS and MYC during malignant transformation and raise the possibility that targeting Survivin may offer therapeutic benefits against KRAS-driven cancers.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36577165": "The KRAS oncogene is present in up to 25% of solid tumors and for decades had been undruggable.

CodeBreaK 200 found an improvement in the primary endpoint of progression-free survival (PFS), but overall survival, a key secondary endpoint, was not improved. However, critical questions about the trial's design may limit inferences regarding the reported results. The control arm treatment was inferior to the best standard of care. A late protocol modification (which lowered the sample size and allowed a problematic crossover) prohibited the trial from making a determination regarding overall survival. Imbalance in censoring rates, with potential informative censoring, makes PFS estimates unreliable. Quality-of-life data were also limited.

However, most patients develop resistance to these targeted therapies, and we lack effective treatments for other KRAS mutants. To accelerate the development of RAS targeting therapies, we need to fully characterise the molecular mechanisms governing KRAS signalling networks and determine what differentiates the signalling downstream of the KRAS mutants. Here we have used affinity purification mass-spectrometry proteomics to characterise the interactome of KRAS wild-type and three KRAS mutants. Bioinformatic analysis associated with experimental validation allows us to map the signalling network mediated by the different KRAS proteins. Using this approach, we characterised how the interactome of KRAS wild-type and mutants is regulated by the clinically approved KRASG12C inhibitor Sotorasib.

Subjects received single oral doses of metformin 850 mg, sotorasib 960 mg, and metformin 850 mg with sotorasib 960 mg. Urine and plasma were collected and assayed for metformin and sotorasib pharmacokinetics. Blood glucose was also measured for metformin pharmacodynamics.

Clinical trials on the therapeutic use of sotorasib for cancer have reported promising results. However, KRASG12C-mutant cancers can acquire resistance to sotorasib after treatment. We incidentally discovered that sotorasib-resistant (SR) cancer cells are addicted to this inhibitor. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms underlying sotorasib addiction.\nMETHODS: Sotorasib-resistant cells were established using KRASG12C-mutant pancreatic cancer and NSCLC cell lines. Cell viability in the presence or absence of sotorasib and in combination with multiple inhibitors was assessed through proliferation assay and annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) flow cytometry assays. The mechanisms underlying drug addiction were elucidated through 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation assay, immunofluorescence staining, time-lapse microscopy, and comet assay. Furthermore, a subcutaneous xenograft model was used to demonstrate sotorasib addiction in vivo.\nRESULTS: In the absence of sotorasib, the sotorasib-resistant cells underwent p21Waf1/Cip1-mediated cell cycle arrest and caspase-dependent apoptosis. Sotorasib withdrawal resulted in robust activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, inducing severe DNA damage and replication stress, which activated the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway. Persistent MAPK pathway hyperactivation with DDR exhaustion led to premature mitotic entry and aberrant mitosis, followed by micronucleus and nucleoplasmic bridge formation. Pharmacologic activation of the MAPK pathway with a type I BRAF inhibitor could further enhance the effects of sotorasib withdrawal on sotorasib-resistant cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo.\nCONCLUSIONS: We elucidated the mechanisms underlying the sotorasib addiction of cancer cells. Sotorasib addiction appears to be mediated through MAPK pathway hyperactivity, DNA damage, replication stress, and mitotic catastrophe.

Silencing ITGB4 in tolerant cells improved sotorasib sensitivity, while overexpressing ITGB4 enhanced tolerance to sotorasib by supporting AKT-mTOR bypass signaling.

We explored the signalling pathways activated in these resistant cell lines and their roles in sotorasib resistance.\nRESULTS: The resistant cells exhibited increased cell-matrix adhesion with increased levels of stress fibres and focal adherens. p21-activated kinases (PAKs) were activated in resistant cells, which phosphorylate MEK at serine 298 of MEK and serine 338 of c-Raf to activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway.

The underlying mechanisms of resistance were investigated using immunologic examination, and a treatment aimed at overcoming resistance was tested in vitro and in vivo.\nRESULTS: Unbiased screening detected subclonal evolution of MET amplification in KRAS G12C NSCLC cells that had developed resistance to sotorasib in vitro. MET knockdown using small interfering RNA (siRNA) restored susceptibility to sotorasib in these resistant cells. MET activation by its amplification reinforced RAS cycling from its inactive form to its active form. In addition to RAS-mediated MEK-ERK induction, MET induced AKT activation independently of RAS.

Based on promising results in both preclinical and clinical trials, sotorasib, a novel KRASG12C inhibitor, was given conditional approval by the FDA in May 2021. The Phase I portion of the clinical trial produced 32% confirmed response with 56% of patients with stable disease. About 91.2% of patients who received the highest dose of 960mg daily achieved disease control.

Cell viability, proliferation, and death were measured by MTT, cell counting, colony analyses, and annexin V staining for FACS. Cell tracker dyes were used to investigate cell morphology, which was examined by holotomograpy, and confocal microscopes. RNA sequencing was performed to identify key target molecule or pathway, which was confirmed by qRT-PCR, western blotting, and metabolite analyses by UHPLC-MS/MS. Zebrafish and mouse xenograft model were used for in vivo analysis.\nRESULTS: In this study, we found that nutlin-3a, an MDM2 antagonist, inhibited the KRAS-PI3K/Akt-mTOR pathway and disrupted the fusion of both autophagosomes and macropinosomes with lysosomes. This further elucidated non-apoptotic and catastrophic macropinocytosis associated methuosis-like cell death, which was found to be dependent on GFPT2 of the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway, specifically in KRAS mutant /p53 wild type NSCLC cells.\nCONCLUSION: These results indicate the potential of nutlin-3a as an alternative agent for treating KRAS mutant/p53 wild type NSCLC cells.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38072173": "KRAS G12C mutations in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) partially respond to KRAS G12C covalent inhibitors. However, early adaptive resistance occurs due to rewiring of signaling pathways, activating receptor tyrosine kinases, primarily EGFR, but also MET and ligands. Evidence indicates that treatment with KRAS G12C inhibitors (sotorasib) triggers the MRAS:SHOC2:PP1C trimeric complex. Activation of MRAS occurs from alterations in the Scribble and Hippo-dependent pathways, leading to YAP activation. Other mechanisms that involve STAT3 signaling are intertwined with the activation of MRAS. The high-resolution MRAS:SHOC2:PP1C crystallization structure allows in silico analysis for drug development. Activation of MRAS:SHOC2:PP1C is primarily Scribble-driven and downregulated by HUWE1. The reactivation of the MRAS complex is carried out by valosin containing protein (VCP). Exploring these pathways as therapeutic targets and their impact on different chemotherapeutic agents (carboplatin, paclitaxel) is crucial.

Small molecules such as sotorasib are now the first targeted drugs for KRAS G12C mutation, preventing conversion of the mutant protein to GTP-bound active state. Little is known about primary or acquired resistance. Acquired resistance does occur and may be due to genetic alterations in the nucleotide exchange function or adaptative mechanisms in either downstream pathways or in newly expressed KRAS G12C mutation.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34004237": "Sotorasib is a first-in class KRASG12C covalent inhibitor in clinical development for the treatment of tumors with the KRAS p.G12C mutation. In the nonclinical toxicology studies of sotorasib, the kidney was identified as a target organ of toxicity in the rat but not the dog. Renal toxicity was characterized by degeneration and necrosis of the proximal tubular epithelium localized to the outer stripe of the outer medulla (OSOM), which suggested that renal metabolism was involved. Here, we describe an in vivo mechanistic rat study designed to investigate the time course of the renal toxicity and sotorasib metabolites. Renal toxicity was dose- and time-dependent, restricted to the OSOM, and the morphologic features progressed from vacuolation and necrosis to regeneration of tubular epithelium. The renal toxicity correlated with increases in renal biomarkers of tubular injury. Using mass spectrometry and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization, a strong temporal and spatial association between renal toxicity and mercapturate pathway metabolites was observed. The rat is reported to be particularly susceptible to the formation of nephrotoxic metabolites via this pathway. Taken together, the data presented here and the literature support the hypothesis that sotorasib-related renal toxicity is mediated by a toxic metabolite derived from the mercapturate and \u03b2-lyase pathway.

The targeting of RAS with drugs is challenging because RAS lacks classic and tractable drug binding sites. Over the past 30 years, this perception has led to the pursuit of indirect routes for targeting RAS expression, processing, upstream regulators, or downstream effectors. After the discovery that the KRAS-G12C variant contains a druggable pocket below the switch-II loop region, it has become possible to design irreversible covalent inhibitors for the variant with improved potency, selectivity and bioavailability. Two such inhibitors, sotorasib (AMG 510) and adagrasib (MRTX849), were recently evaluated in phase I-III trials for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer with KRAS-G12C mutations, heralding a new era of precision oncology. In this review, we outline the mutations and functions of KRAS in human tumors and then analyze indirect and direct approaches to shut down the oncogenic KRAS network. Specifically, we discuss the mechanistic principles, clinical features, and strategies for overcoming primary or secondary resistance to KRAS-G12C blockade.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33971321": "INTRODUCTION: KRAS mutations have been recognized as undruggable for many years. Recently, novel KRAS G12C inhibitors, such as sotorasib and adagrasib, are being developed in clinical trials and have revealed promising results in metastatic NSCLC. Nevertheless, it is strongly anticipated that acquired resistance will limit their clinical use. In this study, we developed in\u00a0vitro models of the KRAS G12C cancer, derived from resistant clones against sotorasib and adagrasib, and searched for secondary KRAS mutations as on-target resistance mechanisms to develop possible strategies to overcome such resistance.\nMETHODS: We chronically exposed Ba/F3 cells transduced with KRASG12C to sotorasib or adagrasib in the presence of N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea and searched for secondary KRAS mutations. Strategies to overcome resistance were also investigated.\nRESULTS: We generated 142 Ba/F3 clones resistant to either sotorasib or adagrasib, of which 124 (87%) harbored secondary KRAS mutations. There were 12 different secondary KRAS mutations. Y96D and Y96S were resistant to both inhibitors. A combination of novel SOS1 inhibitor, BI-3406, and trametinib had potent activity against this resistance. Although G13D, R68M, A59S and A59T, which were highly resistant to sotorasib, remained sensitive to adagrasib, Q99L was resistant to adagrasib but sensitive to sotorasib.\nCONCLUSIONS: We identified many secondary KRAS mutations causing resistance to sotorasib, adagrasib, or both, in\u00a0vitro. The differential activities of these two inhibitors depending on the secondary mutations suggest sequential use in some cases. In addition, switching to BI-3406 plus trametinib might be a useful strategy to overcome acquired resistance owing to the secondary Y96D and Y96S mutations.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36388799": "BACKGROUND: Primary pulmonary sarcoma (PPS) is very rare relative to other subtypes of lung cancer. Therefore, evidence-based treatment options for PPS patients have remained unclear. Identification of actionable cancer driver mutations in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has provided the chance to use targeted treatments and improve patient clinical outcomes. In addition to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), the wide use of high-throughput genomic profiling with next-generation sequencing (NGS) has also identified other cancer driver genes such as Kirsten rat sarcoma (KRAS), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), and mesenchymal epithelial transition (MET).\nCASE DESCRIPTION: In our study, we reported a locally advanced PPS patient harboring KRAS G12C mutation. The clinical stage before neoadjuvant treatment was stage IIIB (c.T3N2M0). The direct KRAS G12C inhibitor sotorasib (AMG-510) was used as neoadjuvant treatment and the patient achieved complete response (CR). Then, the patient underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) with reserved spontaneous breathing for surgical resection. The pathological evaluation was indicative of pathological CR (pCR).

We aimed to investigate the activity and safety of sotorasib in phase 2 of the trial.\nMETHODS: In this single-arm, phase 2 trial, adult patients with KRASG12C-mutated advanced solid tumours were enrolled, from 59 medical centres in 11 countries, if they were aged 18 years or older, had at least one measurable lesion according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) version 1.1, and had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 1 or lower. Only data for patients with colorectal cancer, enrolled at 33 medical centres in nine countries, are presented from this basket trial. To be enrolled, the patients had to have progressed after receiving fluoropyrimidine, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan treatment. These patients were administered 960 mg sotorasib orally once per day until disease progression, development of unacceptable side-effects, withdrawal of consent, or death. The primary endpoint was objective response (complete or partial response) as assessed by blinded independent central review. Response was evaluated in patients who received at least one dose of sotorasib and had at least one measurable lesion at baseline; safety was evaluated in patients who received at least one dose of sotorasib. This analysis is a prespecified analysis triggered by the phase 2 colorectal cancer cohort.

Objective response was observed in six (9\u00b77%, 95% CI 3\u00b76-19\u00b79) of 62 patients, all with partial response. Treatment-related adverse events at grade 3 occurred in six (10%) patients, the most common of which was diarrhoea (two [3%] of 62 patients), and at grade 4 occurred in one (2%) patient (blood creatine phosphokinase increase); no fatal events were recorded. Serious treatment-related adverse events occurred in two (3%) patients (back pain and acute kidney injury).\nINTERPRETATION: Although the 9\u00b77% overall response rate did not reach the benchmark, oral administration of sotorasib once per day showed modest anti-tumour activity and manageable safety in these heavily pretreated chemorefractory patients.

Sotorasib (AMG510), a covalent inhibitor of KRASG12C, was recently approved for the treatment of KRASG12C-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the efficacy of sotorasib and other KRASG12C inhibitors is limited by intrinsic resistance in colorectal cancer (CRC) and by the rapid emergence of acquired resistance in all treated tumors. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop novel combination therapies to overcome sotorasib resistance and to maximize its efficacy. We assessed the effect of sotorasib alone or in combination with DT2216 (a clinical-stage BCL-X<sub>L</sub> proteolysis targeting chimera [PROTAC]) on KRASG12C-mutated NSCLC, CRC and pancreatic cancer (PC) cell lines using MTS cell viability, colony formation and Annexin-V/PI apoptosis assays. Furthermore, the therapeutic efficacy of sotorasib alone and in combination with DT2216 was evaluated in vivo using different tumor xenograft models. We observed heterogeneous responses to sotorasib alone, whereas its combination with DT2216 strongly inhibited viability of KRASG12C tumor cell lines that partially responded to sotorasib treatment. Mechanistically, sotorasib treatment led to stabilization of BIM and co-treatment with DT2216 inhibited sotorasib-induced BCL-X<sub>L</sub>/BIM interaction leading to enhanced apoptosis in KRASG12C tumor cell lines. Furthermore, DT2216 co-treatment significantly improved the antitumor efficacy of sotorasib in vivo. Collectively, our findings suggest that due to cytostatic activity, the efficacy of sotorasib is limited, and therefore, its combination with a pro-apoptotic agent, i.e., DT2216, shows synergistic responses and can potentially overcome resistance.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33824136": "Mutant-selective KRASG12C inhibitors, such as MRTX849 (adagrasib) and AMG 510 (sotorasib), have demonstrated efficacy in KRAS G12C-mutant cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

To begin to define the mechanistic spectrum of acquired resistance, we describe a patient with KRAS G12C NSCLC who developed polyclonal acquired resistance to MRTX849 with the emergence of 10 heterogeneous resistance alterations in serial cell-free DNA spanning four genes (KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, MAP2K1), all of which converge to reactivate RAS-MAPK signaling. Notably, a novel KRAS Y96D mutation affecting the switch-II pocket, to which MRTX849 and other inactive-state inhibitors bind, was identified that interferes with key protein-drug interactions and confers resistance to these inhibitors in engineered and patient-derived KRAS G12C cancer models. Interestingly, a novel, functionally distinct tricomplex KRASG12C active-state inhibitor RM-018 retained the ability to bind and inhibit KRASG12C/Y96D and could overcome resistance. SIGNIFICANCE: In one of the first reports of clinical acquired resistance to KRASG12C inhibitors, our data suggest polyclonal RAS-MAPK reactivation as a central resistance mechanism. We also identify a novel KRAS switch-II pocket mutation that impairs binding and drives resistance to inactive-state inhibitors but is surmountable by a functionally distinct KRASG12C inhibitor.See related commentary by Pinnelli and Trusolino, p. 1874.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 1861.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36546651": "BACKGROUND: KRAS p.G12C mutation occurs in approximately 1 to 2% of pancreatic cancers.

The primary objective of phase 1 was to assess safety and to identify the recommended dose for phase 2. In phase 2, patients received sotorasib at a dose of 960 mg orally once daily. The primary end point for phase 2 was a centrally confirmed objective response (defined as a complete or partial response). Efficacy end points were assessed in the pooled population from both phases and included objective response, duration of response, time to objective response, disease control (defined as an objective response or stable disease), progression-free survival, and overall survival.

Herein, the strategies are summarized, which would shed light on the drug discovery for both KRAS and other \"undruggable\" targets.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34776511": "Cancer is the leading cause of death worldwide, and its treatment and outcomes have been dramatically revolutionised by targeted therapies. As the most frequently mutated oncogene, Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homologue (KRAS) has attracted substantial attention. The understanding of KRAS is constantly being updated by numerous studies on KRAS in the initiation and progression of cancer diseases. However, KRAS has been deemed a challenging therapeutic target, even \"undruggable\", after drug-targeting efforts over the past four decades. Recently, there have been surprising advances in directly targeted drugs for KRAS, especially in KRAS (G12C) inhibitors, such as AMG510 (sotorasib) and MRTX849 (adagrasib), which have obtained encouraging results in clinical trials. Excitingly, AMG510 was the first drug-targeting KRAS (G12C) to be approved for clinical use this year. This review summarises the most recent understanding of fundamental aspects of KRAS, the relationship between the KRAS mutations and tumour immune evasion, and new progress in targeting KRAS, particularly KRAS (G12C). Moreover, the possible mechanisms of resistance to KRAS (G12C) inhibitors and possible combination therapies are summarised, with a view to providing the best regimen for individualised treatment with KRAS (G12C) inhibitors and achieving truly precise treatment.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36675641": "Kristen rat sarcoma (KRAS) gene is one of the most common mutated oncogenes in solid tumors. Yet, KRAS inhibitors did not follow suit with the development of targeted therapy, for the structure of KRAS has been considered as being implausible to target for decades.

KRAS G12C inhibitors became the most recent breakthrough in targeted therapy, with Sotorasib being approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) based on its significant efficacy in multiple clinical studies. However, the subtypes of the KRAS mutations are complex, and the development of inhibitors targeting non-G12C subtypes is still at a relatively early stage. In addition, the monotherapy of KRAS inhibitors has accumulated possible resistance, acquiring the exploration of combination therapies or next-generation KRAS inhibitors. Thus, other non-target, conventional therapies have also been considered as being promising.

Cell-based experiments were conducted to study mutations that confer resistance to KRASG12C inhibitors.\nRESULTS: A total of 38 patients were included in this study: 27 with non-small-cell lung cancer, 10 with colorectal cancer, and 1 with appendiceal cancer. Putative mechanisms of resistance to adagrasib were detected in 17 patients (45% of the cohort), of whom 7 (18% of the cohort) had multiple coincident mechanisms. Acquired KRAS alterations included G12D/R/V/W, G13D, Q61H, R68S, H95D/Q/R, Y96C, and high-level amplification of the KRASG12C allele.

To address this issue, we evaluated the combination of the PAK4 inhibitor KPT9274 and KRASG12C inhibitors in preclinical models of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). PAK4 is a hub molecule that links several major signaling pathways and is known for its tumorigenic role in mutant Ras-driven cancers. We found that cancer cells resistant to KRASG12C inhibitor were sensitive to KPT9274-induced growth inhibition. Furthermore, KPT9274 synergized with sotorasib and adagrasib to inhibit the growth of KRASG12C-mutant cancer cells and reduce their clonogenic potential. Mechanistically, this combination suppressed cell growth signaling and downregulated cell-cycle markers. In a PDAC cell line-derived xenograft (CDX) model, the combination of a suboptimal dose of KPT9274 with sotorasib significantly reduced the tumor burden (P= 0.002). Similarly, potent antitumor efficacy was observed in an NSCLC CDX model, in which KPT9274, given as maintenance therapy, prevented tumor relapse following the discontinuation of sotorasib treatment (P= 0.0001). Moreover, the combination of KPT9274 and sotorasib enhances survival. In conclusion, this is the first study to demonstrate that KRASG12C inhibitors can synergize with the PAK4 inhibitor KPT9274 and combining KRASG12C inhibitors with KPT9274 can lead to remarkably enhanced antitumor activity and survival benefits, providing a novel combination therapy for patients with cancer who do not respond or develop resistance to KRASG12C inhibitor treatment.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37180506": "INTRODUCTION: Sparsentan is a novel single-molecule dual endothelin angiotensin receptor antagonist with hemodynamic and anti-inflammatory properties and is not an immunosuppressant.

End points at week 8 were reduction from baseline in UP/C (primary) and proportion of patients achieving FSGS partial remission end point (FPRE) (UP/C: \u22641.5 g/g and &gt;40% reduction [secondary]).\nRESULTS: Of 109 patients randomized, 96 received study drugs and had baseline and week 8 UP/C measurements. Sparsentan-treated patients had greater reductions in UP/C than irbesartan-treated patients did when all doses (45% versus 19%; P=0.006) or the 400 and 800 mg doses (47% versus 19%; P=0.01) were pooled for analysis. The FSGS partial remission end point was achieved in 28% of sparsentan-treated and 9% of irbesartan-treated patients (P=0.04). After 8 weeks of treatment, BP was reduced with sparsentan but not irbesartan, and eGFR was stable with both treatments. Overall, the incidence of adverse events was similar between groups. Hypotension and edema were more common among sparsentan-treated patients but did not result in study withdrawals.\nCONCLUSIONS: Patients with FSGS achieved significantly greater reductions in proteinuria after 8 weeks of sparsentan versus irbesartan.

In this study, we found that renal tissue displayed high abundance of tissue-resident lymphocytes, and the proportion of CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> cells was significantly increased in the kidney from patients and mice with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), diabetic kidney disease (DKD), and lupus nephritis (LN). Mechanistically, IL-15 significantly promoted CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> cell formation and activation, thereby promoting podocyte injury and glomerulosclerosis. Interestingly, Sparsentan, the dual angiotensin II (Ang II) receptor and endothelin type A receptor antagonist, can also reduce T<sub>RM</sub> cell responses by intervening IL-15 signaling, exploring its new pharmacological functions. Mechanistically, Sparsentan inhibited Ang II or endothelin-1 (ET-1)-mediated IL-15 signaling, thereby further regulating renal CD8+ T<sub>RM</sub> cell fates.

However, any compounds or drugs known to perturb the RAAS might have an additional impact on transmembrane ionic currents. In this retrospective review article, we aimed to present a selection of chemical compounds or medications that have long been recognized as interfering with the RAAS. It is noteworthy that these substances may also exhibit regulatory effects in different types of ionic currents. Apocynin, known to attenuate the angiotensin II-induced activation of epithelial Na+ channels, was shown to stimulate peak and late components of voltage-gated Na+ current (I<sub>Na</sub>). Esaxerenone, an antagonist of the mineralocorticoid receptor, can exert an inhibitory effect on peak and late I<sub>Na</sub> directly. Dexamethasone, a synthetic glucocorticoid, can directly enhance the open probability of large-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channels. Sparsentan, a dual-acting antagonist of the angiotensin II receptor and endothelin type A receptors, was found to suppress the amplitude of peak and late I<sub>Na</sub> effectively. However, telmisartan, a blocker of the angiotensin II receptor, was effective in stimulating the peak and late I<sub>Na</sub> along with a slowing of the inactivation time course of the current. However, telmisartan's presence can also suppress the erg-mediated K+ current. Moreover, tolvaptan, recognized as an aquaretic agent that can block the vasopressin receptor, was noted to suppress the amplitude of the delayed-rectifier K+ current and the M-type K+ current directly. The above results indicate that these substances not only have an interference effect on the RAAS but also exert regulatory effects on different types of ionic currents.

The study examines sparsentan versus irbesartan in adults (aged \u226518 years) with biopsy-proven IgA nephropathy and proteinuria of 1\u00b70 g/day or higher despite maximised renin-angiotensin system inhibitor treatment for at least 12 weeks. Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive sparsentan 400 mg once daily or irbesartan 300 mg once daily, stratified by estimated glomerular filtration rate at screening (30 to &lt;60 mL/min per 1\u00b773 m2 and \u226560 mL/min per 1\u00b773 m2) and urine protein excretion at screening (\u22641\u00b775 g/day and &gt;1\u00b775 g/day). The primary efficacy endpoint was change from baseline to week 36 in urine protein-creatinine ratio based on a 24-h urine sample, assessed using mixed model repeated measures.

At week 36, the geometric least squares mean percent change from baseline in urine protein-creatinine ratio was statistically significantly greater in the sparsentan group (-49\u00b78%) than the irbesartan group (-15\u00b71%), resulting in a between-group relative reduction of 41% (least squares mean ratio=0\u00b759; 95% CI 0\u00b751-0\u00b769; p<0\u00b70001).

In an 8-week, phase 2 trial, sparsentan, a dual endothelin-angiotensin receptor antagonist, reduced proteinuria in patients with FSGS. The efficacy and safety of longer-term treatment with sparsentan for FSGS are unknown.\nMETHODS: In this phase 3 trial, we enrolled patients with FSGS (without known secondary causes) who were 8 to 75 years of age; patients were randomly assigned to receive sparsentan or irbesartan (active control) for 108 weeks. The surrogate efficacy end point assessed at the prespecified interim analysis at 36 weeks was the FSGS partial remission of proteinuria end point (defined as a urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio of \u22641.5 [with protein and creatinine both measured in grams] and a >40% reduction in the ratio from baseline). The primary efficacy end point was the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) slope at the time of the final analysis. The change in eGFR from baseline to 4 weeks after the end of treatment (week 112) was a secondary end point. Safety was also evaluated.\nRESULTS: A total of 371 patients underwent randomization: 184 were assigned to receive sparsentan and 187 to receive irbesartan. At 36 weeks, the percentage of patients with partial remission of proteinuria was 42.0% in the sparsentan group and 26.0% in the irbesartan group (P\u2009=\u20090.009), a response that was sustained through 108 weeks. At the time of the final analysis at week 108, there were no significant between-group differences in the eGFR slope; the between-group difference in total slope (day 1 to week 108) was 0.3 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 of body-surface area per year (95% confidence interval [CI], -1.7 to 2.4), and the between-group difference in the slope from week 6 to week 108 (i.e., chronic slope) was 0.9 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 per year (95% CI, -1.3 to 3.0). The mean change in eGFR from baseline to week 112 was -10.4 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 with sparsentan and -12.1 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 with irbesartan (difference, 1.8 ml per minute per 1.73 m2; 95% CI, -1.4 to 4.9).

In this context, ET, via the endothelin receptor type A (ET<sub>A</sub>) activation, causes sustained vasoconstriction of the afferent arterioles that produces deleterious effects such as hyperfiltration, podocyte damage, proteinuria and, eventually, GFR decline. Therefore, endothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs) have been proposed as a therapeutic strategy to reduce proteinuria and slow the progression of kidney disease. Preclinical and clinical evidence has revealed that the administration of ERAs reduces kidney fibrosis, inflammation and proteinuria. Currently, the efficacy of many ERAs to treat kidney disease is being tested in randomized controlled trials; however, some of these, such as avosentan and atrasentan, were not commercialized due to the adverse events related to their use. Therefore, to take advantage of the protective properties of the ERAs, the use of ET<sub>A</sub> receptor-specific antagonists and/or combining them with sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) has been proposed to prevent oedemas, the main ERAs-related deleterious effect. The use of a dual angiotensin-II type 1/endothelin receptor blocker (sparsentan) is also being evaluated to treat kidney disease. Here, we reviewed the main ERAs developed and the preclinical and clinical evidence of their kidney-protective effects. Additionally, we provided an overview of new strategies that have been proposed to integrate ERAs in kidney disease treatment.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35224732": "BACKGROUND: Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) can be separated into primary, genetic or secondary causes. Primary disease results in nephrotic syndrome while genetic and secondary forms may be associated with asymptomatic proteinuria or with nephrotic syndrome. Overall only about 20% of patients with FSGS experience a partial or complete remission of nephrotic syndrome with treatment. FSGS progresses to kidney failure in about half of the cases. This is an update of a review first published in 2008.\nOBJECTIVES: To assess the benefits and harms of immunosuppressive and non-immunosuppressive treatment regimens in adults with FSGS.\nSEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Kidney and Transplant Register of Studies to 21 June 2021 through contact with the Information Specialist using search terms relevant to this review. Studies in the Register are identified through searches of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE, conference proceedings, the International Clinical Trials Register (ICTRP) Search Portal and ClinicalTrials.gov.\nSELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs of any intervention for FSGS in adults were included. Studies comparing different types, routes, frequencies, and duration of immunosuppressive agents and non-immunosuppressive agents were assessed.\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: At least two authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. Statistical analyses were performed using the random-effects model and results were expressed as a risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes, or mean difference (MD) for continuous data with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Confidence in the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach.\nMAIN RESULTS: Fifteen studies (560 participants) were included. No studies specifically evaluating corticosteroids compared with placebo or supportive therapy were identified. Studies evaluated participants with steroid-resistant FSGS. Five studies (240 participants) compared cyclosporin with or without prednisone with different comparators (no specific treatment, prednisone, methylprednisolone, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), dexamethasone). Three small studies compared monoclonal antibodies (adalimumab, fresolimumab) with other agents or placebo. Six single small studies compared rituximab with tacrolimus, cyclosporin plus valsartan with cyclosporin alone, MMF with prednisone, chlorambucil plus methylprednisolone and prednisone with no specific treatment, different regimens of dexamethasone and CCX140-B (an antagonist of the chemokine receptor CCR2) with placebo. The final study (109 participants) compared sparsentan, a dual inhibitor of endothelin Type A receptor and of the angiotensin II Type 1 receptor, with irbesartan. In the risk of bias assessment, seven and five studies were at low risk of bias for sequence generation and allocation concealment, respectively. Four studies were at low risk of performance bias and 14 studies were at low risk of detection bias. Thirteen, six and five studies were at low risk of attrition bias, reporting bias and other bias, respectively. Of five studies evaluating cyclosporin, four could be included in our meta-analyses (231 participants). Cyclosporin with or without prednisone compared with different comparators may increase the likelihood of complete remission (RR 2.31, 95% CI 1.13 to 4.73; I\u00b2 = 1%; low certainty evidence) and of complete or partial remission (RR 1.64, 95% CI 1.10 to 2.44; I\u00b2 = 19%) but not of partial remission (RR 1.36, 95% CI 0.78 to 2.39, I\u00b2 = 22%). In Individual studies, cyclosporin with prednisone versus prednisone may increase the likelihood of partial (49 participants: RR 7.96, 95% CI 1.09 to 58.15) or complete or partial remission (49 participants: RR 8.85, 95% CI 1.22 to 63.92) but not of complete remission. The remaining individual comparisons may make little or no difference to the likelihood of complete remission, partial remission or complete or partial remission compared with no treatment, methylprednisolone, MMF, or dexamethasone. Individual study data and combined data showed that cyclosporin may make little or no difference to the outcomes of chronic kidney disease or kidney failure. It is uncertain whether cyclosporin compared with these comparators in individual or combined analyses makes any difference to the outcomes of hypertension or infection. MMF compared with prednisone may make little or no difference to the likelihood of complete remission (33 participants: RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.88; low certainty evidence), partial remission, complete or partial remission, glomerular filtration rate, or infection. It is uncertain whether other interventions make any difference to outcomes as the certainty of the evidence is very low. It is uncertain whether sparsentan reduces proteinuria to a greater extent than irbesartan.\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: No RCTs, which evaluated corticosteroids, were identified although the KDIGO guidelines recommend corticosteroids as the first treatment for adults with FSGS. The studies identified included participants with steroid-resistant FSGS. Treatment with cyclosporin for at least six months was more likely to achieve complete remission of proteinuria compared with other treatments but there was considerable imprecision due to few studies and small participant numbers.

Here, we report kidney function and outcomes over 110 weeks from the double-blind final analysis.\nMETHODS: PROTECT, a double-blind, randomised, active-controlled, phase 3 study, was done across 134 clinical practice sites in 18 countries throughout the Americas, Asia, and Europe. Patients aged 18 years or older with biopsy-proven primary IgA nephropathy and proteinuria of at least 1\u00b70 g per day despite maximised renin-angiotensin system inhibition for at least 12 weeks were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive sparsentan (target dose 400 mg oral sparsentan once daily) or irbesartan (target dose 300 mg oral irbesartan once daily) based on a permuted-block randomisation method.

The significant reduction in proteinuria at 36 weeks with sparsentan was maintained throughout the study period; at 110 weeks, proteinuria, as determined by the change from baseline in urine protein-to-creatinine ratio, was 40% lower in the sparsentan group than in the irbesartan group (-42\u00b78%, 95% CI -49\u00b78 to -35\u00b70, with sparsentan versus -4\u00b74%, -15\u00b78 to 8\u00b77, with irbesartan; geometric least-squares mean ratio 0\u00b760, 95% CI 0\u00b750 to 0\u00b772).

It is characterized by a defective glomerular basement membrane caused by mutations in type IV collagen genes COL4A3/A4/A5 which result in defective type IV collagen \u03b13, \u03b14, or \u03b15 chains, respectively. Alport syndrome has three different patterns of inheritance: X-linked, autosomal and digenic. In a study of CKD of unknown etiology type IV collagen gene mutations accounted for the majority of the cases of hereditary glomerulopathies which suggests that AS is often underrecognized. The natural history and prognosis in patients with AS is variable and is determined by genetics and environmental factors. At present, no preventive or curative therapies exist for AS. Current treatment includes the use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors which slow progression of kidney disease and prolong life expectancy. Ramipril was found in retrospective studies to delay the onset of ESKD and was recently demonstrated to be safe and effective in children and adolescents, supporting that early initiation of Renin Angiotensin Aldosterone System (RAAS) blockade is very important. Mineralocorticoid receptor blockers might be favorable for patients who develop \"aldosterone breakthrough.\" While the DAPA-CKD trial suggests a beneficial effect of SGLT2 inhibitors in CKD of non-metabolic origin, only a handful of patients had Alport in this cohort, and therefore conclusions can't be extrapolated for the treatment of AS with SGLT2 inhibitors. Advances in our understanding on the pathogenesis of Alport syndrome has culminated in the development of innovative therapeutic approaches that are currently under investigation.

Proper classification is critical, as it directly affects the therapy of choice. While glucocorticoids still play a central in inducing remission in primary forms, calcineurin inhibitors, mycophenolate mofetil, cyclophosphamide and rituximab (off label) are viable adjuncts/alternatives to reduce or replace glucocorticoids in case of side effects or contraindications. Since SGLT-2-inhibitors have shown renoprotective effects in non-diabetic patients and may help to reduce proteinuria, they should be considered in all (adult) patients with chronic kidney disease, including MCD and FSGS patients. In the near future, Sparsentan, an endothelin type A and angiotensin receptor blocker may be added to the growing arsenal of proteinuria-reducing agents, with a phase 3 trail expected to be completed in late 2022.

Children who fail to respond to corticosteroids in the first episode of nephrotic syndrome (initial resistance) or develop resistance after one or more responses to corticosteroids (delayed resistance) may be treated with immunosuppressive agents including calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) (cyclosporin or tacrolimus) and with non-immunosuppressive agents such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB). However, response to these agents is limited so newer agents are being assessed for efficacy.

Among children, who have achieved complete remission, tacrolimus compared with MMF may increase the number of children who maintain complete or partial response for 12 months (1 study, 60 children: RR 2.01, 95% CI 1.32 to 3.07) (low certainty evidence). Oral CPA with prednisone compared with prednisone alone may make little or no difference to the number who achieve complete remission (2 studies, 84 children: RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.87) (low certainty evidence). IV CPA compared with oral CPA (2 studies, 61 children: RR 1.58, 95% CI 0.65 to 3.85) and IV compared with oral CPA plus IV dexamethasone (1 study, 49 children: RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.96) may make little or no difference to the number who achieve complete remission (low certainty evidence). It is uncertain whether rituximab and cyclosporin compared with cyclosporin increases the likelihood of remission because the certainty of the evidence is very low. It is uncertain whether adalimumab or galactose compared with conservative therapy increases the likelihood of remission because the certainty of the evidence is very low. Two studies reported that ACEi may reduce proteinuria in children with SRNS. One study reported that the dual angiotensin II and endothelin Type A receptor antagonist, sparsentan, may reduce proteinuria more effectively than the angiotensin receptor blocker, irbesartan.\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: To date RCTs have demonstrated that CNIs may increase the likelihood of complete or partial remission compared with placebo/no treatment or CPA. For other regimens assessed, it remains uncertain whether the interventions alter outcomes because the certainty of the evidence is low. Further adequately powered, well designed RCTs are needed to evaluate other regimens for children with idiopathic SRNS.

The serum samples were tested for anti-clustered AChR Ab by cell-based assay (CBA), anti-MuSK Ab by ELISA, CBA and/or radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA). Clinical data were compared between anti-MuSK Ab-positive MG and double seronegative (AChR and MuSK) MG groups.\nRESULTS: After excluding non-MG and clustered AChR Ab-positive patients, we identified 89 patients as a cohort of AChR Ab-negative generalized MG. Anti-MuSK Ab was positive by ELISA in 22 (24.7%) patients. While CBA identified five additional anti-MuSK Ab-positive patients, the results of ELISA were mostly consistent with CBA and RIPA with Cohen's kappa of 0.80 and 0.90, respectively (p\u2009<\u20090.001). The most frequent differential diagnosis was motor neuron disease particularly of bulbar onset which showed remarkably overlapping clinical and electrophysiological features with MuSK MG at presentation.\nCONCLUSION: While confirming the highest sensitivity of CBA for detecting anti-MuSK Ab, our results highlight the clinical pitfalls in making a diagnosis of MuSK MG and may support a diagnostic utility of MuSK-ELISA in clinical practice.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37455510": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Myokines include cytokines secreted by muscle fibers, which are the final targets of myasthenia gravis (MG). This pilot study investigated whether myokine plasma concentrations are altered in patients with MG and assessed the association between the concentration of each myokine and disease severity.\nMETHODS: We compared the plasma concentrations of 15 myokines in 63 patients with acetylcholine receptor antibody (Ab)-positive MG and 14 with muscle-specific tyrosine kinase Ab-positive MG (MuSK MG) with those in 15 healthy controls. Plasma myokine concentrations were measured using a Luminex multiplex assay kit with magnetic beads that contained Abs for 15 myokines. Correlations between myokine concentration and clinical scale results were analyzed.\nRESULTS: The concentration of fractalkine in plasma was higher in MG (median [interquartile range]=419.6 [38.7-732.5] pg/mL) than in controls (158.5 [0.0-313.2] pg/mL, p=0.034). The leukemia inhibitory factor concentration was also found to be higher in MuSK MG (29.9 [8.7-40.1] pg/mL) than in healthy controls (7.6 [0.0-15.6] pg/mL, p=0.013).

In this report, we describe three patients with anti-muscle-specific kinase (MuSK) MG treated with HSCT.\nMETHODS: We included all patients who had undergone HSCT with anti-MuSK myasthenia gravis identified through the records of the Alberta Blood and Marrow Transplant Program. We collected demographic and clinical data including validated MG scales as well as questionnaire data.\nRESULTS: All 3 patients had severe disease (Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America score IVb-V) and were refractory to multiple treatments, including rituximab. All patients improved with no clinical manifestations or mild symptoms and remained as such for 2, 3.5, and 5.5\u00a0y. Adverse events ranged from treatable infections and transient dyspnea to persistent fatigue and premature menopause. The average worst Myasthenia Gravis Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL) scores improved from 14.7 before to 0.3 after HSCT.

The pathogenic antibodies mostly belong to the immunoglobulin subclass (Ig)G4, a feature which attributes them their specific properties and pathogenic profile. On the other hand, acetylcholine receptor (AChR) MG, the most prevalent form of MG, is characterized by immunoglobulin (Ig)G1 and IgG3 antibodies to the AChR. IgG4 class autoantibodies are impotent to fix complement and only weakly bind Fc-receptors expressed on immune cells and exert their pathogenicity via interfering with the interaction between their targets and binding partners (e.g. between MuSK and LRP4). Cardinal differences between AChR and MuSK-MG are the thymus involvement (not prominent in MuSK-MG), the distinct HLA alleles, and core immunopathological patterns of pathology in neuromuscular junction, structure, and function. In MuSK-MG, classical treatment options are usually less effective (e.g. IVIG) with the need for prolonged and high doses of steroids difficult to be tapered to control symptoms. Exceptional clinical response to plasmapheresis and rituximab has been particularly observed in these patients. Reduction of antibody titers follows the clinical efficacy of anti-CD20 therapies, a feature implying the role of short-lived plasma cells (SLPB) in autoantibody production. Novel therapeutic monoclonal against B cells at different stages of their maturation (like plasmablasts), or against molecules involved in B cell activation, represent promising therapeutic targets. A revolution in autoantibody-mediated diseases is pharmacological interference with the neonatal Fc receptor, leading to a rapid reduction of circulating IgGs (including autoantibodies), an approach already suitable for AChR-MG and promising for MuSK-MG. New precision medicine approaches involve Chimeric autoantibody receptor T (CAAR-T) cells that are engineered to target antigen-specific B cells in MuSK-MG and represent a milestone in the development of targeted immunotherapies. This review aims to provide a detailed update on the pathomechanisms involved in MuSK-MG (cellular and humoral aberrations), fostering the understanding of the latest indications regarding the efficacy of different treatment strategies.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35747537": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Muscle-specific kinase (MuSK) antibody-positive myasthenia gravis (MuSK + MG) is a form of MG with bulbar-predominant symptoms often resistant to conventional treatments.

This study compares EDX features of MuSK + MG with acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody-positive MG (AChR + MG) to discern whether any unique EDX pattern exists that can aid in clinical diagnosis.\nMETHODS: From January 1, 2010, through December 31, 2020, all patients with MuSK + MG at our institution were identified and randomly matched to an AChR + MG cohort in a 1:2 ratio based on sex, age at onset, and subsequently Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America (MGFA) clinical severity for a case-control study. Each patient's clinical profile, treatment, and EDX testing were summarized and analyzed.\nRESULTS: Twenty-two patients with MuSK + MG (18 female) and 44 patients with AChR + MG were studied. The average symptom duration at presentation was shorter in the MuSK + MG group (4.7 years) compared with AChR + MG (10.9 years). Myotonic discharges were rare in both groups but more frequently observed in patients with MuSK + MG (10%) identified in 5 muscles in 2 patients compared with AChR + MG (2%) noted in only 1 muscle in 1 patient. Patients with MuSK + MG more often had myopathic appearing motor unit potentials (MUPs) (41% vs 30%) compared with AChR + MG.

MMG predominates in women and weakness is typically more severe, with more frequent respiratory crises than non-MuSK myasthenia gravis. Patients with sub-acute bulbar, shoulder, and neck weakness pose unique challenges in terms of differential diagnosis and electrodiagnosis. Electrodiagnostic studies evaluating for disorders of neuromuscular transmission should focus on proximal limb and facial muscles, as well as clinically weak muscles. The response to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors is often disappointing. Long-term outcomes appear favorable though patients typically require more aggressive immunosuppression. Uncontrolled observations report encouraging results with rituximab in the treatment of refractory MMG.

The thymus histology is normal or only very mildly abnormal. Surprisingly, limb or intercostal muscle biopsies exhibit no reduction in AChR numbers or complement deposition.

In the current study we examined the proliferation, phenotype and cytokine production of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of MuSK-MG following a 3-day in vitro culture with or without tacrolimus. We determined that tacrolimus profoundly suppressed CD4 and CD8 T cell proliferation and significantly suppressed Th1 and Th17 responses, as demonstrated by a reduced frequency of IFN-\u03b3, IL-2, and IL-17 producing CD4 T cells and reduced frequencies of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2 producing CD8 T cells. Tacrolimus also inhibits pathogenic Th17 cells coproducing IL-17 and IFN-\u03b3. In addition, tacrolimus suppressed follicular T helper cell (Tfh) and regulatory T helper cell (Treg) subsets.

MuSK mediates the agrin-signaling pathway and also anchors the collagenic tail subunit (ColQ) of acetylcholinesterase (AChE). The exact molecular target of MuSK-immunoglobulin G (IgG), however, remains elusive. As acetylcholine receptor (AChR) deficiency is typically mild and as cholinesterase inhibitors are generally ineffective, we asked if MuSK-IgG interferes with binding of ColQ to MuSK.\nMETHODS: We used 3 assays: in vitro overlay of the human ColQ-tailed AChE to muscle sections of Colq-/- mice; in vitro plate-binding assay to quantitate binding of MuSK to ColQ and to LRP4; and passive transfer of MuSK-IgG to mice.\nRESULTS: The in vitro overlay assay revealed that MuSK-IgG blocks binding of ColQ to the neuromuscular junction. The in vitro plate-binding assay showed that MuSK-IgG exerts a dose-dependent block of MuSK binding to ColQ by but not to LRP4. Passive transfer of MuSK-IgG to mice reduced the size and density of ColQ to \u223c10% of controls and had a lesser effect on the size and density of AChR and MuSK.\nCONCLUSIONS: As lack of ColQ compromises agrin-mediated AChR clustering in Colq-/- mice, a similar mechanism may lead to AChR deficiency in MuSK-MG patients. Our experiments also predict partial AChE deficiency in MuSK-MG patients, but AChE is not reduced in biopsied NMJs. In humans, binding of ColQ to MuSK may be dispensable for clustering ColQ, but is required for facilitating AChR clustering.

Myasthenia gravis means \"grave (serious), muscle weakness.\" Although not completely curable, it can be managed well with a relatively high quality of life and expectancy. In myasthenia gravis, antibodies against the acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction interfere with regular muscular contraction. Although most commonly caused by antibodies to the acetylcholine receptor, antibodies against MuSK (muscle-specific kinase) protein can also weaken transmission at the neuromuscular junction. Muscle-specific tyrosine kinase myasthenia gravis (MuSK-Ab MG) is a rare subtype of myasthenia gravis with distinct pathogenesis and unique clinical features. Diagnosis can be challenging due to its atypical presentation as compared to seropositive myasthenia gravis. It responds inconsistently to steroids, but plasma exchange and immunosuppressive therapies have shown promising results.

These patients have a presentation that typically includes oculobulbar weakness, poorer response to cholinesterase inhibitors, and higher risk for acute clinical decompensation that necessitates plasma exchange. MuSK patients can require more aggressive maintenance immunosuppression earlier-on to maintain stability, often with rituximab.\nCASE REPORT: The authors report the case of a 45-year-old woman who presented with months of worsening hoarseness and exertional dyspnea. Laryngoscopy revealed limited abduction of vocal cords bilaterally as the source of the complaint. Examination revealed ophthalmoparesis and fatigable proximal muscle weakness. She was found to have elevated MuSK antibodies that, along with evidence of neuromuscular junction transmission defect on nerve conduction studies, confirmed the diagnosis of MuSK myasthenia gravis. She experienced no improvement with pyridostigmine and decompensated despite receiving oral steroids, requiring intubation. However, she dramatically improved with plasma exchange and has since been doing well on rituximab therapy.\nCONCLUSION: Dysphonia with hoarse quality secondary to vocal cord abduction paresis is a rare presentation of myasthenia gravis, as opposed to the typical flaccid dysarthria seen in bulbar myasthenia and should raise suspicion for MuSK antibody positivity. MuSK myasthenia gravis cases can be more refractory to treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors and are more likely to cause exacerbations and myasthenia crisis.

Anti-MuSK Abs are nearly always associated with generalized symptoms, with prevalent involvement of craniobulbar, cervical and respiratory muscles and with a striking preponderance in women. The typical course of MuSK-MG is acute onset, rapid progression, brittle course in the first years, early respiratory crises and unprovoked relapses in spite of high-dose immunosuppression. Patients often require long-term management with multiple immunosuppressive (IS) agents and many of them remain dependent on IS treatment. The majority of anti-MuSK Abs are of the non-complement-binding IgG4 subclass. We report the case of a Greek female MuSK-MG patient with typical phenotype but clearly atypical clinical course during 12 years of follow-up. The patient received only corticosteroid treatment for one year and showed mild and stable MG symptoms under no treatment for the rest of the observation period, except for postpartum mild and short-lived exacerbation.

The C-terminal domain of ColQ binds to MuSK, the muscle-specific receptor tyrosine kinase, that mediates a signal for acetylcholine receptor (AChR) clustering at the NMJ. ColQ also binds to heparan sulfate proteoglycans including perlecan. Congenital defects of ColQ cause endplate AChE deficiency. A single intravenous administration of adeno-associated virus serotype 8 (AAV8)-COLQ to Colq-/- mice rescued motor functions, synaptic transmission, and the ultrastructure of NMJ. We also injected AAV1-COLQ-IRES-EGFP to the left tibialis anterior and observed colocalization of AChE/ColQ at all the examined NMJs of the non-injected limbs. Additionally, injection of purified recombinant AChE/ColQ protein complex into gluteus maximus accumulated AChE in non-injected forelimbs. These observations suggest that the tissue-targeting signal of ColQ can be exploited to specifically deliver the transgene product to the target tissue. MuSK antibody-positive myasthenia gravis (MG) accounts for 5-15% of autoimmune MG. As AChR deficiency is typically mild and as cholinesterase inhibitors are generally ineffective or worsen myasthenic symptoms, we asked if the patient's MuSK-IgG interferes with binding of ColQ to MuSK. In vitro overlay of AChE/ColQ to muscle sections of Colq-/- mice revealed that MuSK-IgG blocks binding of ColQ to the NMJ. In vitro plate-binding of MuSK to ColQ disclosed that MuSK-IgG exerts a dose-dependent block of MuSK-ColQ interaction.

Although nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly used as antipyretics, they should be reserved for pain or chronic inflammatory conditions due to safety concerns. If we can safely achieve the same antipyretic effect using a higher dose (20 mg/kg) of paracetamol, NSAIDs may be avoided for treating fever. There is a paucity of literature comparing the antipyretic effect of mefenamic acid and high-dose paracetamol. We hypothesized that there would be no difference in the antipyretic effect of high-dose paracetamol and mefenamic acid. Methods In this randomized control trial, 165 febrile children were randomly allocated to one of the following three groups: standard-dose (15 mg/kg) paracetamol (SDPCM) as the control group and high-dose (20 mg/kg) paracetamol (HDPCM) and mefenamic acid (6 mg/kg) (MFN) as the intervention groups. The temperature was measured using a digital thermometer at the start of drug dosage and every 15 minutes until it reached normal. One-way between-group analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare outcome measures such as time for\u00a0temperature to reach normal, fall of temperature in 60 minutes, and time for the next fever. Post hoc analysis was performed to compare mean differences. Patients were monitored for adverse effects. Results Out of 165 enrolled patients, 159 were analyzed. The baseline demographic data were comparable among the groups. There was a statistically significant difference in the mean time taken for the temperature to reach normal (F-value (F) (2,156)=3.184, p<0.05) and the mean reduction in temperature at 60 minutes (F (2,156)=23.40, p<0.001) among the groups. The mean time for temperature to reach normal in the\u00a0SDPCM group (97.50\u00b126.60 minutes) was longer than that in the HDPCM\u00a0(85.09\u00b131.43 minutes) and MFN\u00a0(84.90\u00b130.42 minutes) groups. The decrease in temperature over 60 minutes was greater in the HDPCM (0.46\u00b0C\u00b10.19\u00b0C) and MFN (0.45\u00b0C\u00b10.11\u00b0C) groups than in the SDPCM (0.33\u00b0C\u00b10.10\u00b0C) group. The time to the next fever spike was shorter for the SDPCM\u00a0group (5.07\u00b12.66 hours) than for the HDPCM (7.20\u00b13.08 hours) and MFN (8.82\u00b13.83 hours) groups. Post hoc analysis demonstrated that high-dose paracetamol and mefenamic acid had similar and faster antipyretic effects than standard-dose paracetamol. Although the duration of action was found to be longer in the mefenamic acid group, the difference was not statistically significant. There were negligible adverse effects in the groups. Conclusion\u00a0 Standard-dose paracetamol (15 mg/kg/dose) had a slower and shorter antipyretic effect than high-dose paracetamol (20 mg/kg/dose) and mefenamic acid (6 mg/kg/dose). A single dose of high-dose paracetamol was safe and had a similar antipyretic effect as mefenamic acid. Mefenamic acid may be avoided as an antipyretic and spared for pain and anti-inflammatory indications. Multicentered double-blind clinical trials with larger sample sizes and comparisons of other NSAIDs will be required to confirm these findings.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35511631": "In infants and children, fever is very common in the emergency setting. The overall aim of the present publication was to overview guidance and provide an algorithm for use in the emergency setting as well as recommendations to inform parents for home care. To obtain consensus, a core steering committee drafted a management algorithm and general consensus was obtained by remote voting among experts. A number of common messages are found in current guidelines: management of fever depends on age, antipyretics are indicated only for discomfort; paracetamol or ibuprofen can be recommended; physical methods for lowering temperature are discouraged. A consensus algorithm is presented in which infants <28 days are considered separately, while those >28 days and <90 days are divided into those ill or well appearing. All infants <28 days with fever \u226537.5 \u00b0C should undergo complete work-up for sepsis, strongly considered to receive empirical antibiotics \u00b1 acyclovir, and be hospitalized. All infants (between 28 and 90 days) ill appearing should undergo diagnostic work-up for sepsis, receive empirical antibiotics, and be hospitalized. In well appearing infants, diagnostic work-up should be carried out to decide admission to hospital and administration of antibiotics. Specific recommendations are also given for home discharge that can be used to inform parents about the actions to take during home care in the attempt to reinforce existing guidelines. At present, physical examination and laboratory tests, along with best clinical judgement and postdischarge guidance following a defined algorithm, are the foundation of management of febrile children.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33912381": "Fever is one of the most common reasons for unwell children presenting to pharmacists and primary healthcare practitioners. Currently there are no guidelines for assessment and management of fever specifically for community and primary healthcare workers in the sub-Saharan Africa region. This multidisciplinary consensus guide was developed to assist pharmacists and primary healthcare workers in sub-Saharan Africa to risk stratify and manage children who present with fever, decide when to refer, and how to advise parents and caregivers. Fever is defined as body temperature \u2265\u00a037.5\u00a0\u00b0C and is a normal physiological response to illness that facilitates and accelerates recovery. Although it is often associated with self-limiting illness, it causes significant concern to both parents and attending healthcare workers. Clinical signs may be used by pharmacy staff and primary healthcare workers to determine level of distress and to distinguish between a child with fever who is at high risk of serious illness and who requires specific treatment, hospitalisation or specialist care, and those at low risk who could be managed conservatively at home. In children with warning signs, serious causes of fever that may need to be excluded include infections (including malaria), non-infective inflammatory conditions and malignancy. Simple febrile convulsions are not in themselves harmful, and are not necessarily indicative of serious infection. In the absence of illness requiring specific treatment, relief from distress is the primary indication for prescribing pharmacotherapy, and antipyretics should not be administered with the sole intention of reducing body temperature. Care must be taken not to overdose medications and clear instructions should be given to parents/caregivers on managing the child at home and when to seek further medical care.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9578327": "Entering both the old dispute (whether fever is adaptive or maladaptive) and its more recent modification (whether hypothermia is protective or detrimental in systemic inflammation), we suggest a new solution. We hypothesize that fever and hypothermia represent two different strategies of fighting systemic inflammation, each developed as an adaptive response to certain conditions, and each beneficial under these conditions. The antimicrobial and immunostimulating benefits of a high body temperature could be easily offset by its high energy cost. Fever, therefore, is protective only when there is no immediate threat of a substantial energy deficit. Hypothermia, on the other hand, constitutes a response aimed at energy conservation and, as such, is beneficial exactly under the conditions of a substantial energy deficit. The two thermoregulatory responses represent two complementary strategies of survival in systemic inflammation: fever ensures the active attack against the pathogen; hypothermia secures the defense of the host's vital systems. The importance of each response's contribution to the whole campaign depends on the severity of the pathogenic insult, premorbid pathology, and current conditions (stress, nutrition, ambient temperature, etc.).", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33738101": "Although fever is one of the main presenting symptoms of COVID-19 infection, little public attention has been given to fever as an evolved defense. Fever, the regulated increase in the body temperature, is part of the evolved systemic reaction to infection known as the acute phase response. The heat of fever augments the performance of immune cells, induces stress on pathogens and infected cells directly, and combines with other stressors to provide a nonspecific immune defense. Observational trials in humans suggest a survival benefit from fever, and randomized trials published before COVID-19 do not support fever reduction in patients with infection. Like public health measures that seem burdensome and excessive, fevers involve costly trade-offs but they can prevent infection from getting out of control. For infections with novel SARS-CoV-2, the precautionary principle applies: unless evidence suggests otherwise, we advise that fever should be allowed to run its course. Lay summary: For COVID-19, many public health organizations have advised treating fever with medicines such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Even though this is a common practice, lowering body temperature has not improved survival in laboratory animals or in patients with infections. Blocking fever can be harmful because fever, along with other sickness symptoms, evolved as a defense against infection. Fever works by causing more damage to pathogens and infected cells than it does to healthy cells in the body. During pandemic COVID-19, the benefits of allowing fever to occur probably outweigh its harms, for individuals and for the public at large.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21357332": "Fever in a child is one of the most common clinical symptoms managed by pediatricians and other health care providers and a frequent cause of parental concern. Many parents administer antipyretics even when there is minimal or no fever, because they are concerned that the child must maintain a \"normal\" temperature. Fever, however, is not the primary illness but is a physiologic mechanism that has beneficial effects in fighting infection. There is no evidence that fever itself worsens the course of an illness or that it causes long-term neurologic complications. Thus, the primary goal of treating the febrile child should be to improve the child's overall comfort rather than focus on the normalization of body temperature. When counseling the parents or caregivers of a febrile child, the general well-being of the child, the importance of monitoring activity, observing for signs of serious illness, encouraging appropriate fluid intake, and the safe storage of antipyretics should be emphasized. Current evidence suggests that there is no substantial difference in the safety and effectiveness of acetaminophen and ibuprofen in the care of a generally healthy child with fever. There is evidence that combining these 2 products is more effective than the use of a single agent alone; however, there are concerns that combined treatment may be more complicated and contribute to the unsafe use of these drugs. Pediatricians should also promote patient safety by advocating for simplified formulations, dosing instructions, and dosing devices.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22436665": "Fever is considered a key actor of innate immunity aimed to fight infection.

In contrast, high temperature in non-infectious intensive care patients is associated with higher mortality.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16617919": "Fever is a normal adaptation in response to a pyrogenic stimulus resulting in the generation of cytokines and prostaglandins. Fever differs from hyperpyrexia and hyperthermia associated with hot environs and pharmacological triggers. Typically, pyrogens are infectious organisms or their direct products (toxins). The body produces a wide array of pyrogenic cytokines such as interleukins (IL-1, IL-6), interferon, and tumor necrosis factor. Tissue trauma can trigger the febrile response, as can infectious organisms, certain medications, and blood products. The circumventricular organ system (CVOS) is neuronal tissues lying outside the blood-brain barrier that has a key role in initiating the communication sequence responsible for the synthesis of febrile prostaglandins. When pyrogenic cytokines are detected by the CVOS, prostaglandin synthesis, especially cyclooxygenase-dependent prostaglandin E2, is induced, activating the febrile response. Once the appropriate signal is received by the hypothalamus, autonomic, endocrine, and behavioral processes are activated until the hypothalamic set-point is reset downward as a consequence of a reduction in pyrogen content or antipyretic therapy, with subsequent heat loss. There is little evidence that fever facilitates recovery from disease or assists the immune system in mounting a response. Antipyretics are used commonly to decrease the distressing manifestations associated with fever.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35822579": "Fever is an abnormal increase in body temperature that occurs as part of a specific biologic response mediated and controlled by the central nervous system. Despite the fact that most fevers are viral in origin, approaching a febrile child is always a concern for any physician. There is still a significant gap between current practice and scientific evidence. According to research, we are at a crossroad, with strong research evidence accumulating over the last few decades supporting a positive role for fever and the ongoing pressures of current practice to lower body temperature. Despite the fact that most pediatricians agree that treating a febrile child with antipyretics is primarily for the relief of fever symptoms, many continue to prescribe antipyretics for any child with fever, ignoring important research messages. By prescribing antipyretics to children who are only mildly febrile, pediatricians may contribute to fever phobia. We give parents the impression that fever is harmful and that antipyresis is beneficial when we focus on treating the fever. The purpose of this review is to present the evidence that is currently available regarding the management of the febrile child.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2200377": "While understanding of the mechanisms of fever has progressed in recent years, much uncertainty remains as to whether fever in itself (as distinct from its cause) is beneficial or harmful, and what circumstances warrant antipyretic therapy. This review was designed to identify studies providing information on the effects of fever and of pharmacologic and physical therapy. Fever or analogous behavioral thermal upregulation apparently has positive effects on defense against infection in some animal models. Retrospective studies in humans suggest that failure to mount a febrile response is associated with poor outcome in certain infections but do not establish a causal relationship. Induction of fever apparently had therapeutic value in infections such as syphilis before specific antimicrobials were developed. Fever may have deleterious effects in the context of borderline cardiovascular or neurologic function or pregnancy, but data in most instances cannot separate effects of fever per se from that of underlying disease. Antipyretic drugs are effective in diminishing fever, but they have significant side effects and may suppress signs of ongoing infection. Physical cooling is important when physiologic thermoregulatory mechanisms are overwhelmed, but may sometimes increase discomfort and metabolic stress in fever. Antipyretic therapy should not be instituted routinely for every febrile episode but should be based on evaluation of relative risks in the individual case and reassessed if anticipated benefits are not achieved.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12856055": "Antipyretics, including acetaminophen (paracetamol), are prescribed commonly in children with pyrexia, despite minimal evidence of a clinical benefit. A literature review was performed by searching Medline and the Cochrane databases for research papers on the efficacy of paracetamol in febrile illnesses in children and adverse outcomes related to the use of paracetamol. No studies showed any clear benefit for the use of paracetamol in therapeutic doses in febrile children with viral or bacterial infections or with malaria. Some studies suggested that fever may have a beneficial role in infection, although no definitive prospective studies in children have been done to prove this. The use of paracetamol in therapeutic doses generally is safe, although hepatotoxicity has occurred with recommended dosages in children. In developing countries where malnutrition is common, data on the safety of paracetamol are lacking. The cost of paracetamol for poor families is substantial. No evidence shows that it is beneficial to treat febrile children with paracetamol. Treatment should be given only to children who are in obvious discomfort and those with conditions known to be painful. The role of paracetamol in children with severe malaria or sepsis and in malnourished, febrile children needs to be clarified.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34920276": "INTRODUCTION: There has been limited development and uptake of machine-learning methods to automate data extraction for literature-based assessments. Although advanced extraction approaches have been applied to some clinical research reviews, existing methods are not well suited for addressing toxicology or environmental health questions due to unique data needs to support reviews in these fields.\nOBJECTIVES: To develop and evaluate a flexible, web-based tool for semi-automated data extraction that: 1) makes data extraction predictions with user verification, 2) integrates token-level annotations, and 3) connects extracted entities to support hierarchical data extraction.\nMETHODS: Dextr was developed with Agile software methodology using a two-team approach. The development team outlined proposed features and coded the software. The advisory team guided developers and evaluated Dextr's performance on precision, recall, and extraction time by comparing a manual extraction workflow to a semi-automated extraction workflow using a dataset of 51 environmental health animal studies.\nRESULTS: The semi-automated workflow did not appear to affect precision rate (96.0% vs. 95.4% manual, p\u00a0=\u00a00.38), resulted in a small reduction in recall rate (91.8% vs. 97.0% manual, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01), and substantially reduced the median extraction time (436\u00a0s vs. 933\u00a0s per study manual, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) compared to a manual workflow.\nDISCUSSION: Dextr provides similar performance to manual extraction in terms of recall and precision and greatly reduces data extraction time. Unlike other tools, Dextr provides the ability to extract complex concepts (e.g., multiple experiments with various exposures and doses within a single study), properly connect the extracted elements within a study, and effectively limit the work required by researchers to generate machine-readable, annotated exports. The Dextr tool addresses data-extraction challenges associated with environmental health sciences literature with a simple user interface, incorporates the key capabilities of user verification and entity connecting, provides a platform for further automation developments, and has the potential to improve data extraction for literature reviews in this and other fields.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32856160": "The use of primary care electronic health records for research is abundant.

Duodenal intussusception is a relatively rare condition, usually caused by the presence of benign tumors, such as fibroadenomas, lipomas, papillomas, or sometimes with malignant neoplasms. We report a case of giant Brunner's gland hamartoma in the duodenum causing antiperistaltic intussusception in a 45-year-old female patient. The patient reported a 3-year history of chronic anemia, and this mass was detected incidentally by computed tomography (CT) during investigations for chronic anemia and weight loss. Pre-operative abdominal and pelvis contrast revealed a sausage-shaped intraluminal structure with alternating fat planes and vessels distended in the third part of the duodenum up to the first part of the duodenum.

Brunner's gland hamartoma commonly occurred in the duodenal bulb and exhibited a polypoid appearance, while Brunner's gland hyperplasia was primarily observed in the second portion of duodenum as a submucosal mass and was accompanied by symptoms more frequently than Brunner's gland hamartoma. The Brunner's glands in Brunner's gland proliferating lesions exhibited various morphologic characteristics, from normal-appearing glands to sclerotic glandular foci with atypia. Changes in MUC5 expression observed in both sclerotic glandular foci and dilated Brunner's glands suggest that they might share a common mechanism and are associated with gastric foveolar metaplasia.\nCONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that most Brunner's gland proliferating lesions are either hamartoma or hyperplasia, and that true neoplastic Brunner's gland proliferating lesions are very rare.

There is therefore a need for safe, effective non-hormonal therapy for relief of menopausal vasomotor symptoms (VMS).Areas covered: This narrative review summarizes the dataset accrued for fezolinetant, a neurokinin-3 receptor (NK3R) antagonist in clinical development for menopause-associated VMS.Expert opinion: Altered signaling in neuroendocrine circuits at menopause leads to VMS wherein NK3R activity plays a key role to modulate the thermoregulatory center in a manner conducive to triggering the 'hot flash' response. Thus, a new generation of NK3R antagonists has entered clinical development to specifically target the mechanistic basis of VMS. Fezolinetant is the most advanced NK3R antagonist in terms of stage of clinical development.

Data Sources: A literature search was conducted through PubMed using the following search terms: fezolinetant, ES259564, SKYLIGHT, vasomotor symptoms, and menopause. Study Selection and Data Extraction: Selected articles included those which described clinical studies of the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, safety, or tolerability of fezolinetant. Data Synthesis: Fezolinetant works by inhibiting neurokinin B from binding to its receptor in the hypothalamus, thereby decreasing the occurrence of vasomotor symptoms. Clinical trials have demonstrated fezolinetant is superior to placebo in decreasing the frequency and severity of vasomotor symptoms. Common adverse effects associated with the use of fezolinetant include headache and gastrointestinal disturbances, as well as elevations in liver transaminase levels. Conclusions: Clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause recommend hormone therapy as the most effective treatment option. Risks associated with hormone use may limit the use of this option in some patients. Neurokinin B inhibitors, like fezolinetant, target the physiologic cause of vasomotor symptoms.

Recent evidence strongly suggests a connection between neurokinin 3 (NK3) receptor signaling and VMS associated with menopause. The NK3 receptor antagonist fezolinetant is currently in phase 3 development for treatment of moderate to severe VMS associated with menopause. We investigated the pharmacological effects of repeated administration of fezolinetant on levels of sex hormones and gonadotropins, neuronal activity in the hypothalamus, and skin temperature as an index of hot flash-like symptoms in ovariectomized rats as a model of menopause. Ovariectomized rats exhibited several typical menopausal symptoms: hyperphagia, increased body weight, significantly decreased plasma estradiol levels, increased luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels, and significantly increased skin temperature. Increased c-Fos expression (an indirect marker of neuronal activity) in median preoptic nucleus (MnPO) hypothalamic neurons was also observed in ovariectomized rats. Repeated oral administration of fezolinetant (1-10\u00a0mg/kg, twice daily) for 1 week dose-dependently reduced plasma LH levels without affecting estradiol or FSH levels, inhibited the activation of MnPO neurons, and attenuated hot flash-like symptoms. In addition, fezolinetant dose-dependently reduced hyperphagia and weight gain in ovariectomized rats.

This is unfortunate, although it might be possible to assess certain domains of the MENQOL for their approximation to an interval score with the application of the Rasch Rating Scale Model, this will not support quality of life claims. A preferred approach would be to consider an alternative latent trait for quality of life in menopause, applying Rasch Measurement Theory (RMT), to develop a polytomous instrument that has the required measurement properties. The purpose of this commentary is to point out, as a number of previous commentaries have done, that this framework for creating assumption driven simulated modelled claims has no role in decisions for product assessment, access to formulary and pricing. This commentary expands upon these previous commentaries in placing RMT is the context of a needed paradigm shift to support the evolution of objective knowledge. This is critical if we are to understand, from the individual's perspective, not only an accurate assessment of the burden of menopause but to see this as part of an on-going research program that has to rely on fundamental measurement.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31916265": "Air pollution and climate change have a significant impact on human health and well-being and contribute to the onset and aggravation of allergic rhinitis and asthma among other chronic respiratory diseases. In Westernized countries, households have experienced a process of increasing insulation and individuals tend to spend most of their time indoors. These sequelae implicate a high exposure to indoor allergens (house dust mites, pets, molds, etc), tobacco smoke, and other pollutants, which have an impact on respiratory health. Outdoor air pollution derived from traffic and other human activities not only has a direct negative effect on human health but also enhances the allergenicity of some plants and contributes to global warming. Climate change modifies the availability and distribution of plant- and fungal-derived allergens and increases the frequency of extreme climate events. This review summarizes the effects of indoor air pollution, outdoor air pollution, and subsequent climate change on asthma and allergic rhinitis in children and adults and addresses the policy adjustments and lifestyle changes required to mitigate their deleterious effects.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32867076": "Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease characterized by variable airflow obstruction, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and airway inflammation. Evidence suggests that air pollution has a negative impact on asthma outcomes in both adult and pediatric populations. The aim of this review is to summarize the current knowledge on the effect of various outdoor and indoor pollutants on asthma outcomes, their burden on its management, as well as to highlight the measures that could result in improved asthma outcomes. Traffic-related air pollution, nitrogen dioxide and second-hand smoking (SHS) exposures represent significant risk factors for asthma development in children. Nevertheless, a causal relation between air pollution and development of adult asthma is not clearly established. Exposure to outdoor pollutants can induce asthma symptoms, exacerbations and decreases in lung function. Active tobacco smoking is associated with poorer asthma control, while exposure to SHS increases the risk of asthma exacerbations, respiratory symptoms and healthcare utilization. Other indoor pollutants such as heating sources and molds can also negatively impact the course of asthma. Global measures, that aim to reduce exposure to air pollutants, are highly needed in order to improve the outcomes and management of adult and pediatric asthma in addition to the existing guidelines.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37467498": "BACKGROUND: Angiotensinogen is the sole precursor of angiotensin peptides and has a key role in the pathogenesis of hypertension. Zilebesiran, an investigational RNA interference therapeutic agent with a prolonged duration of action, inhibits hepatic angiotensinogen synthesis.\nMETHODS: In this phase 1 study, patients with hypertension were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive either a single ascending subcutaneous dose of zilebesiran (10, 25, 50, 100, 200, 400, or 800 mg) or placebo and were followed for 24 weeks (Part A). Part B assessed the effect of the 800-mg dose of zilebesiran on blood pressure under low- or high-salt diet conditions, and Part E the effect of that dose when coadministered with irbesartan. End points included safety, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics, and the change from baseline in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, as measured by 24-hour ambulatory blood-pressure monitoring.\nRESULTS: Of 107 patients enrolled, 5 had mild, transient injection-site reactions. There were no reports of hypotension, hyperkalemia, or worsening of renal function resulting in medical intervention. In Part A, patients receiving zilebesiran had decreases in serum angiotensinogen levels that were correlated with the administered dose (r\u2009=\u2009-0.56 at week 8; 95% confidence interval, -0.69 to -0.39). Single doses of zilebesiran (\u2265200 mg) were associated with decreases in systolic blood pressure (>10 mm Hg) and diastolic blood pressure (>5 mm Hg) by week 8; these changes were consistent throughout the diurnal cycle and were sustained at 24 weeks. Results from Parts B and E were consistent with attenuation of the effect on blood pressure by a high-salt diet and with an augmented effect through coadministration with irbesartan, respectively.\nCONCLUSIONS: Dose-dependent decreases in serum angiotensinogen levels and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure were sustained for up to 24 weeks after a single subcutaneous dose of zilebesiran of 200 mg or more; mild injection-site reactions were observed.

A high proportion of hypertensive patients exhibit uncontrolled blood pressure (BP), associated with poor adherence, linked to pill burden and adverse effects. Novel pharmacological strategies are urgently needed to improve BP control. Dysregulation of the renin-angiotensin system increases BP through its primary effector, Ang II (angiotensin II), which results in tissue remodeling and end-organ damage. Silencing liver angiotensinogen (the sole source of Ang II) has been achieved using novel RNA therapeutics, including the antisense oligonucleotide, IONIS-AGT (angiotensinogen)-LR<sub>X</sub>, and the small-interfering RNA, zilebesiran. Conjugation to N-acetylgalactosamine enables targeted delivery to hepatocytes, where endosomal storage, slow leakage, and small-interfering RNA recycling (for zilebesiran) result in knockdown over several months. Indeed, zilebesiran has an impressive and durable effect on systolic BP, reduced by up to 20 mm Hg and sustained for 6 months after a single administration, likely due to its very effective knockdown of angiotensinogen, without causing acute kidney injury or hyperkalemia. By contrast, IONIS-AGT-LR<sub>X</sub> caused less knockdown and marginal effects on BP. Future studies should evaluate any loss of efficacy relating to antidrug antibodies, safety issues associated with long-term angiotensinogen suppression, and broader benefits, especially in the context of common comorbidities such as type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37897397": "INTRODUCTION: Hypertension is the main global risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Despite this, less than half of treated hypertensive patients are controlled. One reason for this is nonadherence, a major unmet need in hypertension pharmacotherapy. Small interfering RNA (small interfering ribonucleic acid) therapies inhibit protein translation, and, when linked to N-acetylgalactosamine, allow liver-specific targeting, and durability over several months. Targeted knockdown of hepatic angiotensinogen, the source of all angiotensins, offers a precision medicine approach.\nAREAS COVERED: This article describes the molecular basis for durability over months and the 24-h tonic target inhibition observed after one administration. We present an analysis of the published phase I trials using zilebesiran, a siRNA targeting hepatic angiotensinogen, which reduces blood pressure (BP) by up to 20\u2009mmHg, lasting 24\u2009weeks. Finally, we examine data evaluating reversibility of angiotensinogen knockdown and its relevance to the future clinical utility of zilebesiran.\nEXPERT OPINION: Further studies should assess safety, efficacy, and outcomes in larger, more broadly representative groups. An advantage of zilebesiran is the potential for bi-annual dosing, thereby reducing nonadherence and improving control rates. It may also reduce nighttime BP due to 24-h tonic control. The provision of adherence assessment services will maximize the clinical value of zilebesiran.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34757143": "Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are at increased risk of developing colorectal cancer (CRC), despite decreases in CRC incidence in recent years. Chronic inflammation is the driver of neoplastic progression, resulting in dysplastic precursor lesions that may arise in multiple areas of the colon through a process of field cancerization. Colitis-associated CRC shares many molecular similarities with sporadic CRC, and preclinical investigations have demonstrated a potential role for the microbiome in concert with the host immune system in the development of colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CAC). Some unique molecular differences occur in CAC, but their role in the pathogenesis and behavior of inflammation-associated cancers remains to be elucidated. Nonconventional types of dysplasia have been increasingly recognized, but their natural history is not well defined, and they have not been incorporated into surveillance algorithms. The concept of cumulative inflammatory burden highlights the importance of considering histologic inflammation over time as an important risk factor for CAC. Dysplasia is arguably the most important risk factor for developing CAC, and advances have been made in the endoscopic detection and removal of precancerous lesions, thereby deferring or avoiding surgical resection. Some of the agents used to treat IBD are chemopreventive. It is hoped that by gaining better control of the underlying inflammation with newer medications and better endoscopic detection and management, a more sophisticated appreciation of clinicopathologic risk factors, and growing awareness of the genetic, immunologic, and environmental causes of colitis- associated neoplasia, that colitis-associated colorectal neoplasia will become even more predictable and manageable in the coming years.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19596953": "Patients with long-standing ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease have an increased risk of developing colorectal cancer and patients with small intestinal Crohn's disease are at increased risk of small bowel adenocarcinoma. Colorectal cancer appearing on the ground of inflammatory bowel disease is the result of a process which is believed to begin from no dysplasia progressing to indefinite dysplasia, low-grade dysplasia, high-grade dysplasia and finally to invasive adenocarcinoma, although colorectal cancer can arise without proceeding through each of these steps. Ulcerative colitis patients with total proctocolectomy and ileal pouch anal-anastomosis have a rather low risk of dysplasia in the ileal pouch, although the anal transition zone should be monitored periodically, especially if chronic pouchitis is present with associated severe villous atrophy. Concerning the risk factors predisposing to colorectal cancer in the setting of ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease, it seems that the risk increases with longer duration and greater anatomic extent of colitis, the degree of inflammation, and the presence of primary sclerosing cholangitis and family history of colorectal cancer. Concerning the mechanisms of carcinogenesis, it is now well established that the molecular alterations responsible for sporadic colorectal cancer, namely chromosomal instability, microsatellite instability and hypermethylation, also play a role in colitis-associated colon carcinogenesis.

Risk factors that further increase the risk of IBD-related CRC include disease duration, extent and severity, the presence of inflammatory pseudopolyps, coexistent primary sclerosing cholangitis, and a family history of CRC. All major professional societies agree that IBD-CRC surveillance should occur more frequently than in the general population. Yet, guidelines and consensus statements differ on the surveillance schedule and preferred method of surveillance. Improved sensitivity to previously \"invisible\" flat dysplastic lesions using high definition and chromoendoscopy methods has resulted in many guidelines abandoning requirements for random untargeted biopsies of the colon. While colonic dysplasia remains a worrisome finding, and several clinical scenarios remain best addressed by total proctocolectomy due to concerns of synchronous undetected lesions and the unpredictable tempo of progression to malignancy, better detection techniques have also increased opportunities for endoscopic resection of dysplastic lesions that can be clearly delineated.

Although the exact cause of CRC is still elusive, recent studies have indicated microbial involvement in its etiology.

The evidence that support the role of E. coli in the etiology of CRC, through IBD, is not limited only to chronic inflammation. The growth of E. coli as an intracellular pathogen during IBD and CRC enable the bacteria to modulate the host cell cycle, induce DNA damage and accumulate mutations. These are some of the contributing factors behind the etiology of CRC. The present article considers the current status of the involvement of E. coli, through IBD, in the etiology of CRC.

To date, no known genetic basis has been identified to explain colorectal cancer predisposition in these inflammatory bowel diseases. Instead, it is assumed that chronic inflammation is what causes cancer. This is supported by the fact that colon cancer risk increases with longer duration of colitis, greater anatomic extent of colitis, the concomitant presence of other inflammatory manifestations such as primary sclerosing cholangitis, and the fact that certain drugs used to treat inflammation, such as 5-aminosalicylates and steroids, may prevent the development of colorectal cancer. The major carcinogenic pathways that lead to sporadic colorectal cancer, namely chromosomal instability, microsatellite instability, and hypermethylation, also occur in colitis-associated colorectal cancers. Unlike normal colonic mucosa, however, inflamed colonic mucosa demonstrates abnormalities in these molecular pathways even before any histological evidence of dysplasia or cancer. Whereas the reasons for this are unknown, oxidative stress likely plays a role. Reactive oxygen and nitrogen species produced by inflammatory cells can interact with key genes involved in carcinogenic pathways such as p53, DNA mismatch repair genes, and even DNA base excision-repair genes. Other factors such as NF-kappaB and cyclooxygenases may also contribute. Administering agents that cause colitis in healthy rodents or genetically engineered cancer-prone mice accelerates the development of colorectal cancer. Mice genetically prone to inflammatory bowel disease also develop colorectal cancer especially in the presence of bacterial colonization.

Moreover, it appears that colon cancers that do not develop as a complication of inflammatory bowel disease are also driven by inflammation, because it has been shown that regular use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) lowers the mortality from sporadic colon cancer and results in regression of adenomas in familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) patients, who inherit a mutation in the Apc gene. Colorectal cancer therefore represents a paradigm for the link between inflammation and cancer. Inflammation is driven by soluble factors, cytokines and chemokines, which can be produced by tumor cells themselves or, more often, by the cells recruited to the tumor microenvironment. Inflammatory cytokines and chemokines promote growth of tumor cells, perturb their differentiation, and support the survival of cancer cells. Tumor cells become addicted to inflammatory stroma, suggesting that the tumor microenvironment represents an attractive target for preventive and therapeutic strategies. Proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF\u03b1, IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2, or transcription factors that are required for signaling by these cytokines, including NF-\u03baB and STATs, are indeed emerging as potential targets for anticancer therapy. TNF\u03b1 antagonists are in phase I/II clinical trials and have been shown to be well tolerated in patients with solid tumors, and IL-1\u03b2 antagonists that ameliorate several inflammatory disorders characterized by excessive IL-1\u03b2 production, will likely follow.

In the current study, we determined the contribution of STAT3 to IBD across all tissues by examining DSS-induced colitis in mice that express only STAT3\u03b1 and in mice treated with TTI-101, a direct small-molecule inhibitor of both isoforms of STAT3.\nMETHODS: We examined mortality, weight loss, rectal bleeding, diarrhea, colon shortening, apoptosis of colonic CD4+ T-cells, and colon infiltration with IL-17-producing cells following 7-day administration of DSS (5%) to transgenic STAT3\u03b1 knock-in (STAT3\u03b2-deficient; \u0394\u03b2\u0394\u03b2) mice and wild-type (WT) littermate cage control mice.

Importantly, TTI-101 treatment of DSS-administered WT mice led to complete attenuation of each of the clinical manifestations and also led to increased apoptosis of colonic CD4+ T cells, reduced colon infiltration with IL-17-producing cells, and down-modulation of colon mRNA levels of STAT3-upregulated genes involved in inflammation, apoptosis resistance, and colorectal cancer metastases.\nCONCLUSIONS: Thus, small-molecule targeting of STAT3 may be of benefit in treating IBD and preventing IBD-associated colorectal cancer.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30386335": "Patients with inflammatory bowel disease have an increased risk of developing colorectal cancer, and this risk is related to disease duration, extent, and cumulative inflammation burden.

In this review, we discuss the evolutionary dynamics of pre-neoplastic clones in colitis with a focus on how measuring their evolutionary trajectories could deliver a powerful way to predict future cancer occurrence. Measurements of somatic evolution require an interdisciplinary approach that combines quantitative measurement of the genotype, phenotype and the microenvironment of somatic cells-paying particular attention to spatial heterogeneity across the colon-together with mathematical modeling to interpret these data within an evolutionary framework.

This review aims to elucidate the role of these signaling pathways in the pathogenesis of colitis-associated CRC using evidence-based approaches.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29875879": "BACKGROUND: Active demethylation of 5-methyl-2'-deoxycytidine (5-mdC) in DNA occurs by oxidation to 5-(hydroxymethyl)-2'-deoxycytidine (5-hmdC) and further oxidation to 5-formyl-2'-deoxycytidine (5-fdC) and 5-carboxy-2'-deoxycytidine (5-cadC), and is carried out by enzymes of the ten-eleven translocation family (TETs 1, 2, 3). Decreased level of epigenetic DNA modifications in cancer tissue may be a consequence of reduced activity/expression of TET proteins. To determine the role of epigenetic DNA modifications in colon cancer development, we analyzed their levels in normal colon and various colonic pathologies. Moreover, we determined the expressions of TETs at mRNA and protein level.The study included material from patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), benign polyps (AD), and colorectal cancer (CRC). The levels of epigenetic DNA modifications and 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG) in examined tissues were determined by means of isotope-dilution automated online two-dimensional ultraperformance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (2D-UPLC-MS/MS). The expressions of TET mRNA were measured with RT-qPCR, and the expressions of TET proteins were determined immunohistochemically.\nRESULTS: IBD was characterized by the highest level of 8-oxodG among all analyzed tissues, as well as by a decrease in 5-hmdC and 5-mdC levels (at a midrange between normal colon and CRC). AD had the lowest levels of 5-hmdC and 5-mdC of all examined tissues and showed an increase in 8-oxodG and 5-(hydroxymethyl)-2'-deoxyuridine (5-hmdU) levels. CRC was characterized by lower levels of 5-hmdC and 5-mdC, the lowest level of 5-fdC among all analyzed tissues, and relatively high content of 5-cadC. The expression of TET1 mRNA in CRC and AD was significantly weaker than in IBD and normal colon. Furthermore, CRC and AD showed significantly lower levels of TET2 and AID mRNA than normal colonic tissue.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that a complex relationship between aberrant pattern of DNA epigenetic modification and cancer development does not depend solely on the transcriptional status of TET proteins, but also on the characteristics of premalignant/malignant cells. This study showed for the first time that the examined colonic pathologies had their unique epigenetic marks, distinguishing them from each other, as well as from normal colonic tissue. A decrease in 5-fdC level may be a characteristic feature of largely undifferentiated cancer cells.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21669488": "Endogenous formation of N-nitroso compounds (NOCs), which are known animal carcinogens, could contribute to human carcinogenesis but definitive evidence is still lacking. To investigate the relevance of NOCs in human colorectal cancer (CRC) development, we analyzed whole genome gene expression modifications in human colon biopsies in relation to fecal NOC exposure. We had a particular interest in patients suffering from intestinal inflammation as this may stimulate endogenous NOC formation, and consequently predispose to CRC risk. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients diagnosed with ulcerative colitis and irritable bowel syndrome patients without inflammation, serving as controls, were therefore recruited. Fecal NOC were demonstrated in the majority of subjects. By associating gene expression levels of all subjects to fecal NOC levels, we identified a NOC exposure-associated transcriptomic response that suggests that physiological NOC concentrations may potentially induce genotoxic responses and chromatin modifications in human colon tissue, both of which are linked to carcinogenicity. In a network analysis, chromatin modifications were linked to 11 significantly modulated histone genes, pointing towards a possible epigenetic mechanism that may be relevant in comprehending NOC-induced carcinogenesis. In addition, pro-inflammatory transcriptomic modifications were identified in visually non-inflamed regions of the IBD colon. However, fecal NOC levels were slightly but not significantly increased in IBD patients, suggesting that inflammation did not strongly stimulate NOC formation. We conclude that NOC exposure is associated with gene expression modifications in the human colon that may suggest a potential role of these compounds in CRC development.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24621115": "Patients with inflammatory bowel disease are at an increased risk for the development of colorectal cancer. However, the magnitude of this risk may not be as high as earlier studies have suggested. This shift in risk may be a result of changes in quality of analyses, aging cohorts, or may indeed represent true declines in the risk of cancer as a result of improvements in medical therapy and surveillance programs. The best surveillance practices for colorectal cancer screening in patients with inflammatory bowel disease remains unclear. The finding of dysplasia on colonoscopy in these patients warrants multi-disciplinary consultation between endoscopist, pathologist, and patient. At present, major organizations offer guidelines for surveillance interval, as well as when surgical consultation is advised. Moreover, newer endoscopic technologies have been developed and their incorporation into dysplasia surveillance programs continues to evolve.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21088413": "Patients with long-term inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's colonic disease (CD) have an increased risk of colorectal carcinoma (CRC). Eaden's meta-analysis has shown that the risk for CRC in UC patients is 2% at 10 years, 8% at 20 years and 18% at 30 years of disease duration. It is now accepted that the risk of colorectal cancer is equivalent in both (UC and CD) conditions. Duration of disease is recognized to be the most important risk factor for CRC development. Extent of disease in another major risk factor. Most cancers arise in patients with extensive disease, which is generally defined as extension of inflammation beyond the hepatic flexure. It was demonstrated that proctitis and proctosigmoiditis posed no increased risk for patients with UC. Recent data from case control studies suggests that greater degrees of colonoscopic or histologically active inflammation are associated with an increased risk of CRC. Recently, it has been proven that shortened tubular colon, colonic stricture and postinflammatory polyps should be considered strong risk factors for CRC development. Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) in patients with UC is associated with substantial risk of CRC. Screening colonoscopy should be performed in patients with UC after 8-10 years of disease. The interval between surveillance examinations is dependent on each individual's personal risk factors. In patients with a previous history of PSC, ongoing active inflammation, previous history of dysplasia or strictures, and strong family history of bowel cancer, annual surveillance is recommended. Colectomy is strictly recommended for patients who were diagnosed with flat high-grade dysplasia (HGD) or CRC and where the diagnosis was confirmed by expert gastrointestinal pathologists. In patients with a biopsy specimen considered indefinite for dysplasia, guidelines suggest colonoscopy between 3 and 12 months. Multifocal low-grade dysplasia (LGD) is a stronger indication for colectomy. The optimal colonoscopic surveillance interval for patients who were diagnosed with a flat LGD is still unknown, but 3-6 months is often recommended. Chemopreventive agents should be used to minimize the risk of developing dysplasia or CRC in IBD patients.

Colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CAC) is a subtype of CRC associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). It is well known that individuals with IBD have a 2-3 times higher risk of developing CRC than those who do not, rendering CAC a major cause of death in this group. Although the etiology and pathogenesis of CAC are incompletely understood, animal models of chronic inflammation and human cohort data indicate that changes in the intestinal environment, including host response dysregulation and gut microbiota perturbations, may contribute to the development of CAC. Genomic alterations are a hallmark of CAC, with patterns that are distinct from those in sporadic CRC. The discovery of the biological changes that underlie the development of CAC is ongoing; however, current data suggest that chronic inflammation in IBD increases the risk of developing CAC.

Here, we found that Elf4 -/- mice developed colon tumors with 3 cycles of dextran sulfate sodium salt (DSS) treatment alone. We further showed that ELF4 suppression was prevalent in both patients with UC and DSS-induced mice models, and this suppression was caused by promoter region methylation. ELF4, upon PARylation by PARP1, transcriptionally regulated multiple DNA damage repair machinery components. Consistently, ELF4 deficiency leads to more severe DNA damage both in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo. Oral administration of montmorillonite powder can prevent the reduction of ELF4 in DSS-induced colitis models and lower the risk of colon tumor development during azoxymethane (AOM) and DSS induced colitis-associated cancer (CAC).

Several models have been developed to explain the development of CAC, particularly the \"field cancerization\" model, which proposes that chronic inflammation accelerates mutagenesis and selects for the clonal expansion of phenotypically normal, pro-tumorigenic cells. In contrast, the \"Big Bang\" model posits that tumorigenic clones with multiple driver gene mutations emerge spontaneously.

Although IBD-associated colorectal cancer (IBD-CRC) accounts for only 1-2% of all cases of colorectal cancer, IBD with colon involvement is among the top three high-risk conditions for colorectal cancer. Today, colorectal cancer accounts for approximately 10-15% of all deaths among IBD patients. Indeed, patients with IBD colitis are six times more likely to develop colorectal cancer than the general population and have a higher frequency of multiple synchronous colorectal cancers. Since IBD-CRC was first described in 1925, the colon remains the primary site of neoplasms in IBD patients today. Ulcerative colitis-associated colorectal cancer is most common in the rectum and sigmoid colon, whereas Crohn's disease-associated colorectal cancer is evenly distributed between the different colon segments. Chemoprevention of colorectal cancer remains an important goal, and colonoscopy surveillance programs are critical to early detection in these patients. Newer methods, such as chromoendoscopy, are currently being investigated as complementary techniques to enhance early detection of dysplasia and cancer in this high-risk population. We present a comprehensive review of the relationship between inflammatory bowel disease and colorectal cancer. Major themes covered include risk factors for IBD-CRC and the molecular pathobiology of progression from dysplasia to cancer, endoscopic surveillance and new methods for early detection of dysplasia, approaches to prevention of IBD-CRC, and current recommendations and controversies regarding the treatment of dysplasia. In particular, disagreement has arisen over optimal management of low-grade dysplasia, with some IBD experts now advocating close colonoscopic surveillance of patients with low-grade dysplasia rather then total colectomy.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12950413": "Although colorectal cancer (CRC), complicating ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, only accounts for 1-2% of all cases of CRC in the general population, it is considered a serious complication of the disease and accounts for approximately 15% of all deaths in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. The magnitude of the risk was found to differ, even in population-based studies. Recent figures suggest that the risk of colon cancer for people with IBD increases by 0.5-1.0% yearly, 8-10 years after diagnosis. The magnitude of CRC risk increases with early age at IBD diagnosis, longer duration of symptoms, and extent of the disease, with pancolitis having a more severe inflammation burden and risk of the dysplasia-carcinoma cascade. Considering the chronic nature of the disease, it is remarkable that there is such a low incidence of CRC in some of the population-based studies, and possible explanations have to be investigated. One possible cancer-protective factor could be treatment with 5-aminosalicylic acid preparations (5-ASAs). Adenocarcinoma of the small bowel is extremely rare, compared with adenocarcinoma of the large bowel. Although only few small bowel cancers have been reported in Crohn's disease, the number was significantly increased in relation to the expected number.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18200660": "Patients with long-standing inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have an increased risk of developing colorectal cancer (CRC). Many of the molecular alterations responsible for sporadic colorectal cancer, namely chromosomal instability, microsatellite instability, and hypermethylation, also play a role in colitis-associated colon carcinogenesis. Colon cancer risk in inflammatory bowel disease increases with longer duration of colitis, greater anatomic extent of colitis, the presence of primary sclerosing cholangitis, family history of CRC and degree of inflammation of the bowel. Chemoprevention includes aminosalicylates, ursodeoxycholic acid, and possibly folic acid and statins. To reduce CRC mortality in IBD, colonoscopic surveillance with random biopsies remains the major way to detect early mucosal dysplasia. When dysplasia is confirmed, proctocolectomy is considered for these patients. Patients with small intestinal Crohn's disease are at increased risk of small bowel adenocarcinoma. Ulcerative colitis patients with total proctocolectomy and ileal pouch anal-anastomosis have a rather low risk of dysplasia in the ileal pouch, but the anal transition zone should be monitored periodically.

We studied the prevalence of malignancy in the relatives of 251 IBD patients [198 ulcerative colitis (UC); 53 Crohn's disease of the colon (CDC)] and 251 orthopedic patients (ORTHO) as controls. In all patients (UC, CDC) as well as in controls (ORTHO) the prevalence of colon, extracolic digestive and extradigestive malignant tumors in the first-degree relatives was evaluated.

However, the impact of comorbidities such as liver disease, obesity, diabetes, chronic lung, heart, and renal disease, and psychiatric illness on the risk of IBD-CRC remains unclear. We evaluated the effect of these comorbidities on the risk of IBD-CRC. Methods A retrospective review from 2009 to 2014 was conducted using the National Inpatient Sample data for adults 18 years and older. Patients with IBD (360,892), of whom 2,831 had CRC were identified using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes (ICD-9). Data on comorbidities were also obtained. Adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and confidence intervals (CI) were computed via logistic regression to evaluate the effect of comorbidities on the risk of IBD-CRC; the p-value was set at <0.05. Results The mean age of IBD patients in this study was 52.36\u00b10.03. A majority of the patients with IBD-CRC\u00a0were white and were significantly older compared to those without cancer (60 vs 52 years, p<0.05). The risk of colon cancer in IBD was increased by having a non-cholestatic liver disease (aOR 1.51, CI 1.23-1.86, p<0.01). Also, patients younger than 50 years with liver disease were at an increased risk of IBD-associated colon cancer in comparison to older patients (aOR 1.83 vs 1.34, p<0.05). Notably, diabetes, chronic pulmonary disease, renal failure, psychiatric illnesses, and rheumatoid diseases, were inversely associated with the risk of IBD-CRC (p<0.05). After stratifying by IBD subtypes, non-cholestatic liver disease was still independently associated with a higher risk for colon cancer in patients with ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease (ulcerative colitis: aOR 1.43, CI 1.08-1.89; Crohn's disease: aOR 1.46, CI 1.10-2.00).

Although most of the molecular alterations reported in sporadic CRC have also been observed in colitis-associated CRC, they do not occur at the same timing and frequency, indicating a different pathophysiology. In particular, recent work highlighted the importance of chronic mucosal inflammation as a key factor favouring colorectal carcinogenesis in these patients. This may also be one of the reasons explaining the role of 5-aminosalicylates as chemopreventive agents for CRC in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients with colonic involvement. Beside chemoprevention, colonoscopic screening and surveillance have been shown to be the cornerstone for CRC prevention and early detection in this particular patients' population. Periodic surveillance colonoscopy to detect dysplasia has been shown to decrease the mortality attributed to CRC. More recently, progress in imaging techniques increased our ability to identify dysplasia, and should probably now be considered to be an integral part of surveillance colonoscopy. In the future, further improvement of our knowledge of CRC biology, refinement of imaging techniques, as well as molecular discovery (e.g. identification of specific mutations in stool DNA extracts), might lead to develop more accurate diagnostic strategies to reduce the morbidity and mortality related to CRC in patients with ulcerative colitis or colonic Crohn's disease.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27573894": "Colorectal cancers (CRC) are known to be related to inflammatory conditions, and inflammatory bowel diseases increase the relative risk for developing CRC.

To visualize its distribution in the intestinal mucosa and to understand better its possible role in the induction and promotion of inflammatory bowel disease, expression of the IL-8 gene was analyzed in resected bowel segments of 14 patients with active Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. In situ hybridization with IL-8 anti-sense RNA probes revealed strong and specific signals in the histologically affected mucosa. The number of cells expressing IL-8 gene correlated with the histological grade of active inflammation. In accordance with the characteristic histological signs of active disease, IL-8-expressing cells were diffusely distributed over the entire affected mucosa in patients with ulcerative colitis, whereas in patients with Crohn's disease, IL-8-expressing cells showed a focal distribution pattern. Cells expressing IL-8 were mainly located at the base of ulcers, in inflammatory exudates on mucosal surfaces, in crypt abscesses, and at the border of fistulae. Analysis of semi-serial sections pointed to macrophages, neutrophils, and epithelial cells as possible sources of this cytokine in active inflammatory bowel disease. We consistently failed to detect IL-8 messenger RNA in the mucosa of uninvolved bowel segments and in normal-appearing control mucosa of patients with colon cancer. In contrast, tissue specimens from two patients with acute appendicitis displayed IL-8-expressing cells in the mucosa.

The glass slides of any case, including clinical and endoscopic data, were digitalized and uploaded on the E-learning platform. All the digital slides were grouped in 54 diagnostic \"blocks\". Blinded histopathological evaluation on all the digital slides was performed by 20 gastrointestinal pathologists. Closed-ended questions about (1) the occurrence of IBD; (2) the classification of IBD (as UC or CD); (3) the presence of active versus quiescent disease; (4) the presence of dysplasia; (5) the possible association of dysplasia with the sites of disease (dysplasia-associated lesion or mass-DALM vs adenoma-like mass-ALM); (6) the grading of dysplasia according to the ECCO guidelines (negative, indefinite, low grade, high grade categories) and (7) the presence of associated serrated features, were proposed in each case. Inter-observer agreement was evaluated by mean agreement percentage and kappa statistic, when suitable.\nRESULTS: The diagnosis of IBD was confirmed in 19 of 20 patients, 17 of 19 being classified as UC, 2 as CD. The mean interobserver agreement percentages about (1) the evidence of IBD, (2) the presence of either UC or CD and (3) the activity grading resulted to be 80%, 69% and 86%, respectively. Dysplasia was detected in 8/20 patients, with moderate agreement between pathologists (mean 72%, k 0.48). Particularly, low grade dysplasia was found in 13 biopsies (combined k 0.38), whereas high grade dysplasia in 8 (combined k 0.47).

Since that time considerable progress has been made in basic research addressing CM structure and functions. Human CM is formed by two distinct layers composed of gel-forming glycosylated mucins that are permanently secreted by goblet cells of the colonic epithelium. The inner layer is dense and impenetrable for bacteria, whereas the loose outer layer provides a habitat for abundant commensal microbiota. Mucus barrier integrity is essential for preventing bacterial contact with the mucosal epithelium and maintaining homeostasis in the gut, but it can be impaired by a variety of factors, including CM-damaging switch of commensal bacteria to mucin glycan consumption due to dietary fiber deficiency. It is proven that impairments in CM structure and function can lead to colonic barrier deterioration that opens direct bacterial access to the epithelium. Bacteria-induced damage dysregulates epithelial proliferation and causes mucosal inflammatory responses that may expand to the loosened CM and eventually result in severe disorders, including colitis and neoplastic growth. Recently described formation of bacterial biofilms within the inner CM layer was shown to be associated with both inflammation and cancer.

However, despite adoption of colonoscopic surveillance programs by many clinicians, we have noted a pattern of continued referrals for inflammatory bowel disease-associated malignancy. This study was undertaken in an effort to characterize this cohort of patients.\nMETHODS: We reviewed the operative records of a large metropolitan colorectal practice from 1983 to 1995. During this period 40 large-bowel resections were performed for patients with documented inflammatory bowel disease and concomitant carcinoma. A retrospective analysis was conducted with emphasis on clinical presentation, pathologic description, and most recent follow-up.\nRESULTS: Mean age at the time of diagnosis of cancer was 48 years with an average inflammatory bowel disease duration of 19 years. Seven patients had documented inflammatory bowel disease for less than eight years before their cancer diagnosis. Carcinomas were identified preoperatively by colonoscopy in 92 percent of patients. One-half of these patients had the colonoscopy to investigate a recent change in inflammatory bowel disease symptoms or signs, whereas the other half underwent endoscopy as routine surveillance. For the remaining 8 percent of patients, operated on for worsening symptoms, the carcinoma was detected in the pathological specimen only. The majority of patients (68 percent) did not have a preoperative diagnosis of dysplasia. Twenty-five percent of tumors were mucinous, 20 percent were multicentric, and 70 percent were located distal to the splenic flexure. Among the seven patients who died, four had pancolitis, six had a recent worsening of symptoms, and all had cancer involving the rectum.\nCONCLUSION: Cancer occurs at a younger age in patients with long-standing inflammatory bowel disease. The tumors are often mucinous, multiple, and located in the left colon. Despite increasing acceptance of surveillance colonoscopy as a recommended strategy in cancer prevention, almost one-half of the patients in this study had their cancer diagnosed because increased colitis symptoms led to colonoscopic examination. Eighteen percent of patients developed cancer with less than an eight-year history of inflammatory bowel disease. These data call into question the effectiveness of dysplasia surveillance as a population-based strategy to decrease the colorectal cancer mortality in inflammatory bowel disease patients.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32268844": "Patients with inflammatory bowel disease are at increased risk of colorectal cancer, which has worse prognosis than sporadic colorectal cancer. Until recently, understanding of pathogenesis in inflammatory bowel disease-associated colorectal cancer was restricted to the demonstration of chromosomic/microsatellite instabilities and aneuploidy. The advance of high-throughput sequencing technologies has highlighted the complexity of the pathobiology and revealed recurrently mutated genes involved in the RTK/RAS, PI3K, WNT, and TGF\u03b2 pathways, leading to potentially new targetable mutations. Moreover, alterations of mitochondrial DNA and the dysregulation of non-coding sequences have also been described, as well as several epigenetic modifications. Although recent studies have brought new insights into pathobiology and raised the prospect of innovative therapeutic approaches, the understanding of colorectal carcinogenesis in inflammatory bowel disease and how it differs from sporadic colorectal cancer remains not fully elucidated. Further studies are required to better understand the pathogenesis and molecular alterations leading to human inflammatory bowel disease-associated colorectal cancer.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11214128": "BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and colorectal cancer might share a common cause and, therefore, relatives of patients with IBD could be at increased risk of this malignant disease. We aimed to assess cancer rates among first-degree relatives of patients with IBD to try to determine whether an association between the two diseases exists.\nMETHODS: In a population-based study, we identified 114,102 first-degree relatives by registry linkage and followed them up for cancer occurrence. We used standardised incidence ratio (SIR) of cancer as relative risk.\nFINDINGS: 560 colorectal cancers were identified among relatives. First-degree relatives of patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis were not at increased risk of cancer (SIR 0.90, 95% CI 0.82-0.97). The relative risk was 0.96 (0.87-1.06, n=379) for colon cancer and 0.78 (0.68-0.91, 181) for rectal cancer. The SIRs were not affected by age, relation to patient, or type or extent of IBD in the patient. Relatives of patients with both IBD and colorectal cancer had an 80% increased risk of colorectal cancer.\nINTERPRETATION: Our results do not endorse a common cause of IBD and colorectal cancer. The slightly decreased relative risk for colorectal cancer among relatives could indicate the proportion of all colorectal cancer cases attributable to IBD.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12003711": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a complication in both patients with longstanding ulcerative colitis and those with Crohn's disease. As with sporadic CRC, surgical therapy (with adjuvant chemotherapy in advanced disease) is the only effective treatment. Identifying risk factors for CRC in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) should allow patients to receive appropriate medical, endoscopic, and surgical care to minimize CRC morbidity and mortality. Total proctocolectomy remains the most effective form of cancer prophylaxis in IBD patients, but because of the impact of this approach and the low absolute risk of cancer, clinicians seldom recommend it. Colonoscopic surveillance with systematic biopsies is used to detect mucosal dysplasia and thus identify those patients at greatest risk for developing CRC. Patients with dysplasia other than that in readily excised polyps should be referred for surgery. Although fraught with limitations, surveillance is the best method currently available for reducing CRC mortality and morbidity short of prophylactic colectomy. It will have to remain the standard of practice until better diagnostic tests are available. Surveillance should be offered and performed in the same manner for patients with Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Chemoprevention may prove effective in the future, but currently used agents have only a modest benefit, if any. Adenocarcinoma of the small intestine occurs at an increased rate in patients with Crohn's disease of the bowel with longstanding small bowel involvement, but there are no current methods of early detection. Treatment is based on disease identified from evaluation of symptoms or incidental finding. Some extraintestinal cancers have been noted to occur at increased rates in series from referral centers but not in population-based studies.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19317276": "Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) face an increased lifetime risk of developing colorectal cancer (CRC). Although CRC in IBD only accounts for 1-2% of all cases of CRC in the general population, it is responsible for approximately 15% of the mortality of patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Independent factors associated with increased risk include long disease duration, extensive colonic involvement, young age at onset of IBD, severity of inflammation, primary sclerosing cholangitis, backwash ileitis and a family history of CRC. Many of these factors emphasise the role of inflammation as an underlying mechanism. Despite the differences between the molecular abnormalities found in colitis-associated dysplasia in comparison with sporadic CRC, IBD-associated cancer has a similar dysplasia-cancer sequence, similar frequencies of major chromosomal abnormalities, microsatellite instability and similar glycosylation changes. These similarities seem to outweigh the differences and make it reasonable to suggest that not only IBD-associated CRC but even sporadic colon cancer might be largely secondary to inflammation. Oxidative stress, apoptosis, COX-2 activity and a possible common inherited defective glycosylation are thought to play a key role in the pathogenesis of colitis-associated CRC. DNA alterations initiated in colonic crypts can expand to adjacent crypts through crypt fission. There seems little doubt that the increased risk of cancer in inflammatory bowel diseases is a result of the disease rather than an inherited phenomenon. An understanding of the definition and pathogenesis of CRC in IBD is crucial to optimise patient management. Further investigation is therefore necessary.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11796261": "Ulcerative colitis and colonic Crohn's disease (together known as inflammatory bowel disease or IBD) are both associated with increased risk for colorectal cancer. Although it is customary to emphasize differences in the biology of IBD-associated and sporadic colon cancer, we believe these are far outweighed by the similarities. These similarities suggest that they might have similar pathogenic mechanisms. Because the normal colon is arguably in a continual state of low-grade inflammation in response to its microbial flora, it is reasonable to speculate that both IBD-associated and sporadic colon cancer might be the consequence of bacteria-induced inflammation.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16901385": "Adenocarcinoma of the colon is an accepted and feared complication of chronic ulcerative colitis (UC) and colonic Crohn's disease (CD). When cancer is identified, surgery is necessary, and unlike with sporadic colorectal cancer (CRC), in which partial colectomy is effective, proctocolectomy is required. As CRC is a rare complication of these diseases, studies of the pathogenesis are limited primarily to observational studies; thus, the mechanism and molecular events that lead to neoplastic change are not fully understood or well known. Precancerous dysplasia has been associated with concurrent or future CRC in UC and, although less studied, in CD, and is therefore considered a marker of cancer risk in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Risk factors for dysplasia and CRC in IBD include longer duration of disease, greater extent of disease, younger age at diagnosis, diagnosis with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), family history of CRC, and possibly backwash ileitis and degree of inflammation of the bowel over time. Prevention of cancer in IBD has been focused on secondary measures of identifying dysplasia in flat mucosa or protruding lesions during surveillance colonoscopy with random biopsies and, when confirmed, performing proctocolectomy. Studies of primary prevention of dysplasia and CRC using chemopreventive agents have suggested a possible benefit with a number of agents. These include ursodeoxycholic acid (in patients with PSC and UC), aminosalicylates, and possibly statins.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9559208": "A recurrent theme in the schema of pathogenetic mechanisms attributed to colorectal cancer (CRC) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is the interaction between genes and environment. Dietary and other environmental factors, and lower intestinal flora and their chemical interactions occur in the pathogenesis of both. Events at the mucosal surface may be influenced by factors in the luminal environment and by contributions of the host. In addition, both forms of IBD--Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC)--have distinctive associated host events. Even within CD and UC, different clinical patterns and prognoses may have different specific host mechanisms. Some of the current putative pathogenetic processes in CRC and IBD are reviewed. Particular attention is given to hypotheses relating to the role of dietetic substances, mainly fibre and dairy products, and how they may affect disease formation. It is argued that within the context of hypotheses proposed for possible beneficial effects of these two dietetic factors, CRC and IBD may be considered together. Further support is lent to arguments that similar and additional hypothetical features ascribed to beneficial effects of fibre may be attributed to disaccharides, lactose and its derivatives, lactulose and lactitol.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37663937": "Colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CAC) is defined as a specific cluster of colorectal cancers that develop as a result of prolonged colitis in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Patients with IBD, including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, are known to have an increased risk of developing CAC. Although the incidence of CAC has significantly decreased over the past few decades, individuals with CAC have increased mortality compared to individuals with sporadic colorectal cancer, and the incidence of CAC increases with duration. Chronic inflammation is generally recognized as a major contributor to the pathogenesis of CAC. CAC has been shown to progress from colitis to dysplasia and finally to carcinoma. Accumulating evidence suggests that multiple immune-mediated pathways, DNA damage pathways, and pathogens are involved in the pathogenesis of CAC. Over the past decade, there has been an increasing effort to develop clinical approaches that could help improve outcomes for CAC patients. Colonoscopic surveillance plays an important role in reducing the risk of advanced and interval cancers. It is generally recommended that CAC patients undergo endoscopic removal or colectomy. This review summarizes the current understanding of CAC, particularly its epidemiology, mechanisms, and management. It focuses on the mechanisms that contribute to the development of CAC, covering advances in genomics, immunology, and the microbiome; presents evidence for management strategies, including endoscopy and colectomy; and discusses new strategies to interfere with the process and development of CAC.

IBD-related CRC follows a different genetic and molecular pathogenic pathway than sporadic CRC and can be considered a complication of chronic intestinal inflammation. Since inflammation is recognised as an independent risk factor for neoplastic progression, clinicians strive to modulate and control disease, often using potent therapy agents to achieve mucosal healing and decrease the risk of colorectal cancer in IBD patients. Improved therapeutic control of inflammation, combined with endoscopic advances and early detection of pre-cancerous lesions through surveillance programs, explains the lower incidence rate of IBD-related CRC. In addition, current research is increasingly focused on translating emerging and advanced knowledge in microbiome and metagenomics into personalised, early, and non-invasive CRC screening tools that guide organ-sparing therapy in IBD patients. This review aims to summarise the existing literature on IBD-associated CRC, focusing on new insights into the alteration of the intestinal barrier and the interactions with the gut microbiome as the initial promoter.

Histologic IBD activity was assessed by the Nancy histologic index. Survival and Cox regression analysis were performed to assess the strength of the association of PIPs and other patient variables with progression to CRN.\nRESULTS: A total of 173 patients with at least two surveillance colonoscopies with PIPs at index colonoscopy were compared to a similar group of 252 patients without PIPs. In survival analysis, the presence or PIPs at index colonoscopy did not impact the risk of CRN in patients with histological inflammation (p\u2009=\u20090.83) and in patients without histological inflammation (p\u2009=\u20090.98). The risk of CRN was associated with increasing Nancy index score of 3 or 4 (HR: 4.16; 95% CI 1.50-11.52 and HR: 3.44; 95% CI 1.63-7.24), age (HR per 10-year increase: 1.37; 95% CI 1.13-1.66) and first-degree family history of colorectal cancer (HR: 5.87; v 1.31-26.26), but not PIPs (HR: 1.17; 95% CI 0.63-2.17).\nCONCLUSIONS: After controlling for histologic activity, PIPs do not increase the risk of CRN in IBD patients.

Data showed that mesalazine has antiproliferative properties associated with cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibition but can also act through COX-independent pathways.

The aim of this work was to investigate the interaction of these compounds in inhibiting BT uptake by Caco-2\u00a0cells, as a mechanism contributing to the link between IBD and CRC. TNF-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3, chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) and deoxycholic acid (DCA) markedly reduce 14C-BT uptake. All these compounds appear to inhibit MCT1-mediated BT cellular uptake at a posttranscriptional level, and, because their effect is not additive, they are most probably inhibiting MCT1 by a similar mechanism. Correspondingly, the antiproliferative effect of BT (MCT1-dependent) and of the proinflammatory cytokines and CDCA were not additive. In contrast, the cytotoxic effect of BT (MCT1-independent) and of the proinflammatory cytokines and CDCA were additive. In conclusion, proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3) and bile acids (DCA and CDCA) inhibit MCT1-mediated BT cellular uptake.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disease that predisposes to colorectal cancer. Tumorigenesis in this setting is associated with telomere shortening that can be observed in the nondysplastic epithelium of UC patients with high-grade dysplasia (HGD) or cancer (UC progressors). We hypothesized that a preneoplastic field of inflammation, telomere shortening, and senescence underlies tumor progression in UC progressors. Multiple biopsies of varying histologic grade were collected along the colon of nine UC progressors and analyzed for telomere length, DNA damage, senescence, p53, p16, and chronic and acute inflammation. Twenty biopsies from four UC nonprogressors and twenty-one biopsies from control individuals without UC were also analyzed. Short telomeres and increased DNA damage, senescence, and infiltrating leukocytes were observed in biopsies located less than 10 cm from HGD or cancer. Low-grade dysplasia (LGD) had the shortest telomeres along with the highest levels of senescence and infiltrating leukocytes, whereas HGD biopsies showed the opposite pattern. The expression of p16 and p53 was low in nondysplastic biopsies but progressively increased in LGD and HGD. In addition, high levels of infiltrating leukocytes were associated with telomere shortening, senescence, and reduced p53 expression. These results suggest that dysplasia arises in a preneoplastic field of chronic inflammation, which leads to telomere shortening, DNA damage, and senescence. Our findings argue that senescence acts as a tumor suppressor mechanism that is abrogated during the transition from LGD to HGD in UC.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19487293": "Inflammatory bowel disease, including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, substantially increases the risk of colorectal cancer. However, mechanisms linking mucosal inflammation to the sequence of dysplasia are incompletely understood. Whereas studies have shown oxidative damage to the colon, this study tests whether genotoxicity is elicited systemically by acute and chronic intestinal inflammation. In this study, genotoxic endpoints were assessed in peripheral leukocytes (DNA single- and double-stranded breaks and oxidative DNA damage) and normochromatic erythrocytes (micronuclei) during chemical or immune-mediated colitis. During three consecutive cycles of intestinal inflammation induced by dextran sulfate sodium administration, genotoxicity to peripheral leukocytes and erythroblasts was detected in both acute and chronic phases of dextran sulfate sodium-induced inflammation. Reactive oxygen species-mediated oxidative stress and DNA damage was confirmed with positive 8-oxoguanine and nitrotyrosine staining in peripheral leukocytes. Levels of DNA damage generally decreased during remission and increased during treatment, correlating with clinical symptoms and systemic inflammatory cytokine levels. In Galphai2(-/-) and interleukin-10(-/-) transgenic mice susceptible to immune-mediated colitis and inflammation-associated adenocarcinoma, similar levels of peripheral leukocyte and erythroblast genotoxicity were also observed. Moreover, this systemic genotoxicity was observed in mice with subclinical inflammation, which was further elevated in those with severe mucosal inflammation.

Immunohistochemical analysis was used to evaluate TRAP1 expression on tissue microarrays containing colonic tissues from 42 UC progressors (patients with cancer or dysplasia) and 38 non-progressors (dysplasia/cancer free patients). Statistical analyses of the TRAP1 immunohistochemistry staining were performed using GraphPad Prism. Differences in the TRAP1 level between non-progressors and progressors were tested for statistical significance using the Mann-Whitney test. Receiver operating characteristic curve method was used to quantify marker performance in distinguishing diseased cases from controls.\nRESULTS: TRAP1 was up-regulated in the colon tissues from UC progressors, but not in the colon tissues from UC non-progressors. Moreover, up-regulation of TRAP1 preceded the neoplastic changes: it was present in both the dysplastic and non-dysplastic tissues of UC progressors. When TRAP1 staining in rectal tissue was used as a diagnostic marker, it could distinguish progressors from non-progressors with 59% sensitivity and 80% specificity. Our study further showed that the increase of TRAP1 expression positively correlated with the degree of inflammation in the colorectal cancer tissues, which could be related to the increased oxidation present in the colonic mucosa from UC progressors. We then investigated the cellular proteome changes underlying oxidative stress, and found that oxidative stress could induce up-regulation of TRAP1 along with several other negative modulators of apoptosis.\nCONCLUSION: These results suggest that oxidative stress in long standing UC could lead to the increase of cytoprotective protein TRAP1, which in turn could promote cancer progression by preventing or protecting the oxidative damaged epithelial cells from undergoing apoptosis.

We also sought to determine whether molecular alterations found in biopsy specimens presaged their presence in subsequent resection specimens. Two hundred fifty-eight specimens from 52 patients were examined for K-ras mutations by direct sequencing. Seventy-one of the specimens were neoplastic. MSI was evaluated after polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification using primers directed at 8 microsatellite loci. Of the patients, 18.2% had K-ras mutations, and 30.8% had MSI in at least 1 locus. Of K-ras mutations, 81.8% were G to A substitutions involving the second nucleotide of codons 12 or 13. Only 0.7% of the samples showed a high level of MSI. No relationship existed between MSI and K-ras mutations, even in the 2 samples with high-level MSI. The numbers are small, but it appeared that MSI in biopsies failed to predict its presence in resection specimens. In contrast, K-ras mutations present in biopsy specimens tended to predict their presence in resections. K-ras mutations were found predominantly in neoplastic mucosae, whereas MSI was found predominantly in regenerative mucosae. The lack of any relationship between MSI and K-ras mutations suggests that MSI in the UC replicative mucosa does not predispose to colonic neoplasia via a K-ras-mediated pathway.

This study investigates the epidemiology of IBD-CRC and its outcomes.\nMETHODS: Using population data from the English National Health Service held in the CRC data repository, all CRCs with and without prior diagnosis of IBD (Crohn's, ulcerative colitis, IBD unclassified, and IBD with cholangitis) between 2005 and 2018 were identified. Descriptive analyses and logistic regression models were used to compare the characteristics of the 2 groups and their outcomes up to 2 years.\nRESULTS: Three hundred ninety thousand six hundred fourteen patients diagnosed with CRC were included, of whom 5,141 (1.3%) also had a previous diagnosis of IBD. IBD-CRC cases were younger (median age at CRC diagnosis [interquartile range] 66 [54-76] vs 72 [63-79] years [ P < 0.01]), more likely to be diagnosed with CRC as an emergency (25.1% vs 16.7% [ P < 0.01]), and more likely to have a right-sided colonic tumor (37.4% vs 31.5% [ P < 0.01]). Total colectomy was performed in 36.3% of those with IBD (15.4% of Crohn's, 44.1% of ulcerative colitis, 44.5% of IBD unclassified, and 67.7% of IBD with cholangitis).

Chronic mucosal inflammation is a key factor in the onset of carcinogenesis in IBD patients. Although most gene alterations that cause sporadic CRCs also occur in patients with IBD-associated CRC, some gene sequences and mutation frequencies differ between sporadic CRCs and IBD-associated CRCs.\nSUMMARY: This review explores the incidence of CRC in IBD patients, with the goal of identifying the risk and protective factors for CRC in order to facilitate dysplasia management via individualized surveillance strategies.\nKEY MESSAGE: The incidence of CRC is higher among IBD patients. Identifying the risk and protective factors for CRC will facilitate dysplasia management via individualized surveillance strategies.\nPRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: Several risk factors, including active inflammation, the coexistence of primary sclerosing cholangitis, a family history of sporadic CRC and the extent and duration of colonic disease, can lead to the development of CRC in patients with IBD. These risk factors should be utilized in individualized surveillance strategies to lower CRC incidence among IBD patients. Use of 5-aminosalicylic acid may play an important role in CRC prevention. Until newer, more reliable markers of IBD-associated CRC risk are found, dysplasia will continue to be the best marker of CRC risk in IBD.

Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio within 24 hours from the time they were last known to be well to undergo endovascular therapy and receive medical management or to receive medical management alone. The primary outcome was the score on the modified Rankin scale at 90 days (scores range from 0 to 6, with higher scores indicating greater disability), and the primary objective was to determine whether a shift in the distribution of the scores on the modified Rankin scale at 90 days had occurred between the two groups. Secondary outcomes included scores of 0 to 2 and 0 to 3 on the modified Rankin scale. The primary safety outcome was symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage within 48 hours after randomization.\nRESULTS: A total of 456 patients were enrolled; 231 were assigned to the endovascular-therapy group and 225 to the medical-management group. Approximately 28% of the patients in both groups received intravenous thrombolysis. The trial was stopped early owing to the efficacy of endovascular therapy after the second interim analysis. At 90 days, a shift in the distribution of scores on the modified Rankin scale toward better outcomes was observed in favor of endovascular therapy over medical management alone (generalized odds ratio, 1.37; 95% confidence interval, 1.11 to 1.69; P\u2009=\u20090.004).

Studies of left-side colon cancer (LCC) and right-side colon cancer (RCC) show that these two subtypes have different prognoses, outcomes, and clinical responses to chemotherapy. Therefore, a better understanding of the importance of the clinical classifications of the anatomic subtypes of colon cancer is needed.\nMETHODS: We collected colon cancer patients' transcriptome data, clinical information, and somatic mutation data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database portal. The transcriptome data were taken from 390 colon cancer patients (172 LCC samples and 218 RCC samples); the somatic mutation data included 142 LCC samples and 187 RCC samples. We compared the expression and prognostic differences of LCC and RCC by conducting a multi-omics analysis of each using the clinical characteristics, immune microenvironment, transcriptomic differences, and mutation differences. The prognostic signatures was validated using the internal testing set, complete set, and external testing set (GSE39582). We also verified the independent prognostic value of the signature.\nRESULTS: The results of our clinical characteristic analysis showed that RCC had a significantly worse prognosis than LCC. The analysis of the immune microenvironment showed that immune infiltration was more common in RCC than LCC. The results of differential gene analysis showed that there were 360 differentially expressed genes, with 142 upregulated genes in LCC and 218 upregulated genes in RCC. The mutation frequency of RCC was generally higher than that of LCC. BRAF and KRAS gene mutations were the dominant genes mutations in RCC, and they had a strong mutual exclusion with APC, while APC gene mutation was the dominant gene mutation in LCC. This suggests that the molecular mechanisms of RCC and LCC differed. The 4-mRNA and 6-mRNA in the prognostic signatures of LCC and RCC, respectively, were highly predictive and may be used as independent prognostic factors.\nCONCLUSION: The clinical classification of the anatomic subtypes of colon cancer is of great significance for early diagnosis and prognostic risk assessment.

However, colorectal cancer is not a single type of tumor; its pathogenesis depends on the anatomical location of the tumor and differs between right side and left side of the colon. Tumors in the proximal colon (right side) and distal colon (left side) exhibit different molecular characteristics and histology. In the right-sided tumors, mutations in the DNA mismatch repair pathway are commonly observed; and these tumors generally have a flat histology. In the left-sided tumors, chromosomal instability pathway-related mutations, such as KRAS, APC, PIK3CA, p53 mutations are observed and these tumors demonstrate polypoid-like morphology. Therapy responses are totally different between these tumor entities. Left-sided colorectal cancer (LCRC) patients benefit more from adjuvant chemotherapies such as 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-based regimes, and targeted therapies such as anti- epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) therapy, and have a better prognosis. Right-sided colorectal cancer (RCRC) patients do not respond well to conventional chemotherapies, but demonstrate more promising results with immunotherapies because these tumors have high antigenic load. For the development of effective therapy regimes and better treatment options, it is essential to evaluate right-sided and left-sided tumors as separate entities, and design the therapy regime considering the differences between these tumors.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29796712": "Colorectal cancer does not represent a single anatomic entity and side of origin has a key impact on prognosis and response to different systemic therapies. Compared to tumours arising in left colon, right colorectal cancers rely on the activation of different molecular pathways (e.g. BRAF mutation and MSI status).

Current guidelines suggest the use of cetuximab or panitumumab in RAS wild-type disease and left colon cancer especially for cytoreduction/conversion purposes, since the expected benefit in right colon cancer is absent or clinically modest. The prognostic role of microbiota in colorectal cancer disease deserves more clarification before being considered in common clinical practice.

Pooled rates and risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Heterogeneity among studies was evaluated. Overall, 16 studies including 698 patients with acute pancreatitis-associated SVT were eligible. After therapeutic anticoagulation, the pooled rates of SVT recanalization, any bleeding, death, intestinal ischemia, portal cavernoma, and gastroesophageal varices were 44.3% (95%CI\u2009=\u200932.3%-56.6%), 10.7% (95%CI\u2009=\u20094.9%-18.5%), 13.3% (95%CI\u2009=\u20096.9%-21.4%), 16.8% (95%CI\u2009=\u20096.9%-29.9%), 21.2% (95%CI\u2009=\u20097.5%-39.5%), and 29.1% (95%CI\u2009=\u200916.1%-44.1%), respectively.

The threshold to assume group agreement was set at 75%.\nRESULTS: The response rate was 67% (n = 93). Seventy-one pancreatologists (77%) regularly prescribed therapeutic anticoagulation in case of SVT, and 12 pancreatologists (13%) for narrowing of splanchnic vein lumen. The most common reason to treat SVT was to avoid complications (87%). Acute thrombosis was the most important factor to prescribe therapeutic anticoagulation (90%).

Moreover, clinical outcome measures such as mortality, organ failure and length of hospital and ICU stay were also compared between NAP patients with or without SVT.\nRESULTS: According to the statistical results, only intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) was proved to be an independent risk factor for SVT (OR, 1.283; 95% CI, 1.091-1.509,P=0.003). In addition, Balthazar's CT score and occurrence of IPN (infected pancreatic necrosis) also reached statistical significance (P=0.040 and 0.047, respectively), but the 95% confidence interval shown in the multivariate logistic regression suggested that the observed ORs are not significant (1.326;95% CI 0.984-1.787 and 2.61;95 CI 0.972-7.352, respectively), which indicates weaker association between the two parameters and SVT. Regarding the clinical outcomes, patients with SVT showed higher mortality, longer hospital and intensive care unit duration, higher rates of a variety of complications and more utilization of invasive interventions.\nCONCLUSIONS: IAP is an independent risk factor for the development of SVT in patients with NAP, while Balthazar's CT score and occurrence of IPN are also associated with SVT, although not as strong as IAP. Moreover, occurrence of SVT relates with extremely poor prognosis in NAP patients, evidenced by increased mortality, morbidity and need for invasive interventions.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22081920": "OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine current practice in the management and outcome of splanchnic vein thrombosis complicating acute pancreatitis (AP).\nMETHODS: An audit of prospectively collected data for all patients presenting with AP was conducted.

Her physical examination was notable only for moderate epigastric tenderness. She was apyrexic and had no jaundice or any features of liver failure. An initial computed tomographic scan showed Balthazar grade C pancreatitis with multiple splanchnic thromboses involving the portal vein, superior mesenteric vein, and left renal vein and enteromesenteric venous infarct with no signs of bowel perforation. The inferior vena cava was patent. Therapeutic anticoagulation and analgesia were started with resumption of enteral feeding 72\u2009h later. The result of a thrombophilia screen was negative.

In antibiotics-treated or germ-free mice, tumor-infiltrating myeloid-derived cells responded poorly to therapy, resulting in lower cytokine production and tumor necrosis after CpG-oligonucleotide treatment and deficient production of reactive oxygen species and cytotoxicity after chemotherapy.

This finding has or could have considerable relevance as it is possible that our ability to modulate and modify the microbial structure before, during, and after treatment could influence all the clinical parameters related to pharmacological treatments and, eventually, the prognosis of the disease.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38013112": "BACKGROUND: The microbiota inhabits the epithelial surfaces of hosts, which influences physiological functions from helping digest food and acquiring nutrition to regulate metabolism and shaping host immunity.

Despite therapeutic advances in dealing with this malignancy, heterogeneous response and resistance to chemotherapeutic agents remain the hallmarks of cancer therapy. On the other hand, the involvement of the microbiota in affecting human health is well defined. An ever-growing body of evidence implicates the potential link between the microbiome and the efficacy of cancer therapies. Gut microbiota can modulate the metabolism of drugs in a number of ways. The presence of bacteria within the tumor environment can also impact the responses to cancer therapies; changing the chemical structure of chemotherapeutic drugs, affecting their activity, and local concentration. However, the underlying mechanisms by which gut and tumor microbial communities affect the response to cancer therapy are poorly understood and deciphering these mechanisms is of paramount importance. This review provides an overview of how gut and tumor microbiota might affect the efficacy of chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and immunotherapy and alleviate the adverse side effects of these therapies for the development of personalized and effective anticancer therapy.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37029611": "Despite the recognition that the gut microbiota acts a clinically significant role in cancer chemotherapy, both mechanistic understanding and translational research are still limited. Maximizing drug efficacy requires an in-depth understanding of how the microbiota contributes to therapeutic responses, while microbiota modulation is hindered by the complexity of the human body. To address this issue, a 3D experimental model named engineered microbiota (EM) is reported for bridging microbiota-drug interaction research and therapeutic decision-making. EM can be manipulated in vitro and faithfully recapitulate the human gut microbiota at the genus/species level while allowing co-culture with cells, organoids, and isolated tissues for testing drug responses. Examination of various clinical and experimental drugs by EM reveales that the gut microbiota affects drug efficacy through three pathways: immunological effects, bioaccumulation, and drug metabolism. Guided by discovered mechanisms, custom-tailored strategies are adopted to maximize the therapeutic efficacy of drugs on orthotopic tumor models with patient-derived gut microbiota. These strategies include immune synergy, nanoparticle encapsulation, and host-guest complex formation, respectively. Given the important role of the gut microbiota in influencing drug efficacy, EM will likely become an indispensable tool to guide drug translation and clinical decision-making.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37707749": "Resistance to therapeutic agents is one of the major challenges in cancer therapy. Generally, the focus is given to the genetic driver, especially the genetic mutation behind the therapeutic resistance. However, non-mutational mechanisms, such as epigenetic modifications, and TME alteration, which is mainly driven by cancer cell plasticity, are also involved in therapeutic resistance. The concept of plasticity mainly relies on the conversion of non-cancer stem cells (CSCs) to CSCs or epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition via different mechanisms and various signaling pathways. Cancer plasticity plays a crucial role in therapeutic resistance as cancer cells are able to escape from therapeutics by shifting the phenotype and thereby enhancing tumor progression. New evidence suggests that gut microbiota can change cancer cell characteristics by impacting the mechanisms involved in cancer plasticity. Interestingly, gut microbiota can also influence the therapeutic efficacy of anticancer drugs by modulating the mechanisms involved in cancer cell plasticity. The gut microbiota has been shown to reduce the toxicity of certain clinical drugs. Here, we have documented the critical role of the gut microbiota on the therapeutic efficacy of existing anticancer drugs by altering the cancer plasticity. Hence, the extended knowledge of the emerging role of gut microbiota in cancer cell plasticity can help to develop gut microbiota-based novel therapeutics to overcome the resistance or reduce the toxicity of existing drugs.

For example, the microbial signature associated with HIV infection has been shown to induce tryptophan catabolism, affect the butyrate synthesis pathway, impair anti-tumoral immunity and affect oxidative stress, which have also been linked to the pathogenesis of cancer. Furthermore, some of the taxa that are depleted in subjects with HIV have proved to modulate the anti-tumor efficacy of various chemotherapies and immunotherapeutic agents.

Although neuroinflammation is a hallmark shared by the neuropsychological complications of chemotherapy (including cognitive impairment, fatigue and depression), the use of microbial-based therapeutics has not previously been studied in this setting. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the effect of a high fibre diet known to modulate the microbiota, and its associated metabolome, on neuroinflammation caused by the common chemotherapeutic agent 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Twenty-four female C57Bl/6 mice were treated with 5-FU (400\u00a0mg/kg, intraperitoneal, i.p.) or vehicle control, with or without a high fibre diet (constituting amylose starch; 4.7\u00a0% crude fibre content), given one week prior to 5-FU and until study completion (16\u00a0days after 5-FU). Faecal pellets were collected longitudinally for 16S rRNA gene sequencing and terminal SCFA concentrations of the caecal contents were quantified using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Neuroinflammation was determined by immunofluorescent analysis of astrocyte density (GFAP). The high fibre diet significantly altered gut microbiota composition, increasing the abundance of Bacteroidaceae and Akkermansiaceae (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001 and p\u00a0=\u00a00.0179) whilst increasing the production of propionate (p\u00a0=\u00a00.0097).

Astrocyte density negatively correlated with propionate concentrations and the abundance of Bacteroidaceae and Akkermansiaceae, suggesting a relationship between neuroinflammatory and gastrointestinal markers in this model.

Therefore, extensive research is underway to find methods to improve their therapeutic efficacy. One avenue of study that has recently emerged is to consider the role the gut microbiome plays in therapeutic success. Several high-impact studies have repeatedly shown that the presence, composition and level of diversity of the gut flora directly impact cancer treatment outcome in both mice and patients. These studies have also highlighted the danger of using antibiotics shortly before or during cancer treatments. However, there are still several questions that need to be answered, including which bacteria promote the greatest benefit, the mechanisms by which they act and how we can use this information to influence treatment outcome. In this review, we explain how the gut microbiome was realized to be of such importance and propose hypotheses for why gut flora have such a critical impact on ICB therapeutic success. We also describe a hypothetical mechanism involving bacterial translocation out of the gut and into the tumor, whereby the bacteria act in an adjuvant capacity to facilitate an antitumor response.

The composition of fecal microbiota, the activation of NF-kB pathway in cancer tissues and the serum metabolomics were further analyzed.\nRESULTS: Gemcitabine considerably decreases the proportion of Gram- positive Firmicutes (from about 39 to 17%) and the Gram- negative Bacteroidetes (from 38 to 17%) which are the two dominant phyla in the gut of tumor-bearing control mice. This downshift was replaced by an increase of Proteobacteria (Escherichia coli and Aeromonas hydrophila) from 15 up to 32% and Verrucomicrobia (Akkermansia muciniphila) from 5 to 33% in the gut of drug-receiving mice. An overall increase in inflammation-associated bacteria was observed upon gemcitabine.

Tagraxofusp had an acceptable safety profile and high efficacy in early phase I/II studies on patients with BPDCN. Another phase II study confirmed the good response rates, resulting in Food and Drugs Administration and European Medicine Agency approval of tagraxofusp for the treatment of BPDCN. Considering its high efficacy and its manageable safety profile, tagraxofusp has been suddenly explored in other myeloid malignancies with high expression of cell surface CD123, both in monotherapy or combination strategies. The triplet tagraxofusp-azacytidine-venetoclax appears to be of particular interest among these combinations. Furthermore, combination strategies may be used to overcome tagraxofusp resistance. The downregulation of DPH1 (diphthamide biosynthesis 1), the enzyme responsible for the conversion of histidine 715 on eEF2 to diphthamide, which is then the direct target of ADP ribosylation DT, is typically associated with this resistance phenomenon. It has been discovered that azacitidine can reverse DHP1 expression and restore sensitivity to tagraxofusp.

Expression of DPH1, encoding a diphthamide pathway enzyme, was reduced by DNA CpG methylation in resistant cells. Treatment with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor azacitidine restored DPH1 expression and tagraxofusp sensitivity. We also developed a drug-dependent ADP-ribosylation assay in primary cells that correlated with tagraxofusp activity and may represent an additional novel biomarker. As predicted by these results and our observation that resistance also increased mitochondrial apoptotic priming, we found that the combination of tagraxofusp and azacitidine was effective in patient-derived xenografts treated in vivo. These data have important implications for clinical use of tagraxofusp and led to a phase 1 study combining tagraxofusp and azacitidine in myeloid malignancies.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31018069": "BACKGROUND: Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic-cell neoplasm (BPDCN) is an aggressive hematologic cancer that is caused by transformed plasmacytoid dendritic cells that overexpress interleukin-3 receptor subunit alpha (IL3RA or CD123). Tagraxofusp (SL-401) is a CD123-directed cytotoxin consisting of human interleukin-3 fused to truncated diphtheria toxin.\nMETHODS: In this open-label, multicohort study, we assigned 47 patients with untreated or relapsed BPDCN to receive an intravenous infusion of tagraxofusp at a dose of 7 \u03bcg or 12 \u03bcg per kilogram of body weight on days 1 to 5 of each 21-day cycle. Treatment continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxic effects. The primary outcome was the combined rate of complete response and clinical complete response among patients who had not received previous treatment for BPDCN. A secondary outcome was the duration of response.\nRESULTS: Of the 47 patients, 32 were receiving tagraxofusp as first-line treatment and 15 had received previous treatment. The median age of the patients was 70 years (range, 22 to 84). Among the 29 previously untreated patients who received tagraxofusp at a dose of 12 \u03bcg per kilogram, the primary outcome occurred in 21 (72%), and the overall response rate was 90%; of these patients, 45% went on to undergo stem-cell transplantation. Survival rates at 18 and 24 months were 59% and 52%, respectively. Among the 15 previously treated patients, the response rate was 67%, and the median overall survival was 8.5 months. The most common adverse events were increased levels of alanine aminotransferase (64%) and aspartate aminotransferase (60%), hypoalbuminemia (55%), peripheral edema (51%), and thrombocytopenia (49%). Capillary leak syndrome was reported in 19% of the patients and was associated with one death in each of the dose subgroups.\nCONCLUSIONS: In adult patients with untreated or relapsed BPDCN, the use of tagraxofusp led to clinical responses. Serious adverse events included capillary leak syndrome; hepatic dysfunction and thrombocytopenia were common.

BPDCN is most often characterized by its presentation with distinct cutaneous lesions. Bone marrow involvement, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and/or cytopenias are also seen to varying degrees. BPDCN presents with diffuse, monomorphous blasts with irregular nuclei, fine chromatin, and scant, agranular cytoplasm. Expression of CD4, CD56, and CD123 is the hallmark of BPDCN. The presence of \u22654 of CD4, CD56, CD123, TCL1, TCF4, and CD303 is necessary for the diagnosis of BPDCN. Prior to December 2018, management of BPDCN revolved around intensive chemotherapy using acute myeloid leukemia or acute lymphoblastic leukemia regimens. However, responses were transient with poor overall survival (OS). Allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) is the only potentially curative treatment for BPDCN. Even so, only a minority of patients are candidates for alloSCT given the preponderance of disease in older individuals. For the few fit patients who are candidates for alloSCT, the aim is to achieve complete remission prior to alloSCT. Tagraxofusp (SL-401), a recombinant fusion protein containing interleukin-3 fused to truncated diphtheria toxin, was the first approved CD123-targeted therapy for BPDCN based on a phase I/II clinical trial showing a 90% overall response rate. It was approved by the FDA on December 21, 2018. Capillary leak syndrome is an important adverse effect of tagraxofusp that requires close monitoring.

MPDCP is a clonal expansion of mature pDCs that is predominantly associated with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. In contrast, BPDCN is a clinically aggressive myeloid malignancy involving the skin, bone marrow, lymphatic organs, and central nervous system. There are various types of skin lesions, ranging from solitary brown or violaceous to disseminated cutaneous lesions, which often spread throughout the body. The expression of CD4, CD56, CD123, and pDC markers (TCL-1, TCF4, CD303, and CD304, etc.) are typical immunophenotype of BPDCN.

They serve pivotal roles in maintaining several health and disease conditions, such as inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, obesity and diabetes. Known major factors involved in cancer development include age, hormone levels, alcohol consumption, diet, being overweight, obesity, and infections, regardless of the type of cancer.

Studies show that the imidazole ring of diphthamide plays an important role in the ADP-ribosylation catalyzed by the toxin. In this work, we employ different in silico molecular dynamics (MD) simulation approaches to understand the role of diphthamide versus unmodified histidine in eEF2 on the interaction with ETA. Crystal structures of the eEF2-ETA complexes with three different ligands NAD+, ADP-ribose, and \u03b2TAD were selected and compared in the diphthamide and histidine containing systems. The study shows that NAD+ bound to ETA remains very stable in comparison with other ligands, enabling the transfer of ADP-ribose to the N3 atom of the diphthamide imidazole ring in eEF2 during ribosylation. We also show that unmodified histidine in eEF2 has a negative impact on ETA binding and is not a suitable target for the attachment of ADP-ribose. Analyzing of radius of gyration and COM distances for NAD+, \u03b2TAD, and ADP-ribose complexes revealed that unmodified His affects the structure and destabilizes the complex with all different ligands throughout the MD simulations.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37246715": "Diphthamide (DPH), a conserved amino acid modification on eukaryotic translation elongation factor eEF2, is synthesized via a complex, multi-enzyme pathway.

Characterizing Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutants that lack DPH or show synthetic growth defects in the absence of DPH, we show that loss of DPH increases resistance to the fungal translation inhibitor sordarin and increases -1 ribosomal frameshifting at non-programmed sites during normal translation elongation and at viral programmed frameshifting sites. Ribosome profiling of yeast and mammalian cells lacking DPH reveals increased ribosomal drop-off during elongation, and removal of out-of-frame stop codons restores ribosomal processivity on the ultralong yeast MDN1 mRNA. Finally, we show that ADP-ribosylation of DPH impairs the productive binding of eEF2 to elongating ribosomes. Our results reveal that loss of DPH impairs the fidelity of translocation during translation elongation resulting in increased rates of ribosomal frameshifting throughout elongation and leading to premature termination at out-of-frame stop codons.

However, the role of DPH1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. To investigate the impact of DPH1 in hepatocellular carcinogenesis, we performed data mining from The Cancer Genome Atlas Liver Hepatocellular Carcinoma (TCGA-LIHC) dataset. We found that reduced DPH1 levels were associated with advanced stages and poor survival of patients with HCC. Also, we generated hepatocyte-specific Dph1-deficient mice and showed that diphthamide-deficient EEF2 resulted in a reduced translation elongation rate in the hepatocytes and led to mild liver damage with fatty accumulation. After N-diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced acute liver injury, p53-mediated pericentral hepatocyte death was increased, and compensatory proliferation was reduced in Dph1-deficient mice. Consistent with these effects, Dph1 deficiency decreased the incidence of DEN-induced pericentral-derived HCC and revealed a protective effect against p53 loss. In contrast, Dph1 deficiency combined with Trp53- or Trp53/Pten-deficient hepatocytes led to increased tumor loads associated with KRT19 (K19)-positive periportal-like cell expansion in mice. Further gene set enrichment analysis also revealed that HCC patients with lower levels of DPH1 and TP53 expression had enriched gene-sets related to the cell cycle and K19-upregulated HCC. Additionally, liver tumor organoids obtained from 6-month-old Pten/Trp53/Dph1-triple-mutant mice had a higher frequency of organoid re-initiation cells and higher proliferative index compared with those of the Pten/Trp53-double-mutant.

Recent studies have suggested that diphthamide has specific functions for the cellular stress response and active proliferation.

In the first step of diphthamide biosynthesis, a [4Fe-4S] cluster-containing radical SAM enzyme, Dph1-Dph2 heterodimer in eukaryotes or Dph2 homodimer in archaea, cleaves S-adenosylmethionine and transfers the 3-amino-3-carboxypropyl group to EF2. It was demonstrated previously that for the archaeal Dph2 homodimer, only one [4Fe-4S] cluster is necessary for the in vitro activity. Here, we demonstrate that for the eukaryotic Dph1-Dph2 heterodimer, the [4Fe-4S] cluster-binding cysteine residues in each subunit are required for diphthamide biosynthesis to occur in vivo. Furthermore, our in vitro reconstitution experiments with Dph1-Dph2 mutants suggested that the Dph1 cluster serves a catalytic role, while the Dph2 cluster facilitates the reduction of the Dph1 cluster by the physiological reducing system Dph3/Cbr1/NADH.

Diphthamide is not only essential for normal physiology (such as ensuring fidelity of mRNA translation), but is also exploited by bacterial ADP-ribosylating toxins (e.g., diphtheria toxin) as their molecular target in pathogenesis. Taking advantage of the observation that cells defective in diphthamide biosynthesis are resistant to ADP-ribosylating toxins, in the past four decades, seven essential genes (Dph1 to Dph7) have been identified for diphthamide biosynthesis. These technically unsaturated screens raise the question as to whether additional genes are required for diphthamide biosynthesis. In this study, we performed two independent, saturating, genome-wide CRISPR knockout screens in human cells. These screens identified all previously known Dph genes, as well as further identifying the BTB/POZ domain-containing transcription factor Miz1. We found that Miz1 is absolutely required for diphthamide biosynthesis via its role in the transcriptional regulation of Dph1 expression. Mechanistically, Miz1 binds to the Dph1 proximal promoter via an evolutionarily conserved consensus binding site to activate Dph1 transcription. Therefore, this work demonstrates that Dph1-7, along with the newly identified Miz1 transcription factor, are likely to represent the essential protein factors required for diphthamide modification on eEF2.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18765564": "The intracellular target of diphtheria toxin is a modified histidine residue, diphthamide, in the translation elongation factor, eEF2 (also known as EFT1).

Mice that were homozygous for the mutation were retarded in growth and development, and almost always die before birth. Those that survive long enough had preaxial polydactyly, a duplication of digit 1 of the hind foot.

Plasmid-borne EFT was randomly mutagenized at the histidine 699 codon, and the technique of plasmid shuffling was utilized to select strains that were maintained by the mutant EFT. These mutants were screened for diphtheria toxin resistance. Sequence analysis of the EFT in 49 toxin-resistant isolates showed that histidine 699 had been replaced by 1 of 4 amino acids: asparagine, glutamine, leucine, or methionine. All 11 of the possible codons corresponding to these 4 amino acids were found. The growth rates of cells sustained by the mutant forms of EF-2 were slightly slower than those of isogenic wild-type cells.

We generated MCF7 breast cancer cell line-derived DPH gene knockout (ko) cells to assess the impact of complete or partial inactivation on diphthamide synthesis and toxin sensitivity, and to address the biological consequence of diphthamide deficiency. Cells with heterozygous gene inactivation still contained predominantly diphthamide-modified eEF2 and were as sensitive to PE and DT as parent cells. Thus, DPH gene copy number reduction does not affect overall diphthamide synthesis and toxin sensitivity.

Our laboratory has recently showed that in Pyrococcus horikoshii (P. horikoshii), the first step uses a [4Fe-4S] enzyme PhDph2 to generate a 3-amino-3-carboxypropyl radical from S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) to form a C\u2212C bond.

Closed-form sample size formulae are derived to ensure that each subtrial has a specified chance of correctly deciding whether the new treatment is superior to or not better than the control by some clinically relevant difference. Given prespecified levels of pairwise (in)commensurability, the subtrial sample sizes are solved simultaneously.

We propose a two-stage phase II adaptive biomarker basket (ABB) design based on a potential predictive biomarker measured on a continuous scale. At Stage 1, the design incorporates a biomarker cutoff estimation procedure via a hierarchical Bayesian model with biomarker as a covariate (HBMbc). At Stage 2, the design enrolls only BM+ subjects, defined as those with the biomarker values exceeding the biomarker cutoff within each cancer type, and subsequently assesses the early efficacy and/or futility stopping through the pre-defined interim analyses. At the end of the trial, the response rate of all BM+ subjects for each cancer type can guide drug development, while the data from all subjects can be used to further model the relationship between the biomarker value and the clinical outcome for potential future research.

Increasingly, new drugs are designed to work against a target such as the presence of a specific tumor mutation. Because typically only a small proportion of cancer patients will possess the mutational target, but the mutation is present in many different cancers, a new class of basket trials is emerging, whereby the drug is tested simultaneously in different baskets, that is, subgroups of different tumor types. Investigators desire not only to test whether the drug works but also to determine which types of tumors are sensitive to the drug. A natural strategy is to conduct parallel trials, with the drug 's effectiveness being tested separately, using for example, the popular Simon two-stage design independently in each basket. The work presented is motivated by the premise that the efficiency of this strategy can be improved by assessing the homogeneity of the baskets ' response rates at an interim analysis and aggregating the baskets in the second stage if the results suggest the drug might be effective in all or most baskets. Via simulations, we assess the relative efficiencies of the two strategies. Because the operating characteristics depend on how many tumor types are sensitive to the drug, there is no uniformly efficient strategy.

After adjusting for covariates, information from a complementary subtrial can be represented into a commensurate prior for the parameter that underpins the subtrial under consideration. We propose using distributional discrepancy to characterize the commensurability between subtrials for appropriate borrowing of information through a spike-and-slab prior, which is placed on the prior precision factor. When the basket trial has at least three subtrials, commensurate priors for point-to-point borrowing are combined into a marginal predictive prior, according to the weights transformed from the pairwise discrepancy measures. In this way, only information from subtrial(s) with the most commensurate treatment effect is leveraged. The marginal predictive prior is updated to a robust posterior by the contemporary subtrial data to inform decision making.

One effective type of clinical trial is called a basket trial.

Basket trials offer several advantages over running a series of separate trials, including reduced sample sizes, increased efficiency, and reduced costs. Primarily, basket trials have been undertaken in Phase II oncology settings, but could be a promising design in other areas where a shared underlying biological mechanism drives different diseases. One such area is chronic aging-related diseases. However, trials in this area frequently have longitudinal outcomes, and therefore suitable methods are needed to share information in this setting. In this paper, we extend three Bayesian borrowing methods for a basket design with continuous longitudinal endpoints. We demonstrate our methods on a real-world dataset and in a simulation study where the aim is to detect positive basketwise treatment effects. Methods are compared with standalone analysis of each basket without borrowing. Our results confirm that methods that share information can improve power to detect positive treatment effects and increase precision over independent analysis in many scenarios. In highly heterogeneous scenarios, there is a trade-off between increased power and increased risk of type I errors. Our proposed methods for basket trials with continuous longitudinal outcomes aim to facilitate their applicability in the area of aging related diseases.

Therefore, we have designed a organ-agnostic basket study, which covers a variety of solid cancers harboring HER2 amplification, in 1 study protocol.\nMETHODS/DESIGN: This trial is a multicenter, single-arm, basket phase 2 study in Japan. Patients with solid cancers harboring HER2 amplification that have progressed with standard treatment, or rare cancers for which there is no standard treatment, will be eligible. Target cancers include bile duct, urothelial, uterine, ovarian, and other solid cancers where HER2 amplification is detected by comprehensive genomic profiling using next-generation sequencing technology. A total of 38 patients will be treated with combination therapy with trastuzumab and pertuzumab every 3 weeks until disease progression, unmanageable toxicity, death, or patient refusal. The primary endpoint is the objective response rate, and secondary endpoints are progression-free survival, overall survival, and duration of response.\nDISCUSSION: The aim of this trial is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of combination therapy with trastuzumab and pertuzumab in patients with locally advanced or metastatic, solid cancers harboring HER2 amplification. Instead of focusing on 1 organ type, our trial design uses a basket study focusing on HER2 amplification, regardless of the site or origin of the cancer. The results of our study will advance clinical and scientific knowledge concerning the treatment of locally advanced, rare solid cancers harboring HER2 amplification, using the combination of trastuzumab and pertuzumab.\nTRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial was registered in Japan Registry of Clinical Trials (jCRT) on February 25, 2019, as jRCT2031180150.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38033501": "BACKGROUND: Basket trials are increasingly used in oncology drug development for early signal detection, accelerated tumor-agnostic approvals, and prioritization of promising tumor types in selected patients with the same mutation or biomarker. Participants are grouped into so-called baskets according to tumor type, allowing investigators to identify tumors with promising responses to treatment for further study. However, it remains a question as to whether and how much the adoption of basket trial designs in oncology have translated into patient benefits, increased pace and scale of clinical development, and de-risking of downstream confirmatory trials.\nMETHODS: Innovation in basket trial design and analysis includes methods that borrow information across tumor types to increase the quality of statistical inference within each tumor type. We build on the existing systematic reviews of basket trials in oncology to discuss the current practices and landscape. We conceptually illustrate recent innovative methods for basket trials, with application to actual data from recently completed basket trials. We explore and discuss the extent to which innovative basket trials can be used to de-risk future trials through their ability to aid prioritization of promising tumor types for subsequent clinical development.\nRESULTS: We found increasing adoption of basket trial design in oncology, but largely in the design of single-arm phase II trials with a very low adoption of innovative statistical methods. Furthermore, the current practice of basket trial design, which does not consider its impact on the clinical development plan, may lead to a missed opportunity in improving the probability of success of a future trial. Gating phase II with a phase Ib basket trial reduced the size of phase II trials, and losses in the probability of success as a result of not using innovative methods may not be recoverable by running a larger phase II trial.\nCONCLUSION: Innovative basket trial methods can reduce the size of early phase clinical trials, with sustained improvement in the probability of success of the clinical development plan. We need to do more as a community to improve the adoption of these methods.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33942894": "Basket trials have become a virulent topic in medical and statistical research during the last decade. The core idea of them is to treat patients, who express the same genetic predisposition-either personally or their disease-with the same treatment irrespective of the location of the disease. The location of the disease defines each basket and the pathway of the treatment uses the common genetic predisposition among the baskets. This opens the opportunity to share information among baskets, which can consequently increase the information of the basket-wise response with respect to the investigated treatment. This further allows dynamic decisions regarding futility and efficacy of individual baskets during the ongoing trial. Several statistical designs have been proposed on how a basket trial can be conducted and this has left an unclear situation with many options. The different designs propose different mathematical and statistical techniques, different decision rules, and also different trial purposes. This paper presents a broad overview of existing designs, categorizes them, and elaborates their similarities and differences. A uniform and consistent notation facilitates the first contact, introduction, and understanding of the statistical methodologies and techniques used in basket trials.

The existing basket designs with Bayesian hierarchical models often improve the efficiency of evaluating therapeutic effects; however, these models calibrate the type I error rate based on the results of simulation studies under various selected scenarios. The theoretical control of family-wise error rate (FWER) is important for decision-making regarding drug approval.\nMETHODS: In this study, we propose a new Bayesian two-stage design with one interim analysis for controlling FWER at the target level, along with the formulations of type I and II error rates. Since the difficulty lies in the complexity of the theoretical formulation of the type I error rate, we devised the simulation-based method to approximate the type I error rate.\nRESULTS: The proposed design enabled adjustment of the cutoff value to control the FWER at the target value in the final analysis. The simulation studies demonstrated that the proposed design can be used to control the well-approximated FWER below the target value even in situations where the number of enrolled patients differed among subpopulations.\nCONCLUSIONS: The accrual number of patients is sometimes unable to reach the pre-defined value; therefore, existing basket designs may not ensure defined operating characteristics before beginning the trial. The proposed design that enables adjustment of the cutoff value to control FWER at the target value based on the results in the final analysis would be a better alternative.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32031692": "With advancements in biomarkers and momentum in precision medicine, biomarker-guided trials such as basket trials and umbrella trials have been developed under the master protocol framework. A master protocol refers to a single, overarching design developed to evaluate multiple hypotheses with the general goal of improving the efficiency of trial evaluation. One type of master protocol is the basket trial, in which a targeted therapy is evaluated for multiple diseases that share common molecular alterations or risk factors that may help predict whether the patients will respond to the given therapy. Another variant of a master protocol is the umbrella trial, in which multiple targeted therapies are evaluated for a single disease that is stratified into multiple subgroups based on different molecular or other predictive risk factors. Both designs follow the core principle of precision medicine-to tailor intervention strategies based on the patient's risk factor(s) that can help predict whether they will respond to a specific treatment. There have been increasing numbers of basket and umbrella trials, but they are still poorly understood.

Basket, umbrella, and adaptive enrichment strategies represent a class of novel designs for testing targeted therapeutics in oncology. Umbrella trials include a central infrastructure for screening and identification of patients, and focus on a single tumor type or histology with multiple subtrials, each testing a targeted therapy within a molecularly defined subset. Basket trial designs offer the possibility to include multiple molecularly defined subpopulations, often across histology or tumor types, but included in one cohesive design to evaluate the targeted therapy in question. Adaptive enrichment designs offer the potential to enrich for patients with a particular molecular feature that is predictive of benefit for the test treatment based on accumulating evidence from the trial. This review will aim to discuss the fundamentals of these design strategies, the underlying statistical framework, the logistical barriers of implementation, and, ultimately, the interpretation of the trial results. New statistical approaches, extensive multidisciplinary collaboration, and state of the art data capture technologies are needed to implement these strategies in practice. Logistical challenges to implementation arising from centralized assay testing, requirement of multiple specimens, multidisciplinary collaboration, and infrastructure requirements will also be discussed.

Empirical findings suggest that treatment efficacy across baskets may be heterogeneous. Most modern basket trial designs use Bayesian methods. These methods require the prior specification of at least one parameter that permits information sharing across baskets. In this study, we provide recommendations for selecting a prior for scale parameters for adaptive basket trials by using Bayesian hierarchical modeling. Heterogeneity among baskets attracts much attention in basket trial research, and substantial heterogeneity challenges the basic assumption of exchangeability of Bayesian hierarchical approach. Thus, we also allowed each stratum-specific parameter to be exchangeable or nonexchangeable with similar strata by using data observed in an interim analysis. Through a simulation study, we evaluated the overall performance of our design based on statistical power and type I error rates.

The panel focused on master protocols, which include umbrella trials, platform trials, and basket trials. Umbrella trials and platform trials share many commonalities, whereas basket trials are more distinct. Umbrella and platform trials are generally designed with multiple arms where patients of the same histology or other unifying characteristics are enrolled into different arms and multiple investigational agents are evaluated in a single protocol. In contrast, basket studies generally enroll patients with different tumor types based on the presence of a specific mutation or biomarker regardless of histology; these trials may include expansion cohorts. These novel designs offer the promise of expedited drug assessment and approval, but they also place new challenges on all the stakeholders involved in the drug development process. Only by identifying the challenges of these complex, innovative clinical trial designs and highlighting challenges from each perspective can we begin to address these challenges.

To date, most basket trials have been conducted in early-phase oncology settings, for which several Bayesian methods permitting information sharing across subtrials have been proposed. With the increasing interest of implementing randomised basket trials, information borrowing could be exploited in two ways; considering the commensurability of either the treatment effects or the outcomes specific to each of the treatment groups between the subtrials. In this article, we extend a previous analysis model based on distributional discrepancy for borrowing over the subtrial treatment effects ('treatment effect borrowing', TEB) to borrowing over the subtrial groupwise responses ('treatment response borrowing', TRB). Simulation results demonstrate that both modelling strategies provide substantial gains over an approach with no borrowing. TRB outperforms TEB especially when subtrial sample sizes are small on all operational characteristics, while the latter has considerable gains in performance over TRB when subtrial sample sizes are large, or the treatment effects and groupwise mean responses are noticeably heterogeneous across subtrials. Further, we notice that TRB, and TEB can potentially lead to different conclusions in the analysis of real data.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25176973": "In the genomics era, our main goal should be to identify large and meaningful differences in small, molecularly selected groups of patients.

There is an urgent need to streamline the development of new compounds, with the aim of identifying \"trials designed to learn\", which could lead to subsequent \"trials designed to conclude\". Basket trials are often viewed as parallel phase II trials within the same entity, designed on the basis of a common denominator, which can be a molecular alteration(s). Most basket trials are histology-independent and aberration-specific clinical trials. Umbrella trials are built on a centrally performed molecular portrait and molecularly selected cohorts with matched drugs, and can include patients' randomisation and strategy validation.

Basket- and integrated protocol designs are two of these new strategies and have been applied in a handful oncologic trials. We have taken the concept outside the realm of oncology and report about a first-in-human integrated protocol design that facilitates the transition from phase Ia in healthy volunteers to phase Ib in patients with rare complement-mediated disorders driven by the classical pathway.\nRESULTS: We have been conducting a prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled first-in-human study with TNT009, which is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against the C1s subunit of human complement component C1. The trial consisted of three subparts, including normal healthy volunteers (part one and two) and a single cohort of patients in part three. Patients suffered from various complement-mediated diseases sharing the same pathophysiological mechanism, i.e. bullous pemphigoid, antibody-mediated rejection of organ transplants, cold agglutinin disease and warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Primary objective of the trial has been to evaluate the safety and tolerability of TNT009 in humans.\nCONCLUSIONS: This trial provides probably the first example that basket trials may not be limited to single genetic aberrations, which is overly restrictive, but our trial design demonstrates that pathway specificity is a viable paradigm for defining baskets. This will hopefully serve as a role model that could benefit other innovative drug development programs targeting rare diseases.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35917296": "This article discusses and compares statistical designs of basket trial, from both frequentist and Bayesian perspectives. Baskets trials are used in oncology to study interventions that are developed to target a specific feature (often genetic alteration or immune phenotype) that is observed across multiple tissue types and/or tumor histologies. Patient heterogeneity has become pivotal to the development of non-cytotoxic treatment strategies. Treatment targets are often rare and exist among several histologies, making prospective clinical inquiry challenging for individual tumor types. More generally, basket trials are a type of master protocol often used for label expansion. Master protocol is used to refer to designs that accommodates multiple targets, multiple treatments, or both within one overarching protocol. For the purpose of making sequential decisions about treatment futility, Simon's two-stage design is often embedded within master protocols. In basket trials, this frequentist design is often applied to independent evaluations of tumor histologies and/or indications. In the tumor agnostic setting, rarer indications may fail to reach the sample size needed for even the first evaluation for futility. With recent innovations in Bayesian methods, it is possible to evaluate for futility with smaller sample sizes, even for rarer indications. Novel Bayesian methodology for a sequential basket trial design based on predictive probability is introduced. The Bayesian predictive probability designs allow interim analyses with any desired frequency, including continual assessments after each patient observed. The sequential design is compared with and without Bayesian methods for sharing information among a collection of discrete, and potentially non-exchangeable tumor types. Bayesian designs are compared with Simon's two-stage minimax design.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35358718": "A basket trial investigates the effects of one drug on multiple tumor indications. To discontinue potentially inactive indications early, an interim futility analysis is usually conducted for each indication individually once it reaches the pre-specified sample size. As enrollment rates vary among indications, the futility decisions for slow-enrolling indications could be made much later than other fast-enrolling indications, which could delay the overall decision for the trial significantly. To accelerate the futility decision in early-stage exploratory basket trials and potentially reallocate resources to other compounds earlier while still controlling the global type-I and type-II errors, we propose an optimal two-stage basket trial design with one aggregated futility analysis by aggregating (e.g., pooling) all indications together. The total sample size across all indications is pre-specified for the futility analysis, while the sample size per indication can be adapted to the enrollment rate. The final analysis is performed using the pruning and pooling approach (Chen et al. 2016). The design parameters are optimized by minimizing the expected total sample size under the null hypothesis, while explicitly controlling the global type-I and the type-II error rates.

In this situation, it is appealing to test hypotheses of both non-inferiority overall and superiority on certain baskets. The challenge is designing a confirmatory study efficient to address multiple questions in one trial. A two-stage adaptive design is proposed to test the non-inferiority hypothesis at the interim stage, followed by pruning and pooling before testing a superiority hypothesis at the final stage. Such a design enables an efficient and novel registration pathway, including an early claim of non-inferiority followed by a potential label extension with superiority on certain baskets and an improved benefit-risk profile demonstrated by longer term efficacy and safety data. Operating characteristics of this design are examined by simulation studies, and its appealing features make it ready for use in a confirmatory setting, especially in emerging markets, where both the need and the possibility for efficient use of resources may be the greatest.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34485534": "Tumor immunotherapy is the fourth therapy after surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. It has made great breakthroughs in the treatment of some epithelial tumors and hematological tumors.

The microbiota may affect tumor immunity by regulating the host immune system and tumor microenvironment. Some bacteria help fight tumors by activating immunity, while some bacteria mediate immunosuppression to help cancer cells escape from the immune system. More and more studies have revealed that the effects and complications of tumor immunotherapy are related to the composition of the gut microbiota. The composition of the intestinal microbiota that is sensitive to treatment or prone to adverse reactions has certain characteristics. These characteristics may be used as biomarkers to predict the prognosis of immunotherapy and may also be developed as \"immune potentiators\" to assist immunotherapy.

The poor response to immunotherapy in patients treated with antibiotics supports this influential role of the microbiota.

A better understanding of the taxonomy of the species involved and of the mechanisms of action has since been achieved. Defined bacterial species have been shown to promote an improved response to immune-checkpoint inhibitors by producing different products or metabolites.

Thus, interest in modulating the microbiota composition to improve patient responsiveness to therapy has been mounting. Clinical proof-of-concept studies have demonstrated that faecal microbiota transplantation or dietary interventions might be utilized clinically to improve the success rate of immunotherapy in patients with cancer.

While research in the field of cancer immunotherapy has provided an improved understanding of the interaction with the gastrointestinal microbiome, the significance of the tumor-associated microbiome has only recently been grasped. This article provides a state-of-the-art review about the tumor-associated microbiome and sheds light on how local tumor microbiota shapes anticancer immunity and influences checkpoint immunotherapy outcome. The direct route of interaction between cancer cells, immune cells, and microbiota in the tumor microenvironment is emphasized and advocates a focus on the tumor-associated microbiome in addition to the spatially separated gut compartment. Since the mechanisms underlying checkpoint immunotherapy modulation by tumor-associated microbiota remain largely elusive, future research should dissect the pathways involved and outline strategies to therapeutically modulate microbes and their products within the tumor microenvironment.

Indeed, most of the compounds extracted from HMs can be metabolized into specific molecules by host microbiota and affect pharmacokinetics and toxicity. Moreover, HMs modulate the constitution of host intestinal microbiota to maintain a healthy gut ecology. Dietary interventions also show great efficacy in treating some refractory diseases, and the commensal microbiota potentially has significant implications for the high inter-individual differences observed in such responses. Herein, we mainly discuss the contribution of the intestinal microbiota to high inter-individual differences in response to HMs and TCMs, and especially the already known metabolites of the HMs produced by the intestinal microbiota. The contribution of commensal microbiota to the inter-individual differences in response to dietary therapy is also briefly discussed. This review highlights the significance of intestinal microbiota-associated metabolites to the efficiency of HMs and dietary interventions. Our review may help further identify the mechanisms leading to the inter-individual differences in the effectiveness of HM and dietary intervention from the perspective of their interactions with the intestinal microbiota.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29425062": "Microbiota is a group of microbes coexisting and co-evolving with the immune system in the host body for millions of years. There are mutual interaction between microbiota and the immune system. Immune cells can shape the populations of microbiota in the gut of animals and humans, and the presence of microbiota and the microbial products can regulate the development and function of the immune cells in the host. Although microbiota resides mainly at the mucosa, the effect of microbiota on the immune system can be both local at the mucosa and systemic through the whole body. At the mucosal sites, the presences of microbiota and microbial products have a direct effect on the immune cells. Microbiota induces production of effectors from immune cells, such as cytokines and inflammatory factors, influencing the further development and function of the immune cells. Experimental data have shown that microbial products can influence the activity of some key factors in signaling pathways. At the nonmucosal sites, such as the bone marrow, peripheral lymph nodes, and spleen, microbiota can also regulate the development and function of the immune cells via several mechanisms in mice, such as introduction of chromatin-level changes through histone acetylation and DNA methylation. Given the important effect of microbiota on the immune system, many immunotherapies that are mediated by immune system rely on gut microbiota. Thus, the study of how microbiota influences immune system bring a potential therapy prospect in preventing and treating diseases.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29494275": "Although immunotherapy has been remarkably effective across multiple cancer types, there continues to be a significant number of non-responding patients.

While the investigations all exhibit interesting results and conclusions, we find little congruence in the specific bacteria that were found favorable for antitumor responses. It is unclear whether the inconsistencies are due to differential approaches in study design (pre-clinical or clinical subjects, anti-CTLA-4 Ab or anti-PD-1 Ab), experimental methods and measurements (metagenomics sequencing and clustering variations) or subject population dynamics (differential cancer types and baseline characteristics). Moreover, we note studies regarding particular bacterial commensals and autoimmune diseases, which challenge findings from these investigations. We conclude that with the current research, clinical investigators can appreciate the critical role of gut microbiota in mediating immunostimulant response.

Immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has dramatically changed the landscape of treatment for many advanced cancers, but CRC still exhibits suboptimal response to immunotherapy. The gut microbiota can affect both anti-tumor and pro-tumor immune responses, and further modulate the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy, particularly in the context of therapy with ICIs. Therefore, a deeper understanding of how the gut microbiota modulates immune responses is crucial to improve the outcomes of CRC patients receiving immunotherapy and to overcome resistance in nonresponders. The present review aims to describe the relationship between the gut microbiota, CRC, and antitumor immune responses, with a particular focus on key studies and recent findings on the effect of the gut microbiota on the antitumor immune activity. We also discuss the potential mechanisms by which the gut microbiota influences host antitumor immune responses as well as the prospective role of intestinal flora in CRC treatment.

We therefore performed an actual literature survey on the role of the gut microbiota composition and the effects of its modification during immunotherapy of cancer patients. The included 23 studies published in the past 10 years revealed that both, distinct bacterial species and genera including Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Bifidobacterium, respectively, enhanced distinct immunotherapy responses following PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4 blockage, for instance, resulting in a better clinical outcome of cancer patients. Conversely, a high intestinal abundance of Bacteroidetes and Fusobacterium species correlated with a less efficient immunotherapy resulting in shorter progress-free survival outcomes.

Gut dysbiosis is involved in carcinogenesis and the progression of lung cancer through genotoxicity, systemic inflammation, and defective immunosurveillance. In addition, the gut microbiome harbors the potential to be a novel biomarker for predicting sensitivity and adverse reactions to immunotherapy in patients with lung cancer. Probiotics and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) can enhance the efficacy and depress the\u00a0toxicity of immune checkpoint inhibitors by regulating the gut microbiota. Although current studies have found that gut microbiota closely participates in the development and immunotherapy of lung cancer, the mechanisms require further investigation.

Recently, studies have indicated that ginsenoside intervention has beneficial metabolic effects on obesity and its complications because it allows for the correction of gut microbiota dysbiosis and regulates the secretion of related endogenous metabolites. In this review, we summarize the role of gut microbiota in the pathogenetic process of obesity, and explore the mechanism of ginsenosides for ameliorating obesity, which can modulate the composition of gut microbiota by improving the metabolism of intestinal endogenous substances and alleviating the level of inflammation.

There have been significant efforts to identify biomarkers that can predict response and toxicities related to immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICPI) therapy. Despite these advances, it has been challenging to tease out why a subset of patients benefit more than others or why certain patients experience immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Although the immune-modulating properties of the human gut bacterial ecosystem are yet to be fully elucidated, there has been growing interest in evaluating the role of the gut microbiome in shaping the therapeutic response to cancer immunotherapy. Considerable research efforts are currently directed to utilizing metagenomic and metabolic profiling of stool microbiota in patients on ICPI-based therapies. Dysbiosis or loss of microbial diversity has been associated with a poor treatment response to ICPIs and worse survival outcomes in cancer patients. Emerging data have shown that certain bacterial strains, such as Faecalibacterium that confer sensitivity to ICPI, also have a higher propensity to increase the risk of irAEs. Additionally, the microbiome can modulate the local immune response at the intestinal interface and influence the trafficking of bacterial peptide primed T-cells distally, influencing the toxicity patterns to ICPI. Antibiotic or diet induced alterations in composition of the microbiome can also indirectly alter the production of certain bacterial metabolites such as deoxycholate and short chain fatty acids that can influence the anti-tumor tolerogenesis.

In addition, recent studies have shown that radiotherapy and ICBs act synergistically, with radiotherapy stimulating the immune system that is activated by ICBs. However, both treatments are also associated with severe toxicity and efficacy issues, which can lead to temporary or permanent discontinuation of these treatment programs. There's growing evidence pointing to the gut microbiome playing a role in these issues. Some microorganisms seem to contribute to radiotherapy-associated toxicity and hinder ICB efficacy, while others seem to reduce radiotherapy-associated toxicity or enhance ICB efficacy. Consequently, fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been applied to reduce radio- and immunotherapy-related toxicity and enhance their efficacies.

Microbiota-induced inflammation possibly contributes to tumor growth and cancer development. Microbiota-derived metabolites can also be converted to carcinogenic agents related to genetic mutations and DNA damage in organs such as the colon. However, other attributes of microbiota, such as greater diversity and specific bacterial species and their metabolites, are linked to better clinical outcomes and potentially improved anti-tumor immunity.

Evidence has emerged that the intestinal microbiome can modulate outcomes to ICI therapies via two major mechanisms, including those that are antigen-specific and those that are antigen-independent. Antigen-specific mechanisms occur when epitopes are shared between microbial and tumor antigens that could enhance, or, alternatively, reduce anti-tumor immune responses via cross-reactive adaptive immune cells.

The human DPH1 syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder associated with developmental delay, abnormal head circumference (microcephaly or macrocephaly), short stature, and congenital heart disease. It is defined by variants with reduced functionality of the DPH1 gene\u00a0observed so far predominantly in consanguineous homozygous patients carrying identical mutant alleles of DPH1. Here we report a child with a very similar phenotype carrying biallelic variants of the human DPH2. The gene products\u00a0DPH1 and DPH2 are components of a heterodimeric enzyme complex that mediates the first step of the posttranslational diphthamide modification on the nonredundant eukaryotic translation elongation factor 2 (eEF2). Diphthamide deficiency was shown to reduce the accuracy of ribosomal protein biosynthesis. Both DPH2 variants described here severely impair diphthamide biosynthesis as demonstrated in human and yeast cells.

The primary outcome was survival with a favorable functional outcome at 6 months after injury, as assessed with the use of the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOS-E). Levels on the GOS-E range from 1 (death) to 8 (\"upper good recovery\" [no injury-related problems]). We defined survival with a favorable functional outcome as a GOS-E level of 5 (\"lower moderate disability\") or higher. Secondary outcomes included death from any cause within 28 days and within 6 months after injury.\nRESULTS: A total of 1310 patients were recruited by 15 emergency medical services in Australia, New Zealand, and Germany. Of these patients, 661 were assigned to receive tranexamic acid, and 646 were assigned to receive placebo; the trial-group assignment was unknown for 3 patients. Survival with a favorable functional outcome at 6 months occurred in 307 of 572 patients (53.7%) in the tranexamic acid group and in 299 of 559 (53.5%) in the placebo group (risk ratio, 1.00; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.90 to 1.12; P\u2009=\u20090.95).

Sodium leak channel (NALCN) is widely expressed in the central nervous system and regulates neuronal excitability. In this study, chemogenetic manipulation was used to explore the association between the activity of PBL glutamatergic neurons and pain thresholds. Complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) was used to construct an inflammatory pain model in mice. Pain behaviour was tested using von Frey filaments and Hargreaves tests. Local field potential (LFP) was used to record the activity of PBL glutamatergic neurons. Gene knockdown techniques were used to investigate the role of NALCN in inflammatory pain. We further explored the downstream projections of PBL using cis-trans-synaptic tracer virus. The results showed that chemogenetic inhibition of PBL glutamatergic neurons increased pain thresholds in mice, whereas chemogenetic activation produced the opposite results. CFA plantar modelling increased the number of C-Fos protein and NALCN expression in PBL glutamatergic neurons. Knockdown of NALCN in PBL glutamatergic neurons alleviated CFA-induced pain. CFA injection induced C-Fos protein expression in central nucleus amygdala (CeA) neurons, which was suppressed by NALCN knockdown in PBL glutamatergic neurons.

In situ hybridization revealed NALCN RNA in all DANs, with lower abundance in medial ventral tegmental area (VTA) relative to substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). Despite lower relative abundance of NALCN, we found that acute pharmacological blockade of NALCN in medial VTA DANs slowed pacemaking by 49.08%. We also examined the electrophysiological properties of projection-defined VTA DAN subpopulations identified by retrograde labeling. Inhibition of NALCN reduced pacemaking in DANs projecting to medial nucleus accumbens (NAc) and others projecting to lateral NAc by 70.74% and 31.98%, respectively, suggesting that NALCN is a primary driver of pacemaking in VTA DANs. In SNc DANs, potentiating NALCN by lowering extracellular calcium concentration speeded pacemaking in wildtype but not NALCN conditional knockout mice, demonstrating functional presence of NALCN. In contrast to VTA DANs, however, pacemaking in SNc DANs was unaffected by inhibition of NALCN. Instead, we found that inhibition of NALCN increased the gain of frequency-current plots at firing frequencies slower than spontaneous firing. Similarly, inhibition of the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) conductance increased gain but had little effect on pacemaking. Interestingly, simultaneous inhibition of NALCN and HCN resulted in significant reduction in pacemaker rate. Thus, we found NALCN makes substantial contributions to driving pacemaking in VTA DAN subpopulations. In SNc DANs, NALCN is not critical for pacemaking but inhibition of NALCN makes cells more sensitive to hyperpolarizing stimuli.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Pacemaking in midbrain dopaminergic neurons (DAN) relies on multiple subthreshold conductances, including a sodium leak. Whether the sodium leak channel, NALCN, contributes to pacemaking in DANs located in the VTA and the SNc has not yet been determined. Using electrophysiology and pharmacology, we show that NALCN plays a prominent role in driving pacemaking in projection-defined VTA DAN subpopulations. By contrast, pacemaking in SNc neurons does not rely on NALCN. Instead, the presence of NALCN regulates the excitability of SNc DANs by reducing the gain of the neuron's response to inhibitory stimuli.

In RTN neurons, Nalcn expression correlated with higher action potential discharge over a more alkalized range of activity; shRNA-mediated depletion of Nalcn hyperpolarized RTN neurons, and reduced leak Na(+) current and firing rate. Nalcn depletion also decreased RTN neuron activation by the neuropeptide, substance P, without affecting pH-sensitive background K(+) currents or activation by a cotransmitter, serotonin. In vivo, RTN-specific knockdown of Nalcn reduced CO2-evoked neuronal activation and breathing; hypoxic hyperventilation was unchanged. Thus, Nalcn regulates RTN neuronal excitability and stimulation by CO2, independent of direct pH sensing, potentially contributing to respiratory effects of Nalcn mutations; transmitter modulation of Nalcn may underlie state-dependent changes in breathing and respiratory chemosensitivity.\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Breathing is an essential, enduring rhythmic motor activity orchestrated by dedicated brainstem circuits that require tonic excitatory drive for their persistent function.

Electrophysiological studies combined with molecular analysis indicate that enhanced NALCN activities contribute to hyperexcitability in PRMT7-/- neurons. PRMT7 depletion in HEK293T cells increases NALCN activity by shifting the dose-response curve of NALCN inhibition by [Ca2+]<sub>e</sub> without affecting NALCN protein levels. In vitro methylation studies show that PRMT7 methylates a highly conserved Arg1653 of the NALCN gene located in the carboxy-terminal region that is implicated in CaSR-mediated regulation.

Importantly, NALCN mutations lead to complex neurodevelopmental syndromes, including infantile hypotonia with psychomotor retardation and characteristic facies (IHPRF) and congenital contractures of limbs and face, hypotonia and developmental delay (CLIFAHDD), which are recessively and dominantly inherited, respectively. Unfortunately, the biophysical properties of NALCN are still largely unknown to date, as well as the functional consequences of both IHPRF and CLIFAHDD mutations on NALCN current. Here we have set-up the heterologous expression of NALCN in the neuronal cell line NG108-15 to investigate the electrophysiological properties of NALCN carrying representative IHPRF and CLIFAHDD mutations. Several original properties of the wild-type (wt) NALCN current were retrieved: mainly carried by external Na+, blocked by Gd3+, insensitive to TTX and potentiated by low external Ca2+ concentration. However, we found that this current displays a time-dependent inactivation in the -80/-40 mV range of membrane potential, and a non linear current-voltage relationship indicative of voltage sensitivity. Importantly, no detectable current was recorded with the IHPRF missense mutation p.Trp1287Leu (W1287L), while the CLIFAHDD mutants, p.Leu509Ser (L509S) and p.Tyr578Ser (Y578S), showed higher current densities and slower inactivation, compared to wt NALCN current. This study reveals that heterologous expression of NALCN channel can be achieved in the neuronal cell line NG108-15 to study the electrophysiological properties of wt and mutants. From our results, we conclude that IHPRF and CLIFAHDD missense mutations are loss- and gain-of-function variants, respectively.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32494638": "The sodium leak channel (NALCN) is essential for survival in mammals: NALCN mutations are life-threatening in humans and knockout is lethal in mice. However, the basic functional and pharmacological properties of NALCN have remained elusive. Here, we found that robust function of NALCN in heterologous systems requires co-expression of UNC79, UNC80, and FAM155A. The resulting NALCN channel complex is constitutively active and conducts monovalent cations but is blocked by physiological concentrations of extracellular divalent cations. Our data support the notion that NALCN is directly responsible for the increased excitability observed in a variety of neurons in reduced extracellular Ca2+. Despite the smaller number of voltage-sensing residues in NALCN, the constitutive activity is modulated by voltage, suggesting that voltage-sensing domains can give rise to a broader range of gating phenotypes than previously anticipated. Our work points toward formerly unknown contributions of NALCN to neuronal excitability and opens avenues for pharmacological targeting.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33766679": "Neuropathic pain affects up to 10 % of the total population and no specific target is ideal for therapeutic need.

Here, we show that increases of NALCN expression and function in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and dorsal spinal cord contribute to chronic constriction injury (CCI)-induced neuropathic pain in rodents. NALCN current and neuronal excitability in acutely isolated DRG neurons and spinal cord slices of rats were increased after CCI which were decreased to normal levels by NALCN-siRNA. Accordingly, pain-related symptoms were significantly alleviated by NALCN-siRNA-mediated NALCN knockdown and completely prevented by NALCN-shRNA-mediated NALCN knockdown in rats or by conditional NALCN knockout in mice.

The structure reveals detailed interactions between NALCN and the extracellular cysteine-rich domain of FAM155A. We find that the non-canonical architecture of NALCN selectivity filter dictates its sodium selectivity and calcium block, and that the asymmetric arrangement of two functional voltage sensors confers the modulation by membrane potential.

Sodium leak channels (NALCN) play a key role in rhythmic behaviors by helping set, or subtly changing neuronal resting potential. The full complexity of these newly described channels is just beginning to be appreciated, however. NALCN channels can associate with numerous subunits in different tissues and can be activated by several different peptides and second messengers. We recently showed that NALCN channels are closely related to fungal calcium channels, which they functionally resemble. Here, we use this relationship to predict a family of NALCN-associated proteins in animals on the basis of homology with the yeast protein Mid1, the subunit of the yeast calcium channel. These proteins all share a cysteine-rich region that is necessary for Mid1 function in yeast. We validate this predicted association by showing that the Mid1 homolog in Drosophila, encoded by the CG33988 gene, is coordinately expressed with NALCN, and that knockdown of either protein creates identical phenotypes in several behaviors associated with NALCN function. The relationship between Mid1 and leak channels has therefore persisted over a billion years of evolution, despite drastic changes to both proteins and the organisms in which they exist.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24075186": "Sodium leak channel, nonselective (NALCN) is a voltage-independent and cation-nonselective channel that is mainly responsible for the leaky sodium transport across neuronal membranes and controls neuronal excitability.

Unlike any of the other 20 family members, NALCN forms a voltage-independent, nonselective cation channel. NALCN mutant mice have a severely disrupted respiratory rhythm and die within 24 hours of birth. Brain stem-spinal cord recordings reveal reduced neuronal firing. The TTX- and Cs(+)-resistant background Na(+) leak current is absent in the mutant hippocampal neurons.

This current is primarily permeant to sodium ions, independent of intracellular calcium stores and G proteins but dependent on Src activation, and resistant to TTX. The current is recapitulated by co-expression of NALCN and M3R in human embryonic kidney-293 cells and in Xenopus oocytes. We also show that NALCN and M3R belong to the same protein complex, involving the intracellular I-II loop of NALCN and the intracellular i3 loop of M3R.

Neuronal hyperexcitability and/or sensitization of the primary nociceptive neurons in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and spinal dorsal horn are critical to the development and maintenance of inflammatory pain. The sodium leak channel (NALCN), a non-selective cation channel, mediates the background Na+ leak conductance and controls neuronal excitability. It is unknown whether abnormal activity of NALCN mediates the pathological process of inflammatory pain. Complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) was injected into the left footpad of rats to induce inflammatory pain. The thresholds of mechanical and thermal sensation and spontaneous pain behaviors were assessed. The expression of NALCN in DRG and spinal dorsal cord was measured. NALCN currents and the contribution of NALCN to neuronal excitability in the DRG and spinal dorsal cord were recorded using whole-cell patch-clamping recording. NALCN was abundantly expressed in neurons of the DRG and spinal dorsal cord. In acutely isolated DRG neurons and spinal cord slices from rats with CFA-induced inflammatory pain, NALCN currents and neuronal excitability were increased. Subsequently, intrathecal and sciatic nerve injection of NALCN-small interfering RNA (siRNA) decreased NALCN mRNA and reverted NALCN currents to normal levels, and then reduced CFA-induced neuronal excitability and alleviated pain symptoms. Furthermore, pain-related symptoms were significantly prevented by the NALCN-shRNA-mediated NALCN knockdown in DRG and spinal cord. Therefore, increased expression and activity of NALCN contributed to neuronal sensitization in CFA-induced inflammatory pain.

We identify the Na+ leak channel, NALCN, which is overexpressed in metastatic prostate cancer, as a major initiator and regulator of Ca2+ oscillations required for invadopodia formation. Indeed, NALCN-mediated Na+ influx into cancer cells maintains intracellular Ca2+ oscillations via a specific chain of ion transport proteins including plasmalemmal and mitochondrial Na+ /Ca2+ exchangers, SERCA and store-operated channels. This signaling cascade promotes activity of the NACLN-colocalized proto-oncogene Src kinase, actin remodeling and secretion of proteolytic enzymes, thus increasing cancer cell invasive potential and metastatic lesions in vivo.

Recently we found that NCA-1 and NCA-2 are activated by a signal transduction pathway acting downstream of the heterotrimeric G protein Gq and the small GTPase Rho. Through a forward genetic screen, here we identify the GPCR kinase GRK-2 as a new player affecting signaling through the Gq-Rho-NCA pathway. Using structure-function analysis, we find that the GPCR phosphorylation and membrane association domains of GRK-2 are required for its function. Genetic epistasis experiments suggest that GRK-2 acts on the D2-like dopamine receptor DOP-3 to inhibit Go signaling and positively modulate NCA-1 and NCA-2 activity. Through cell-specific rescuing experiments, we find that GRK-2 and DOP-3 act in premotor interneurons to modulate NCA channel function.

PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and Embase, were reviewed for citations from their inception to December 31, 2021. This review revealed that transgender and gender-diverse people had a high prevalence of tobacco consumption and alcohol use and high rates of infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) and HIV. Transgender and gender-diverse individuals were less likely to adhere to cancer screening programs and had a higher incidence of HIV- and HPV-associated cancers. Social and economic determinants seemed to drive these disparities in risk factors and outcomes. A lack of knowledge about gender minorities' health needs among health care practitioners was evidenced, and it represented a major hurdle to cancer prevention, care, and survivorship for transgender and gender-diverse individuals. Discrimination, discomfort caused by gender-labeled oncological services, stigma, and lack of cultural sensitivity of health care practitioners were other barriers met by transgender and gender-diverse persons in the oncology setting.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings suggest that transgender and gender-diverse peoples' needs in the cancer care continuum are not optimally addressed.

Breast cancer is leading cancer in women, worldwide, accounting for 25% of all cases. Annual incidence rates increased significantly in all countries and age groups. The occurrence of breast cancer is rare in transgender population. As they have very limited access to medical care, it is much less likely to pursue breast cancer screening than in other individuals not identified as transgender.\nREVIEW OF THE CASES FROM LITERATURE: Up to date, only 13 cases of the breast cancer transsexuals (female to male) have been reported in six published papers worldwide. Histological examination of the breast tumor in female-to-male transgender showed progesterone/estrogen-positive invasive ductal carcinoma.\nDISCUSSION: Gender identity describes a person's inherent sense of being a woman, man, or of neither gender, whereas sexual orientation refers to how people identify their physical and emotional attraction to others. Gender reassignment surgery, as series of complex surgical genital and non-genital procedures, is recognized as the most effective treatment for patients with gender dysphoria. The two main principles of hormone therapy for transgender patients are to reduce endogenous hormone levels and their associated sex characteristics and replace them with hormones of the preferred sex. Breast cancer infrequently occurs in transgender patients. Even breast core biopsies can be difficult for interpreting after changes in breast tissue in female-to-male transsexuals following gender reassignment.\nCONCLUSION: Reviewing the literature, so many different data concerning probability of breast cancer in sexual minority can be found. Breast cancer screening program should be offered to all transgender individuals according to national guidelines. Very important is to take into consideration a transgender person's natal and surgical anatomy, unique clinical concerns for depression and anxiety, risk of suicide together with risk factors including experiences of harassment or physical or sexual violence, low education level, and unemployment. Understanding the need for mammography in these often marginalized groups is very important in addressing breast cancer disparities despite differences in insurance coverage in some countries and greater concern for the cancer of the breast in residual breast tissue. The best screening rule, ever, for breast cancer in male transsexuals and other similar population should be, besides surgical history and hormonal status, \"Screen Now, Screen Regularly and Screen What You Have.\"", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31562693": "Transgender individuals are often their own health advocates, especially if seeking hormone therapies and gender-affirmation surgeries.

A survey evaluated comfort with relevant vocabulary terms and performance on written case vignettes to approximate how cancer genetic counselors would facilitate conversations with transgender patients about cancer risks. Conclusions drawn in this study are representative of this subpopulation, which is skewed toward a younger population. Mean similarity between responses and predetermined correct answers on the case vignettes was 78.5%. A majority of participants endorsed wanting more education on implications of transgender identity on cancer risk assessment, a need underscored by some participants reporting their discomfort asking about gender pronouns.

We describe a series of 9 MtF transgender patients who underwent prostate tissue sampling and highlight histopathologic features and challenges related to pathologic interpretation of prostate tissue in this patient population. Seven of 9 total patients were diagnosed with prostate cancer and all had elevated prostate-specific antigen at the time of diagnosis. Three of the 7 patients diagnosed with prostate cancer had received different types of hormone therapy for gender affirmation before the diagnosis of prostate cancer, and in all 3 of these patients, there was histologic evidence of hormone therapy effect in both benign prostate tissue and/or the adenocarcinoma. The 2 patients with benign prostate tissue underwent transurethral resection for lower urinary tract symptoms and were previously on hormone therapy for gender affirmation. Both of these specimens showed diffuse glandular atrophy and basal cell hyperplasia, indicative of hormone therapy effect on benign prostatic tissue. In the patients diagnosed with prostate cancer, a spectrum of grades was observed, ranging from Grade Group 1 to Grade Group 5. Four patients underwent radical prostatectomy, with 2 cases showing extraprostatic extension and Grade Group 5 prostatic adenocarcinoma, and 2 showing Grade Group 2 prostatic adenocarcinoma. Three of the 4 patients who underwent radical prostatectomy had received gender-affirming hormone therapy before surgery, and all 3 of these specimens showed hormone therapy effect in non-neoplastic prostate tissue and focal hormone therapy effect in prostatic adenocarcinoma. The presence of areas of viable carcinoma without hormone therapy effect enabled the assignment of a Gleason score and Grade Group in these 3 cases. Hormone therapy administered for gender identity affirmation induces histopathologic changes to both benign prostate tissue (nonkeratinizing squamous metaplasia, diffuse atrophy, basal cell hyperplasia, and stromal dominance with decreased numbers of glands) and prostatic adenocarcinoma (nuclear pyknosis, atrophy, cytoplasmic vacuolization, and architectural patterns that would qualify for Gleason 4 and 5 in the absence of hormone therapy effect) that have been traditionally seen in cis-male prostate cancer patients receiving hormone therapy. In the absence of hormone therapy, the morphology of prostatic adenocarcinoma in transgender patients shows classic morphologic features similar to those seen in cis-male patients not on hormone therapy. Prostate cancer with hormone therapy effect may not only be histologically quite subtle and may be overlooked if not suspected, but also should not be assigned a Gleason score because the Gleason score would substantially overstate its biologic potential. Therefore, similar to cis-male patients who have received androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer, transgender patients on hormone therapy for gender affirmation may be at risk for both underrecognition and over-grading of prostate cancer, particularly if the pathologist is not aware of the clinical history.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34157213": "OBJECTIVE: To review of the existing literature, current guidelines and standard of practice related to prostate cancer in transgender women, as the transgender population share many of the same healthcare needs as their cisgender counterparts, but may have additional specialist needs.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a non-systematic review of the literature, current guidelines and standard of practice related to prostate cancer in transgender women.\nRESULTS: Our search revealed 10 case reports of prostate cancer in transgender women, four specialist opinion papers, six cohort studies, and four systematic reviews. The information in these publications were assimilated to produce a review of prostate cancer in transgender women.\nCONCLUSION: The risk of prostate cancer in transgender women who are not on gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) or who have not had gender-affirming surgery (GAS) and gender non-conforming individuals (who may never commence GAHT or have GAS) is the same as that in the cis male population. In these patients, healthcare professionals need to be able to discuss screening, diagnostic and treatment options considering future wishes for gender-affirming treatment. Prostate cancer incidence in transgender women on GAHT or following GAS is lower than age-matched cis-male counterparts, but diagnosis and treatment is more nuanced. The present review discusses the existing literature about development and incidence of prostate cancer in this population, and makes recommendations about screening, the usefulness of diagnostic tools e.g. prostate-specific antigen and magnetic resonance imaging, and considerations when formulating treatment.

The transgender community has not been well understood by medical and mental health fields. As such, this marginalized and vulnerable community faces multiple barriers to receiving health maintenance and specialized care, both at the community and patient-specific level. Many transgender individuals undergo some form of transition to the gender that matches their gender identity. Transition efforts look different for each patient because gender and gender identity occur along a continuum. Transition may include social, hormonal, and/or surgical components. As providers are caring for transgender patients, it is imperative to understand where a patient is in their gender transition and how hormonal and/or surgical therapies affect their cancer risk and screening.

TT for one patient was unknown. TT for >12 months was associated with seven histopathological features. Longer duration of TT was significantly associated with higher degrees of lobular atrophy (p\u2009<\u20090.001). This relationship remained significant after accounting for age at surgery, ethnicity, body mass index, and presurgical oophorectomy (adjusted p\u2009<\u20090.001).

Our study included 2,307 male-to-female (MtF) transsexual persons undergoing androgen deprivation and estrogen administration (52,370 person-years of exposure), and 795 female-to-male (FtM) subjects receiving testosterone (15,974 total years of exposure).\nRESULTS: Among MtF individuals one case was encountered, as well as a probable but not proven second case. The estimated rate of 4.1 per 100,000 person-years (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.8-13.0) was lower than expected if these two cases are regarded as female breast cancer, but within expectations if viewed as male breast cancer. In FtM subjects, who were younger and had shorter exposure to cross-sex hormones compared with the MtF group, one breast cancer case occurred. This translated into a rate of 5.9 per 100,000 person-years (95% CI: 0.5-27.4), again lower than expected for female breast cancer but within expected norms for male breast cancer.\nCONCLUSIONS: The number of people studied and duration of hormone exposure are limited but it would appear that cross-sex hormone administration does not increase the risk of breast cancer development, in either MtF or FtM transsexual individuals.

Recently, the PCSK9Is (proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin 9 inhibitors) have become available as a potent lipid-lowering class with potentially less hemorrhagic propensity.\nMETHODS: We performed a systematic comparative meta-analysis assessing HS rates across all completed statin and PCSK9I randomized clinical trials with treatment >3 months, following PRISMA guidelines. In addition to HS rates across all trials, causal relation was probed by evaluating for dose-response relationships by medication (low versus high medication dose/potency) and by presence and type of preceding brain vascular events at inception (none versus ischemic stroke/transient ischemic attack versus HS).\nRESULTS: The systematic review identified 36 statin randomized clinical trials (204\u2009918 patients) and 5 PCSK9I randomized clinical trials (76\u2009140 patients). Across all patient types and all medication doses/potencies, statins were associated with increased HS: relative risk 1.15, P=0.04; PCSK9Is were not (P=0.77). In the medication dose/potency analysis, higher dose/potency statins (7 trials, 62\u2009204 patients) were associated with magnified HS risk: relative risk, 1.53; P=0.002; higher dose/potency PCSK9Is (1 trial, 27\u2009564 patients) were not (P=0.99). In the type of index brain vascular injury analysis for statins (5 trials, 9772 patients), prior ischemic stroke/transient ischemic attack was associated with a magnified risk of HS: relative risk, 1.43; P=0.04; and index intracerebral hemorrhage was associated with an extremely high effect estimate of risk of recurrent HS: hazard ratio, 4.06. For PCSK9Is, prior ischemic stroke/transient ischemic attack (1 trial, 5337 patients) was not associated with increased HS risk (P=0.97).\nCONCLUSIONS: Statins increase the risk of HS in a medication dose- and type of index brain vascular injury-dependent manner; PCSK9Is do not increase HS risk.

Combinations of IMGN853 with carboplatin or doxorubicin resulted in synergistic antiproliferative effects in the IGROV-1 ovarian cancer cell line in vitro. IMGN853 potentiated the cytotoxic activity of carboplatin via growth arrest and augmented DNA damage; cell cycle perturbations were also observed in cells treated with the IMGN853/doxorubicin combination. These benefits translated into improved antitumor activity in patient-derived xenograft models in vivo in both the platinum-sensitive (IMGN853/carboplatin) and platinum-resistant (IMGN853/pegylated liposomal doxorubicin) settings.

Adverse events, tumor response, and progression-free survival (PFS) were determined.\nRESULTS: Eighteen patients were enrolled and dosed with combination therapy; thirteen continued with mirvetuximab soravtansine maintenance following carboplatin discontinuation. Mirvetuximab soravtansine dosing was escalated from 5 to 6\u202fmg/kg (adjusted ideal body weight) and carboplatin from AUC4 to AUC5. Adverse events were generally mild (\u2264 grade 2) with nausea, diarrhea, thrombocytopenia, blurred vision, and fatigue being the most common treatment-emergent toxicities. For all evaluable patients (n\u202f=\u202f17), the confirmed objective response rate (ORR) was 71%, including three complete responses and nine partial responses, and the median PFS was 15\u202fmonths. A median duration of response was not reached.\nCONCLUSION: These data demonstrate that mirvetuximab soravtansine combined with carboplatin is a well-tolerated and highly active regimen in recurrent, platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer.

In this phase 1 dose-escalation study, the authors investigated IMGN853 in patients with FR\u03b1-positive solid tumors.\nMETHODS: Patients received IMGN853 on day 1 of a 21-day cycle (once every 3 weeks dosing), with cycles repeated until patients experienced dose-limiting toxicity or progression. Dose escalation commenced in single-patient cohorts for the first 4 planned dose levels and then followed a standard 3 + 3 scheme. The primary objectives were to determine the maximum tolerated dose and the recommended phase 2 dose. Secondary objectives were to determine safety and tolerability, to characterize the pharmacokinetic profile, and to describe preliminary clinical activity.\nRESULTS: In total, 44 patients received treatment at doses escalating from 0.15 to 7.0 mg/kg. No meaningful drug accumulation was observed with the dosing regimen of once every 3 weeks. The most common treatment-related adverse events were fatigue, blurred vision, and diarrhea, the majority of which were grade 1 or 2. The dose-limiting toxicities observed were grade 3 hypophosphatemia (5.0 mg/kg) and grade 3 punctate keratitis (7.0 mg/kg). Two patients, both of whom were individuals with epithelial ovarian cancer, achieved confirmed tumor responses according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1, and each was a partial response.\nCONCLUSIONS: IMGN853 demonstrated a manageable safety profile and encouraging preliminary clinical activity, particularly in patients with ovarian cancer.

This study investigated the underlying mechanisms of ocular toxicity and evaluated primary prophylactic use of corticosteroid eye drops in patients receiving mirvetuximab soravtansine.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: Target expression in the human eye was determined by IHC. The ocular toxicity profile of mirvetuximab soravtansine was assessed preclinically using Dutch-Belted rabbits. In a phase I clinical study, patients with ovarian cancer were treated with 6 mg/kg mirvetuximab soravtansine intravenously once every 3 weeks, including one expansion cohort with corticosteroid eye drops administered daily for the first 10 days of each treatment cycle.\nRESULTS: FR\u03b1 expression was absent from human corneal tissues. Ocular abnormalities in the rabbit eye appeared phenotypically consistent with off-target effects on the cornea. Forty patients were enrolled in the expansion cohort. Reversible grade 1 or 2 blurred vision and keratopathy occurred in 16 (40%) and 12 (30%) patients, respectively; no grade 3/4 ocular events were observed.

Additional ADC are being evaluated in ovarian cancer including agents that target NaPiB2, Trop2, mesothelin, and MUC16 are in phase 1 clinical trials.\nSUMMARY: ADC bind antigens overexpressed on cancer cells and provide site-selective drug delivery, with the goal to increase therapeutic efficacy of cytotoxics while decreasing the off-target toxicity of the payloads. With appropriate antigen selection and adequate, measurable antigen threshold targets, these new agents may provide an improved strategy for overcoming resistance to standard chemotherapy in ovarian cancer.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28534292": "Antibody-drug-conjugates (ADCs) are an emerging class of biological therapeutics.

Six individuals (22%) did not have evaluable pre-treatment biopsies due to insufficient tumor cells. The concordance of FR\u03b1 expression in archival and biopsy tissues was 71%, and no major shifts in receptor expression were seen in matched pre- and post-treatment biopsy samples.

A 10-year retrospective case note review was undertaken. A total of 30 children were treated for acute epiglottitis in Sheffield Children's Hospital over that time period. A sharp decline in the number of cases was found after the vaccine was introduced. Most children presenting with the disease after October 1992 had not been vaccinated.

Streptococcus pneumoniae serotyping was performed using gel precipitation.\nRESULTS: The overall incidence of acute epiglottitis was 0.98 cases/100,000/year, compared with 4.5 cases/100,000/year before the vaccination programme. The incidence was reduced both in children and adults, compared with pre-vaccination values. However, the incidence of Streptococcus pneumoniae epiglottitis in adults increased from 0.1 to 0.28 cases/100,000/year over the same time period. The causative agent was Streptococcus pneumoniae in 10 adults. Nine of 10 pneumococcal strains could be serotyped.

Main outcome measures were age, gender, month/year of diagnosis, microbiology, airway management, ICU admissions, choice of antibiotics, length of hospital stay and major complications/mortality.\nRESULTS: Fifty-seven patients were identified (annual incidence 0.93/100.000). The mean age was 33.3 years (1-82). Childhood epiglottitis disappeared after introduction of Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) vaccination in 1989 but adult disease showed non-significant increase. In the pre-vaccination era Hib was the most common organism cultured but it has not been diagnosed in Iceland since 1991 and Streptococci are now the leading cause of epiglottitis.

Ninety percent of adults were observed without airway intervention. Major complications were rare and mortality was 0% in our series.\nCONCLUSION: There have been major changes in the epidemiology of epiglottitis in Iceland during the study period. Previously a childhood disease, epiglottitis has disappeared in children and is now almost exclusively found in adults. This can be attributed to widespread Hib vaccination, eliminating the major causative agent in children. The treatment of this life-threatening disease remains a challenge.

We aimed to identify the key networks recruited by the epileptic process of LGS using interictal 2-deoxy-2-(18F)fluoro-D-glucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG-PET).\nMETHODS: Group analysis of cerebral 18F-FDG-PET, comparing 21 patients with LGS (mean age\u00a0=\u00a015 years) and 18 pseudo-controls (mean age\u00a0=\u00a019 years), studied at Austin Health Melbourne, between 2004 and 2015. To minimise the influence of individual patient lesions in the LGS group, we only studied brain hemispheres without structural MRI abnormalities. The pseudo-control group consisted of age- and sex-matched patients with unilateral temporal lobe epilepsy, using only the hemispheres contralateral to the side of epilepsy. Voxel-wise permutation testing compared 18F-FDG-PET uptake between groups. Associations were explored between areas of altered metabolism and clinical variables (age of seizure onset, proportion of life with epilepsy, and verbal/nonverbal ability). Penetrance maps were calculated to explore spatial consistency of altered metabolic patterns across individual patients with LGS.\nRESULTS: Although not always readily apparent on visual inspection of individual patient scans, group analysis revealed hypometabolism in a network of regions including prefrontal and premotor cortex, anterior and posterior cingulate, inferior parietal lobule, and precuneus (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05, corrected for family-wise error). These brain regions tended to show a greater reduction in metabolism in non-verbal compared to verbal LGS patients, although this difference was not statistically significant. No areas of hypermetabolism were detected on group analysis, although \u223c25 % of individual patients showed increased metabolism (relative to pseudo-controls) in the brainstem, putamen, thalamus, cerebellum, and pericentral cortex.\nDISCUSSION: Interictal hypometabolism in frontoparietal cortex in LGS is compatible with our previous EEG-fMRI and SPECT studies showing that interictal bursts of generalised paroxysmal fast activity and tonic seizures recruit similar cortical regions.

Seizure types consist primarily of axial tonic, atonic, and atypical absence; nocturnal tonic seizures are the most common seizure pattern in this population, but often are not one of the initial seizure patterns. Some patients also have myoclonic seizures; this seizure pattern is less frequent than the three preceding types. Although there are some cases that are cryptogenic, most are symptomatic, arising during prenatal and perinatal periods from intrauterine infections, and vascular insults to the brain. Examples of causes of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome include migrational abnormalities of the brain, late effects of CNS infections, certain genetic disorders such as tuberous sclerosis, and inherited metabolic disorders. The difficulty early in the course of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is distinguishing this diagnosis from severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy (Dravet syndrome) or from myoclonic-astatic epilepsy (Doose syndrome), as the seizure patterns in these three syndromes may overlap at the onset. EEG is a helpful diagnostic tool in the diagnosis of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, usually demonstrating high voltage, bifrontal 1.5-2.5\u2009Hz spike and wave complexes interictally, and attenuation with paroxysmal fast activity (10-13\u2009Hz) during the ictal phase.

The evolution of clinical features, EEG findings, and paucity of knowledge about LGS among adult health care providers can make LGS significantly underdiagnosed in the adult population. Management of LGS remains problematic beyond childhood due to intractable seizures, the difficult transition from pediatric to adult neurologists, challenging behaviors, impaired cognition, poor quality of life, and disabled social life.

Its pathophysiology, however, is largely unknown. A de novo mutation (c.G358A, p.D120N) in the human GABA type-A receptor \u03b23 subunit gene (GABRB3) has been identified in a patient with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. To determine whether the mutation causes Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in vivo in mice and to elucidate its mechanistic effects, we generated the heterozygous Gabrb3+/D120N knock-in mouse and found that it had frequent spontaneous atypical absence seizures, as well as less frequent tonic, myoclonic, atonic and generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Each of these seizure types had a unique and characteristic ictal EEG. In addition, knock-in mice displayed abnormal behaviours seen in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome including impaired learning and memory, hyperactivity, impaired social interactions and increased anxiety. This Gabrb3 mutation did not alter GABA type-A receptor trafficking or expression in knock-in mice. However, cortical neurons in thalamocortical slices from knock-in mice had reduced miniature inhibitory post-synaptic current amplitude and prolonged spontaneous thalamocortical oscillations. Thus, the Gabrb3+/D120N knock-in mouse recapitulated human Lennox-Gastaut syndrome seizure types and behavioural abnormalities and was caused by impaired inhibitory GABAergic signalling in the thalamocortical loop. In addition, treatment with antiepileptic drugs and cannabinoids ameliorated atypical absence seizures in knock-in mice. This congenic knock-in mouse demonstrates that a single-point mutation in a single gene can cause development of multiple types of seizures and multiple behavioural abnormalities.

Electroencephalography (EEG) shows characteristic generalized epileptic activity that is similar in those with lesional, genetic, or unknown causes, suggesting a common underlying mechanism. The condition typically begins in young children, leaving many severely disabled with recurring seizures throughout their adult life. Scalp EEG of the tonic seizures of LGS is characterized by a diffuse high-voltage slow transient evolving into generalized low-voltage fast activity, likely reflecting sustained fast neuronal firing over a wide cortical area. The typical interictal discharges (runs of slow spike-and-wave and bursts of generalized paroxysmal fast activity) also have a \"generalized\" electrical field, suggesting widespread cortical involvement. Recent brain mapping studies have begun to reveal which cortical and subcortical regions are active during these \"generalized\" discharges. In this critical review, we examine findings from neuroimaging studies of LGS and place these in the context of the electrical and clinical features of the syndrome. We suggest that LGS can be conceptualized as \"secondary network epilepsy,\" where the epileptic activity is expressed through large-scale brain networks, particularly the attention and default-mode networks. Cortical lesions, when present, appear to chronically interact with these networks to produce network instability rather than triggering each individual epileptic discharge. LGS can be considered as \"secondary\" network epilepsy because the epileptic manifestations of the disorder reflect the networks being driven, rather than the specific initiating process. In this review, we begin with a summation of the clinical manifestations of LGS and what this has revealed about the underlying etiology of the condition.

There is increasing scientific opinion in favour of a less rigid approach to LGS diagnosis and this clinical audit attempts to shed light on how the LGS diagnostic criteria used may have changed over time, in a large tertiary paediatric neurology unit (Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH), London, UK).\nMETHODS: Electronic patient records were reviewed for patients with a diagnosis of LGS made at GOSH within two time periods, 2014-2017 and 2018-2021. Patient demographics, aetiology, clinical features, EEG features, investigation results and medications were reviewed. Findings were compared against the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) Diagnostic Manual criteria for LGS diagnosis (the classical triad plus PFA in sleep). Existing GOSH data regarding total number of new epilepsy referrals to GOSH and ICD10 codes (including all epilepsy and epilepsy syndromes) per year were also used to review LGS diagnoses as proportions of new epilepsy referrals and total number of epilepsy diagnoses.\nRESULTS: 5 LGS diagnoses were made in 2014-2017 compared to 40 diagnoses made in 2018-2021. There was a steep increase in the number of LGS diagnoses and LGS diagnoses as a proportion of total epilepsy diagnoses in the last 4 years, coinciding with the licensing of cannabidiol for management of LGS in the UK in 2018. There was a much less marked increase in LGS diagnoses as a proportion of epilepsy referrals from 2018 (and an as yet unexplained high proportion in 2014). The 2014-17 cohort fit a more classical LGS diagnostic criteria of the triad plus presence of PFA on sleep EEG (100% in 2014-17 vs 68% in 2018-21), with a more classical preceding history of infantile spasms (80% in 2014-17 vs 23% in 2018-21). Common seizure types were similar in both groups and a male preponderance was also noted in both groups. Cannabidiol use in LGS patients has also increased over time, all prescribed after 2018.\nCONCLUSIONS: Despite the limitations of the small numbers of patients in each group, the results of this clinical audit are in keeping with changing clinical trends in favour of a broader LGS diagnostic criteria. The combination of this less rigid diagnostic criteria, the steep increase in diagnosis seen from 2018 onwards (coinciding with UK cannabidiol licencing for LGS in 2018) and the fact that most of the LGS patients in both groups are currently prescribed cannabidiol, may reflect a strategic shift in attitude towards LGS diagnosis or an increase in referrals for LGS, possibly to help facilitate access to novel treatments.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27497831": "PURPOSE: Many apparent differences exist in aetiology, genetics, anatomy and treatment response between colon cancer (CC) and rectal cancer (RC). This study examines the differences in patient characteristics, prevalence of complications and their effect on short-term survival, long-term survival and the rate of recurrence between RC and CC.\nMETHODS: For all stage II-III CC and RC patients who underwent resection with curative intent (2006-2008) in five hospitals in the Netherlands, occurrence of complications, crude survival, relative survival and recurrence rates were compared.\nRESULTS: A total of 767 CC and 272 RC patients underwent resection. Significant differences were found for age, gender, emergency surgery, T-stage and grade. CC patients experienced fewer complications compared to RC (p\u00a0=\u00a00.019), but CC patients had worse short-term mortality rates (1.5 versus 6.7\u00a0% for 30-day mortality, p\u00a0=\u00a00.001 and 5.2 versus 9.5\u00a0% for 90-day mortality, p\u00a0=\u00a00.032). The adjusted HR (overall survival) for CC patients with complications was 1.57 (1.23-2.01; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) as compared to patients without complications; for RC, the HR was 1.79 (1.12-2.87; p\u00a0=\u00a00.015). Relative survival analyses showed high excess mortality in the first months after surgery and a sustained, prolonged negative effect on both CC and RC. Complications were associated with a higher recurrence rate for both CC and RC; adjusted analyses showed a trend towards a significant association.\nCONCLUSION: Large differences exist in patient characteristics and clinical outcomes between CC and RC. CC patients have a significantly higher short-term mortality compared to RC patients due to a more severe effect of complications.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30200215": "Colon cancer (CC) and rectal cancer (RC) are synonymously called colorectal cancer (CRC).

Anatomically, the risk of developing RC is four times higher than CC, while physical activity helps to prevent CC but not RC. Obvious differences exist in molecular carcinogenesis, pathology, surgical topography and procedures, and multimodal treatment. Therefore, we conclude that CC is not the same as RC.

Signet-ring cell carcinomas (SRC) and mucinous adenocarcinomas (MAC) are two relatively infrequent histological subtypes. However, little is known about the predictors of LNM and prognosis to support the feasibility of local excision in early-stage SRC and MAC.\nMETHODS: The Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results Database were used to identify all patients with pT1 adenocarcinomas, including conventional adenocarcinoma (AC), MAC, and SRC. The prevalence of LNM was assessed, and the long-term survival rate in the above three types of colorectal cancer was calculated.\nRESULTS: SRC accounted for 0.3% and MAC accounted for 4.4% of the entire cohort of colorectal adenocarcinomas. Compared to AC, MRC and SRC were more often located in the proximal colon, and exhibited a higher grade. The incidence of LNM in AC, MAC, and SRC was 10.6%, 17.2%, and 33.3% for colon cancers and 14.8%, 25.9%, and 46.2% for rectal cancers, respectively. In patients with lymph nodes resected no less than 12, incidence of LNM in AC, MRC, and SRC was 12%, 21%, and 44% for colon tumors and 17%, 30%, and 14% for rectal tumors, respectively. Although, colon patients MAC showed an entirely worse survival rate than AC, rectum patients MAC showed a similar prognosis to AC. We found that in patients with rectal tumors, SRC had a worse 3 and 5-year prognosis than AC. However, for colon cancers, the prognosis of SRC was similar to that of AC. Histology was not found to be an independent prognostic factor in multivariate survival analysis.\nCONCLUSIONS: MAC and SRC are two distinct subtypes of colorectal cancer that require special attention despite their relatively rare prevalence. pT1 patients with SRC of the rectum and patients with MAC of the colon have higher incidences of LNM, and with these adverse outcomes, local excision is not recommended.

Recent studies demonstrate that patients with advanced right-sided colon cancers have a worse prognosis than those with left-sided colon or rectal cancers, and these patient subgroups respond differently to biological therapies. Historically, management of patients with metastatic colon and rectal cancers has been similar, and colon and rectal cancer patients have been grouped together in large clinical trials. Clearly, the differences in molecular biology among right-sided colon, left-sided colon, and rectal cancers should be further studied in order to account for disparities in clinical outcomes. We profiled 10,570 colorectal tumors (of which 2,413 were identified as arising from the left colon, right colon, or rectum) using next-generation sequencing, immunohistochemistry, chromogenic in-situ hybridization, and fragment analysis (Caris Life Sciences, Phoenix, AZ). Right-sided colon cancers had higher rates of microsatellite instability, more frequent aberrant activation of the EGFR pathway including higher BRAF and PIK3CA mutation rates, and increased mutational burden compared to left-sided colon and rectal cancers. Rectal cancers had higher rates of TOPO1 expression and Her2/neu amplification compared to both left- and right-sided colon cancers. Molecular variations among right-sided colon, left-sided colon, and rectal tumors may contribute to differences in clinical behavior. The site of tumor origin (left colon, right colon, or rectum) should certainly be considered when selecting treatment regimens and stratifying patients for future clinical trials.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2305211": "DNA ploidy patterns were studied by flow cytometry in nuclear suspensions from 149 paraffin-embedded colorectal adenocarcinomas.

It is unclear whether colon cancer and rectal cancer are associated with different prognostic factors based on the anatomic difference.\nMETHODS: We assessed the prognostic factors and survival outcomes of patients with colorectal cancer who underwent pulmonary metastasectomy (PM), disaggregated by the location of primary colorectal cancer. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to identify variables that influenced the outcomes of pulmonary metastasectomy.\nRESULTS: Between 2008 and 2017, 179 patients underwent PM classified into colon cancer and rectal cancer groups based on the site of origin of metastasis. The median postoperative follow-up was 2.3 years (range, 0.1-10.6). The post-PM 5-year survival rate in the colon cancer and rectal cancer groups was 42.5% and 39.9%, respectively (p\u00a0=\u00a00.310).

Although rectal cancer is thought to be biologically similar to colon cancer, the anatomic complexity of the pelvis makes therapy for this disease considerably more complicated. Local recurrence is also a greater concern in rectal cancer than in colon cancer. The choice of surgical therapy depends on the location of the tumor, depth of rectal wall invasion, and clinical stage. Surgical options include local excision (transanal excision and transanal endoscopic microsurgery) and radical resection (low anterior resection, extended low anterior resection with coloanal anastomosis, abdominoperineal resection [APR], and pelvic exenteration). Technical advances such as transanal endoscopic microsurgery and laparoscopy also are changing the surgical approach to rectal tumors. Finally, chemotherapy and radiation are now frequently recommended in conjunction with surgical therapy. This article reviews the current surgical approach to treating patients with rectal cancer.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36538637": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether tumor deposits (TDs) in rectal cancer are associated with increased recurrence risk and decreased survival.\nBACKGROUND: Tumor deposits (TDs) are considered a risk factor for recurrence after colon cancer resection, and the presence of TDs prompts adjuvant chemotherapy. The prognostic relevance of TDs in rectal cancer requires further exploration.\nMETHODS: All patients treated with abdominal resection surgery for rectal cancer in Sweden between 2011 and 2014 were eligible for inclusion in this retrospective cohort study based on prospectively collected data from the Swedish Colorectal Cancer Registry. The primary endpoint was local recurrence or distant metastasis. Secondary outcomes were overall and relative survival.\nRESULTS: Five thousand four hundred fifty-five patients were identified of which 3769 patients were analyzed after exclusion. TDs were found in 404 (10.7%) patients, including 140 (3.7%) patients with N1c-status. In TD-positive patients, local recurrence and distant metastasis rates at 5 years were 6.3% [95% CI 3.8-8.8%] and 38.9% [95% CI, 33.6-43.5%] compared with 2.7% [95% CI, 2.1-3.3%] and 14.3% [95% CI, 13.1-15.5%] in TD-negative patients. In multivariable regression analysis, the risk of local recurrence and distant metastasis were increased; HR 1.86 [95% CI, 1.09-3.19; P =0.024] and 1.87 [95% CI, 1.52-2.31; P =<0.001], respectively. Overall survival at 5 years was 68.8% [95% CI, 64.4-73.4%] in TD-positive patients and 80.7% [95% CI, 79.4-82.1%] in TD-negative patients. pN1c-patients had similar outcomes regarding local recurrence, distant metastasis, and survival as pN1a-b stage patients. TD-positive pN1a-b patients had significantly worse outcomes whereas TDs did not affect outcomes in pN2a-b patients.\nCONCLUSION: This study suggests that TDs have a negative impact on the prognosis in rectal cancer.

Metastatic foci, including LNM and TD, in the LPLN area were defined as lateral pelvic metastases (LP-M) and were evaluated according to LP-M status: presence (absence vs. presence), histopathological classification (LNM vs. TD), and number (one to three vs. four or more). We evaluated the relapse-free survival of each model and compared them using the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Harrell's concordance index (c-index).\nRESULTS: Forty-nine of 226 patients (22%) had LP-M, and 15 patients (7%) had TDs. The median number of LP-M per patient was one (range, 1-9).

The association of NLR with clinicopathologic features and survival was evaluated and compared with the American Joint Committee on cancer (AJCC) TNM staging and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) models.\nRESULTS: High NLR was significantly associated with worse DFS (HR, 1.36; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.08-1.70; P\u00a0= .009) and OS (HR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.29-2.10; P\u00a0< .0005) in all stages for patients with colon, but not rectal, cancer. High NLR was significantly associated with site-specific worse prognosis, which was stronger in the left versus right colon; an inverse relationship with grade was found. The impact of high NLR on DFS and OS occurred early, with the majority of deaths within 2 years following surgery. Adjusted HRs for 5-year and 2-year outcomes in colon cancer per each additional 2-unit increase in NLR were 1.15 (95% CI, 1.08-1.23) and 1.20 (95% CI, 1.10-1.30), respectively.

TP gene expression in tumors correlated with lymph node staging, with higher expression relating to a higher number of positive nodes and a worse N-stage. Higher TP expression was also associated with a worse histological tumor grade. Patients with rectal cancer had significantly higher TP expression in mucosa and tumors compared with patients having colon cancer.\nCONCLUSION: Higher intratumoral TP expression appears to be related to a worse N stage, and thus, with a worse prognosis.

However, its usefulness has not been sufficiently analyzed. The results in patients with tumors in initial stages are very limited, and there are descriptive parameters of survival that have not been analyzed in detail. In this study, the relationship between primary tumor location and survival in CRC patients was analyzed. Materials And Methods: This was a retrospective observational study. All patients treated consecutively for CRC between January 2005 and December 2019 in the same hospital center were included. Overall survival (OS), cancer-related survival (CRS), time to recurrence (TTR), relapse-free survival (RFS) and postrecurrence survival (PRS) were analyzed, and the results were classified by tumor stage. The results were compared among patients with right colon (RS), left colon (LS) and rectal tumors. Results: In the entire cohort, patients with RS tumors had lower OS and lower CRS at 60 months after diagnosis than did patients with LS or rectal tumors. In the regression analysis, the localization of the primary tumor was an independent prognostic indicator for OS and CRS. Analysis by tumor stage showed that patients with RS stage III tumors had lower OS and lower CRS at 60 months than did patients with LS and rectal tumors (42%, 59% and 53%, respectively, p = 0.006; and 48%, 63% and 57%, respectively, p = 0.025). Additionally, patients with RS Stage IV tumors had lower OS and lower CRS at 36 months than did patients with LS and rectal tumors (9%, 24%, 24%, respectively, p &lt; 0.001; and 10%, 24% and 24%, respectively, p &lt; 0.001). No differences were found in TTR and RFS among patients with stage I and II RS, LS, and rectal tumors. In contrast, patients with stage RS III tumors had significantly poorer PRS (9% for RS tumors, 13% for LS tumors, and 22% for rectal tumors) (p &lt; 0.001). Conclusion: The location of the primary tumor in patients with CRC is related to survival. The effect of laterality is more marked in patients with stage III and IV tumors. Patients with RS tumors had lower OS and CRS due to the lower survival of patients with stage IV RS tumors and lower PRS for patients with stage III tumors.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32051712": "INTRODUCTION: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is rapidly increasing in developed countries. In Taiwan, the incidence rate of CRC has increased during the past decade, but the 5-year survival has remained at approximately 63%. In this study, we sought to determine the 5-year survival rate of patients diagnosed with colon and rectum cancer and to determine factors affecting survival.\nMATERIAL AND METHODS: All patients from the Taiwan Cancer Database of the medical center hospital in North Taiwan between 2007 and 2013 were identified. Survival analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier curves, and differences between the curves were analyzed using the log-rank test. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to analyze survival by each variable.\nRESULTS: A total of 869 patients were included: 554 (63.8%) patients had colon cancer and 315 (36.2%) had rectum cancer. The mean survival time was 71.27 \u00b11.27 months (colon group: 71.90 \u00b11.58 months; rectum group: 67.88 \u00b11.95 months). There was no significant difference (p = 0.493) between patients who had colon or rectum cancer. The forward stepwise Cox regression analysis results indicated that perineural invasion, distant metastasis, age, pathological differentiation grade, and obstruction were statistically significant for patients who had CRC, colon cancer or rectum cancer.\nCONCLUSIONS: The long-term survival from CRC, colon cancer and rectum cancer remains promising, as 68.66%, 69.11% and 67.90% of patients are alive 5 years after being diagnosed, respectively. Perineural invasion was found to be an important factor related to the survival of patients who have CRC.

Univariate and multivariate logistic or Cox regression and propensity score matching were used to explore the association between LNM/survival and tumor site.\nRESULTS: Information for 12,404 patients, including 9655 colonic AC and 2749 rectal AC patients, was extracted from the SEER database. The 516 AC patients included 184 colonic and 332 rectal AC patients from our center. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed a correlation between LNM and tumor site (colon vs rectum, odds ratio [OR] =1.52, 95% CI, 1.349-1.714, P<0.001). Additionally, we found that younger age, T1b stage, poor differentiation, and lymphatic invasion were risk factors for LNM. After adjusting for confounding factors by PSM, we found that the location of the rectum remained a higher risk factor for LNM. However, we found that patients diagnosed with rectal AC had a prognosis similar to that of patients diagnosed with colonic AC, which was demonstrated by the analysis of SEER data and data from our center.\nCONCLUSION: T1-stage rectal AC may have a higher risk of LNM than colonic AC, while rectal AC has a prognosis similar to that of colonic AC.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33611650": "BACKGROUND: Previous studies of stage III colon cancer using the hazard function demonstrated that the risk of recurrence in patients with adjuvant chemotherapy never exceeded that of patients without adjuvant chemotherapy.

This study aimed to compare the recurrence hazard of stage III rectal cancer with that of colon cancer by adjuvant chemotherapy status using the hazard function, a method that allows for the assessment of instantaneous risk of recurrence over time.\nMETHODS: This retrospective nationwide study consisted of 10,356 patients with stage III colorectal cancer who underwent curative resection between January 1997 and December 2012 in Japan. Recurrence hazards of rectal and colon cancers were compared between patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy and those who were not. Analyses in which recurrence was divided into local and distant recurrence were also performed.\nRESULTS: The hazard rate of recurrence in rectal cancer patients with adjuvant chemotherapy was consistently lower throughout the follow-up period, and the peak time of recurrence later, compared to patients without adjuvant chemotherapy (peaked at 15.7 vs. 7.1\u00a0months). Adjuvant chemotherapy also strongly suppressed distant recurrence but not local recurrence in rectal cancer patients. Similar results were observed in colon cancer patients.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our results using nationwide real-world data in Japan suggest that, similar to what is observed in colon cancer patients, adjuvant chemotherapy delays the peak of recurrence and suppresses distant recurrence in stage III rectal cancer patients.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33211264": "BACKGROUND: Rectal cancer accounts for one-third of all colorectal cancer (CRC) cases.

In a preliminary proteomic study, variation in the levels of heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) in colorectal cancer samples was observed. The expression of HSP27 in a cohort of 404 patients with colorectal cancer with a predominantly poor prognosis was characterised and an investigation was undertaken of whether the differences were related to clinical outcome. HSP27 levels in diagnostic rectal biopsies were compared with matched surgical samples to determine whether changes in expression occurred in the time between biopsy and surgery and to investigate whether preoperative radiotherapy affected expression. Finally, the relationship between HSP27 expression and outcome was examined in an independent cohort of 315 patients with a predominantly good prognosis.\nMETHODS: HSP27 levels were determined using combined two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and tandem mass spectrometry (12 cases) and by immunohistochemistry using tissue microarrays of colorectal cancers sampled at surgery and 80 diagnostic rectal biopsies.\nRESULTS: HSP27 overexpression was strongly associated with poor cancer-specific survival in rectal cancer (n=205, p=0.0063) but not colon cancer (n=199, p=0.7385) in the cohort with a poor prognosis. Multivariate Cox regression confirmed nodal metastases (p=0.0001) and HSP27 expression (p=0.0233) as independent markers of survival in rectal cancer. HSP27 levels remained unchanged in the majority of cases (65/80, 81%) between diagnostic biopsies and matched surgical samples, regardless of whether patients had undergone preoperative radiotherapy. In the cohort with a good prognosis the association between HSP27 and survival was not observed in patients with either rectal (n=115; p=0.308) or colon cancer (n=200; p=0.713).\nCONCLUSION: In a large cohort of patients with a poor prognosis, HSP27 is an independent marker of poor outcome in rectal cancer; its expression is not altered by neoadjuvant radiotherapy.

Primary tumor location (PTL) seems to act as a master prognostic factor pooling different clinical, pathological, and molecular poor prognostic factors. In fact, right-sided (RS) CRC patients are more frequently female\u00a0and elderly with microsatellite unstable, BRAF mutated, CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP)-high, poorly differentiated tumors, compared to left-sided (LS) CRC patients. PTL does not seem to clearly influence disease-free survival (DFS) in localised colon cancer even though the opposite prognostic value of RS tumors on DFS depending on RAS/BRAF mutational status has been recently suggested in these patients. In metastatic CRC (mCRC), the poor prognosis associated with RS tumors is confirmed in the most recent publications in the era of double and triple chemotherapeutic regimens and targeted agents. Concerning the predictive value of PTL, in patients with RAS wild-type mCRC in the first-line setting, anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) therapy combined with chemotherapy appears to be more effective than bevacizumab in LS CRC, while patients with RS CRC benefit less from anti-EGFR therapy, and intensive chemotherapy plus bevacizumab may be more appropriate but EGFR antibodies remain an option if objective response is needed.

BPD is characterized by extreme sensitivity to perceived interpersonal slights, an unstable sense of self, intense and volatile emotionality and impulsive behaviours that are often self-destructive. Most patients gradually enter symptomatic remission, and their rate of remission can be accelerated by evidence-based psychosocial treatments. Although self-harming behaviours and proneness to crisis can decrease over time, the natural course and otherwise effective treatments of BPD usually leave many patients with persistent and severe social disabilities related to depression or self-harming behaviours. Thus, clinicians need to actively enquire about the central issues of interpersonal relations and unstable identity.

Forkhead box A1 (FOXA1) is a member of the forkhead box transcription factor family and functions as a pioneer factor of the estrogen receptor (ER) in breast cancer. In the present study, we demonstrate that FOXA1 mRNA was upregulated by estrogen and that estrogen receptor-\u03b1 (ER\u03b1) recruitment to ER-binding sites in the vicinity of the FOXA1 gene was increased by estrogen in ER\u03b1-positive MCF-7 breast cancer cells. The estrogen-induced FOXA1 upregulation was repressed by 4-hydroxytamoxifen treatment. We also demonstrated that the proliferation and the migration of MCF-7 cells were decreased by FOXA1-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA; siFOXA1). Furthermore, siFOXA1 decreased the estrogen response element-driven transcription and the estrogen-dependent upregulation of ER\u03b1 target genes in MCF-7 cells. Next, the immunohistochemical analyses of FOXA1 were performed using two groups of breast cancer specimens. The nuclear immunoreactivity of FOXA1 was detected in 80 (74%) of 108 human invasive breast cancers and was negatively correlated with tumor grade and positively correlated with hormone receptor status, including ER\u03b1 and progesterone receptor, pathological tumor size, and immunoreactivity of FOXP1, another FOX family transcription factor. FOXA1 immunoreactivity was significantly elevated in the relapse-free breast cancer patients treated with tamoxifen. Notably, the double-positive immunoreactivities of FOXA1 and FOXP1 were significantly associated with a favorable prognosis for the relapse-free and overall survival of patients with tamoxifen-treated breast cancer, with lower P values compared with FOXA1 or FOXP1 immunoreactivity alone. These results suggest that FOXA1 plays an important role in the proliferation and migration of breast cancer cells by modulating estrogen signaling and that the double-positive immunoreactivities of FOXA1 and FOXP1 are associated with a favorable prognosis of tamoxifen-treated breast cancer.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17163418": "The transcription factor Forkhead-box A1 (Foxa1), a member of the FOX class of transcription factors, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of lung, esophageal and prostate cancers.

FOXA1 is expressed in breast cancer cells. It segregates with genes that characterize the luminal subtypes in DNA microarray analyses. The utility of FOXA1 as a possible independent prognostic factor has not been determined in breast cancers.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: A tissue microarray comprising tumors from 438 patients with 15.4 years median follow-up was analyzed for FOXA1 expression by immunohistochemistry. Interpretable FOXA1 expression obtained in 404 patients was analyzed along with other prognostic factors like tumor grade, size, nodal status, ER, progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2/neu.\nRESULTS: FOXA1 expression (score >3) was seen in 300 of 404 breast cancers and it correlated with ER (P = 0.000001), PR (P = 0.00001), and luminal A subtype (P = 0.000001). Loss of expression was noted with worsening tumor grade (P = 0.001). Univariate analysis showed nodal status (P = 0.0000012), tumor size (P = 0.00001), FOXA1 (P = 0.0004), and ER (P = 0.012) to be predictors of breast cancer-specific survival.

FOXA1 is also consistently expressed in luminal breast cancer cell lines even in the absence of ER. In contrast, breast cancer cell lines representing the basal subtype do not express FOXA1. To delineate an ER-independent role for FOXA1 in maintaining the luminal phenotype, and hence a more favorable prognosis, we performed expression microarray analyses on FOXA1-positive and ER-positive (MCF7, T47D), or FOXA1-positive and ER-negative (MDA-MB-453, SKBR3) luminal cell lines in the presence or absence of transient FOXA1 silencing. This resulted in three FOXA1 transcriptomes: (1) a luminal signature (consistent across cell lines), (2) an ER-positive signature (restricted to MCF7 and T47D) and (3) an ER-negative signature (restricted to MDA-MB-453 and SKBR3). Gene set enrichment analyses revealed FOXA1 silencing causes a partial transcriptome shift from luminal to basal gene expression signatures. FOXA1 binds to a subset of both luminal and basal genes within luminal breast cancer cells, and loss of FOXA1 increases enhancer RNA transcription for a representative basal gene (CD58). These data suggest FOXA1 directly represses a subset of basal signature genes. Functionally, FOXA1 silencing increases migration and invasion of luminal cancer cells, both of which are characteristics of basal subtype cells. We conclude FOXA1 controls plasticity between basal and luminal breast cancer cells, not only by inducing luminal genes but also by repressing the basal phenotype, and thus aggressiveness. Although it has been proposed that FOXA1-targeting agents may be useful for treating luminal tumors, these data suggest that this approach may promote transitions toward more aggressive cancers.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21503684": "Forkhead box protein A1 (FOXA1) is a \"pioneer factor\" that plays a role in controlling nearly 50% of estrogen receptor target genes.

Here in this study, we aimed to identify which are the proteins that could potentially control FOXA1 function in breast cancer cell lines expressing different molecular markers. We first established a luciferase reporter system reflecting FOXA1 binding to DNA.

Regardless of estrogen receptor status, HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) enriched cell lines showed similar response to kinase inhibitors, indicating the control of FOXA1 by cell signaling kinases. Among these kinases, we identified additional receptor tyrosine kinases and cyclin-dependent kinases as regulators of FOXA1. Furthermore, we performed proteomics experiments from FOXA1 inmunoprecipitated protein complex to identify that FOXA1 interacts with several proteins. Among all the targets, we identified cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) as a positive factor to interact with FOXA1 in BT474 cell line. In silico analyses confirmed that cyclin-dependent kinases might be the kinases responsible for FOXA1 phosphorylation at the Forkhead domain and the transactivation domain.

Up-regulated FOXA1 employs superenhancers (SEs) to synchronize transcriptional reprogramming in endocrine-resistant breast cancer cells, reflecting an early embryonic development process.

FOXA1 expression and pathologic response were evaluated. We then statistically analyzed FOXA1 expression and its relationship with chemosensitivity.\nRESULTS: FOXA1 expression before NAC was correlated with poor chemoresponse in ER-positive as well as luminal A and luminal B breast cancer patients (p = 0.002, 0.001, and 0.049 respectively). Significant association between change of FOXA1 staining position after NAC and chemosensitivity also was observed (p = 0.024).

Here, we further integrated FOXA1 genomic binding profile with the isogenic ER cistrome, accessible genome, and transcriptome data of T47D cell model. FOXA1 redistribution was significantly associated with transcriptomic alterations caused by ESR1 mutations. Furthermore, in ESR1-mutant cells, FOXA1-binding sites less frequently overlapped with ER, and differential gene expression was less associated with the canonical FOXA1-ER axis. Motif analysis revealed a unique enrichment of retinoid X receptor (RXR) motifs in FOXA1-binding sites of ESR1-mutant cells. Consistently, ESR1-mutant cells were more sensitive to growth stimulation with the RXR agonist LG268. The mutant-specific response was dependent on two RXR isoforms, RXR-\u03b1 and RXR-\u03b2, with a stronger dependency on the latter.

We now show that the vast majority (>99%) of FOXA1 binding events are unaffected by steroid activation. A small number (<1%) of FOXA1 binding sites appear to be induced by estrogen, but these are created from chromatin interactions between ER binding sites and adjacent FOXA1 binding sites and do not represent genuine new FOXA1-pioneering elements.

Multivariate analysis showed that only nodal status (p = 0.0006) and ER (p = 0.0017) were significant predictors of OS. In luminal subtype patient subgroup, FOXA1 expression was associated with better survival (p = 0.0284) on univariate analysis.\nCONCLUSION: Based on this study in patients treated with surgery followed by adjuvant anthracycline-based chemotherapy, FOXA1 expression is associated with good prognosis. It correlates with luminal subtype breast cancer, and could possibly serve as a clinical marker for luminal subtype A. Prognostic ability of FOXA1 in these low-risk breast cancers may prove to be useful in treatment decision making.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19261198": "Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease and classification is important for clinical management. At least five subtypes can be identified based on unique gene expression patterns; this subtype classification is distinct from the histopathological classification. The transcription factor network(s) required for the specific gene expression signature in each of these subtypes is currently being elucidated. The transcription factor network composed of the oestrogen (estrogen) receptor alpha (ERalpha), FOXA1 and GATA3 may control the gene expression pattern in luminal subtype A breast cancers. Breast cancers that are dependent on this network correspond to well-differentiated and hormone-therapy-responsive tumours with good prognosis. In this review, we discuss the interplay between these transcription factors with a particular emphasis on FOXA1 structure and function, and its ability to control ERalpha function. Additionally, we discuss modulators of FOXA1 function, ERalpha-FOXA1-GATA3 downstream targets, and potential therapeutic agents that may increase differentiation through FOXA1.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17373880": "Gene expression profiling studies have classified breast cancer into five intrinsic subtypes with distinct prognostic significance: luminal type A, luminal type B, normal-like, HER-2-positive and basal type. These studies have also uncovered novel diagnostic markers and molecular targets. FOXA1, a winged-helix transcription factor belonging to the forkhead family, is one among them as it is expressed predominantly in luminal type A breast cancer, which is characterized by the presence of estrogen receptor-alpha (ERalpha) with favorable prognosis. FOXA1 is a 'pioneer' factor that binds to chromatinized DNA, opens the chromatin and enhances binding of ERalpha to its target genes. It is essential for the expression of approximately 50% of ERalpha:estrogen-regulated genes. Thus, a network comprising FOXA1, ERalpha and estrogen constitutes a major proliferation and survival signal for luminal type A breast cancer. However, by controlling differentiation and by regulating the expression of cell cycle inhibitor p27kip1 and the cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin, FOXA1 may prevent metastatic progression of luminal type A breast cancer. This article reviews possible roles of FOXA family transcription factors in breast cancer initiation, hormone dependency and speculates on the potential of FOXA1 as a therapeutic target.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36204307": "Breast cancer is the leading cause of death in female cancers, and what's worse, tamoxifen resistance occurs in almost 30% breast cancer patients and has seriously attenuated the therapeutic effect. It is widely studied that epigenetic regulation has played important role in the development of tamoxifen resistance. FOXA1 is a pioneer transcription factor that can translate epigenetic signature into transcription regulation and also drive genome-wide enhancer reprogramming in breast cancer. However, the chromatin super enhancer landscape orchestrated by FOXA1 and the key downstream targets of the FOXA1 oncogenic network in tamoxifen resistance remain elusive. Through analyzing the FOXA1 ChIP-seq data in tamoxifen sensitive MCF7 and tamoxifen resistant MCF7/TamR cells, we show that the FOXA1 chromatin occupancy is enhanced in both the promoter and enhancer regions, and the recruitment events may be E2 dependent in both MCF7 and MCF7/TamR cells. By integratively analyzing the FOXA1 ChIP-seq data and RNA-seq data of MCF7 and MCF7/TamR cells, we find that the enhanced or reduced FOXA1 chromatin binding densities may synchronize the transcriptional activity in tamoxifen resistance. Besides, we identify 1003 super enhancer associated protein coding genes and five super enhancer associated lncRNAs (ATP1A1-AS1, CASC11, CASC15, KCTD21-AS1, LINC00885) in tamoxifen resistance. By KM survival analysis, we find that high expression level of ATP1A1-AS1 and its sense transcript ATP1A1 indicates favorable clinical outcome among the luminal endocrine treated breast cancer patients. Further coexpression analysis indicates that ATP1A1-AS1 is significantly correlated with ATP1A1, and RT-qPCR results show that they both are downregulated in MCF7/TamR cells. Our study shows that the FOXA1 transcriptional regulatory network may promote the development of tamoxifen resistance, and identifies one super enhancer associated lncRNA ATP1A1-AS1 that may work as promising biomarker or drug target in tamoxifen resistance.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35829908": "BACKGROUND: Huntington's disease is a rare neurodegenerative illness of the central nervous system that is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. Mutant huntingtin protein\u00a0is produced as a result of enlargement of CAG repeat in the N-terminal of the polyglutamine tract.\nAIM OF THE STUDY: Herein, we aim to investigate the mutations and their effects on the HTT gene and its genetic variants. Additionally, the protein-protein interaction of HTT with other proteins and receptor-ligand interaction with the three-dimensional structure of huntingtin protein\u00a0were identified.\nMETHODS: A comprehensive analysis of the HTT interactome and protein-ligand interaction has been carried out to provide a global picture of structure-function analysis of huntingtin protein. Mutations were analyzed and mutation verification tools were used to check the effect of mutation on protein function.\nRESULTS: The results showed, mutations in a single gene are not only responsible for causing a particular disease but may also cause other hereditary disorders as well. Moreover, the modification at the nucleotide level also cause the change in the specific amino acid which may disrupt the function of HTT and its interacting proteins contributing in disease pathogenesis. Furthermore, the interaction between MECP2 and BDNF lowers the rate of transcriptional activity. Molecular docking further confirmed the strong interaction between MECP2 and BDNF with highest affinity. Amino acid residues of the HTT protein, involved in the interaction with tetrabenazine were N912, Y890, G2385, and V2320. These findings proved, tetrabenazine as one of the potential therapeutic agent for treatment of Huntington's disease.\nCONCLUSION: These results give further insights into the genetics of Huntington's disease for a better understanding of disease models which will be beneficial for the future therapeutic studies.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37465925": "Despite a growing number of available therapeutic options for ulcerative colitis (UC), up to 50% of patients do not respond to initial treatment or lose response over time, highlighting the need for novel therapies.

Miri effectively inhibits the interaction of IL-23 with its receptor, and potently blocks IL-23-induced IL-17 production in cell-based assays while preserving the function of IL-12. In both local and systemic in vivo mouse models, miri blocked IL-23-induced keratin mRNA or IL-17 production, respectively.

A PubMed database literature review was conducted for relevant articles published from 2017 to 2022. Ongoing clinical phase II trials were retrieved from ClinicalTrials.gov database or abstracts from major congresses. Future perspectives for the treatment of CD patients with these new molecules were also discussed.\nEXPERT OPINION: Among the most promising biologics are interleukin (IL)-23p19 inhibitors (guselkumab, mirikizumab, and brazikumab), IL-6 inhibitors, and anti-adhesion molecules (ontamalimab). Furthermore, multiple biologics with different mechanisms of action are in clinical development for moderate-to-severe CD including molecules with anti-fibrotic mechanism of action (anti-TL1A, anti-IL-36 receptor). In addition to efficacy, some of them provide reassuring safety profiles.

IL-23 is an inflammatory cytokine involved in both innate and adaptive immunity, which has been identified as a therapeutic target in Crohn's disease [CD] and ulcerative colitis [UC] through its upstream inhibition of the T helper 17 [Th17] pathway. We sought to review available data on the efficacy of IL-23 inhibitors in the treatment of IBD and the potential for clinical and molecular predictors of response to facilitate a personalised medicine approach with these agents.\nMETHODS: We reviewed and summarised available clinical trial data on the use of the IL-23 inhibitors risankizumab, brazikumab, mirikizumab, and guselkumab in the treatment of IBD, as well as the evidence from studies of these agents in IBD and other immune-mediated conditions which might inform prediction of response to IL-23 inhibition.\nRESULTS: Early clinical trials have demonstrated promising results following both induction and maintenance therapy with IL-23 inhibitors in CD and UC. Pre- and post-treatment levels of IL-22 and post-treatment levels of IL-17 have been identified as potential molecular predictors of response to therapy, in several studies. No significant clinical predictors of response have been identified thus far.\nCONCLUSIONS: IL-23 antagonism is a promising therapeutic approach in IBD.

Mirikizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against the p19 subunit of IL-23, significantly reduced bowel urgency in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with moderate-to-severe UC (NCT02589665).\nMETHODS: All patients (N = 249) reported symptoms including absence or presence of bowel urgency. Absence of urgency was defined as no urgency for the 3 consecutive days prior to each scheduled visit. Missing urgency data were imputed as present. After 12 weeks of induction treatment, patients who achieved clinical response continued maintenance mirikizumab treatment through Week 52. We assessed the relationship of urgency with QoL, clinical outcomes, and inflammatory biomarkers at Weeks 12 and 52.\nRESULTS: Patients with absence of urgency demonstrated significantly greater improvement in Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) scores even after adjusting for rectal bleeding (RB) and stool frequency (SF), significantly higher rates of all clinical outcomes at Weeks 12 and 52, and a greater decrease in inflammatory biomarkers C-reactive protein and fecal calprotectin compared to those with presence of urgency. Absence of urgency at Week 12 was associated with improved IBDQ scores at Week 52, while Week 12 RB or SF status was not.\nCONCLUSIONS: Absence of urgency is strongly associated with improvement in QoL as well as clinical measures of UC disease activity. These findings suggest urgency may be a useful surrogate marker of disease activity and an important treatment target for UC.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37001911": "OBJECTIVE: Mirikizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting the interleukin-23 p19 subunit, was effective in a Phase 2 study (NCT02589665) of moderately-to-severely active ulcerative colitis (UC). We studied mirikizumab's impact on health-related quality of life (HRQoL).\nDESIGN: HRQoL was evaluated using the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) and 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) Physical Component Score (PCS) and Mental Component Score (MCS). Mixed effects models for repeated measures compared score changes between mirikizumab and placebo groups. Additional analyses evaluated associations between HRQoL score changes and achievement of efficacy endpoints at weeks 12 and 52.\nRESULTS: At week 12, IBDQ improved compared with placebo for all mirikizumab groups except mirikizumab 50\u2009mg (50\u2009mg, p=0.073; 200\u2009mg, p<0.001; 600\u2009mg, p<0.001).

Previous results have shown that 12 weeks of mirikizumab treatment downregulated transcripts associated with UC disease activity and tumor necrosis factor inhibitor resistance. We assessed week-52 gene expression from week-12 responders receiving mirikizumab or placebo.\nMETHODS: In the phase 2 AMAC study (NCT02589665), mirikizumab-treated patients achieving week-12 clinical response were rerandomized to mirikizumab 200 mg subcutaneous every 4 or 12 weeks through week 52 (N = 31). Week-12 placebo responders continued placebo through week 52 (N = 7). The limma R package clustered transcript changes in colonic mucosa biopsies from baseline to week 12 into differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Among DEGs, similarly expressed genes (DEGSEGs) maintaining week-12 expression through week 52 were identified.\nRESULTS: Of 89 DEGSEGs, 63 (70.8%) were present only in mirikizumab induction responders, 5 (5.6%) in placebo responders, and 21 (23.6%) in both. Week-12 magnitudes and week-52 consistency of transcript changes were greater in mirikizumab than in placebo responders (log2FC > 1). DEGSEG clusters (from 84 DEGSEGs identified in mirikizumab and mirikizumab/placebo responders) correlated to modified Mayo score (26/84 with Pearson correlation coefficient [PCC] >0.5) and Robarts Histopathology Index (55/84 with PCC >0.5), sustained through week 52.\nDISCUSSION: Mirikizumab responders had broader, more sustained transcriptional changes of greater magnitudes at week 52 vs placebo.

Besides tumor necrosis factor, interleukin (IL)-23 is a promising drug target, and antibodies for the combined inhibition of IL-23 and IL-12 (ustekinumab and briakinumab) or selective IL-23 inhibition (brazikumab, risankizumab, and mirikizumab) seem to be effective in Crohn's disease (CD) with emerging evidence also for ulcerative colitis (UC). Janus kinase (JAK) mediates intracellular signaling of a large number of cytokines. Tofacitinib is the first JAK inhibitor approved for UC, and the JAK inhibitors filgotinib and upadacitinib showed potential in CD. Leukocyte trafficking can be inhibited by interference with lymphocyte integrin-\u03b14\u03b27 or endothelial MadCAM-1. The \u03b14\u03b27 integrin inhibitor vedolizumab is an established treatment in IBD, and long-term data of pivotal studies are now available. Additional molecules with therapeutic potential are \u03b14\u03b27-specific abrilumab, \u03b27-specific etrolizumab, and the \u03b14-specific small molecule AJM300. PF-00547659, an antibody against endothelial MadCAM-1, also showed therapeutic potential in UC. Modulation of sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor (S1PR) activity is necessary for the egress of lymphocytes into the circulation, and S1PR modulation results in lymphocyte trapping in lymphatic organs. Ozanimod, an S1PR1 and S1PR5 inhibitor, has been successfully tested in initial studies in UC. Mesenchymal stem cell therapy has been approved for the treatment of complex, active CD fistula, and mesenchymal stem cell therapy might be a paradigm shift for this condition. Autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) has been successfully used in CD case series; however, in a randomized trial, a highly stringent endpoint was not met. However, considering positive effects in secondary endpoints, ASCT might be a future treatment of last resort in severe, refractory CD cases, provided that safer protocols can be provided.

EDS causes a myriad of symptoms, including skin hyperextensibility and fragility, easy bruising and bleeding, joint hypermobility, subluxation, dislocation, and chronic pain. Pain is one of the most common symptoms of EDS, leading to disability and decreased quality of life. Current guidelines for treating chronic pain in EDS are lacking. Clinicians focus on a conservative multidisciplinary approach in patients with EDS, which avoids surgical interventions and its accompanying risks of morbidity and mortality. The multidisciplinary approach includes physiotherapy, occupational therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, and pharmacologic interventions to decrease pain. This review identifies literature examining the components of this conservative multidisciplinary approach and their effectiveness across the PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Trip databases, using the terms \"Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome AND Pain Management\" that was then subsequently evaluated. The evaluation of this current literature provides weak evidence to support the efficacy of the individual components of the conservative multidisciplinary approach.

In this article, we illustrate 2 case reports of EDS patients with chronic pain and review the relevant literature regarding the pathological considerations and management of chronic pain in EDS.\nPATIENT CONCERNS: Our first patient had worsening multiple joint pains despite treatment with medications and a recent diagnosis of EDS-type 3. The second patient had a complicated history including longstanding EDS and multiple previous surgeries. She was referred due to concern about complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) in her upper extremity.\nDIAGNOSES: For the first patient, apart from chronic pain due to her EDS, her history also revealed that she suffered from kinesiophobia. For the second patient, a detailed clinical assessment revealed no signs of CRPS but instead a generalized worsening of EDS symptoms.\nINTERVENTIONS: Both patients were evaluated by the multidisciplinary team consisting of a pain physician, nurse, pain psychologist, and a kinesiologist. Their treatment involved optimization of daily medications, participation in pain self-management sessions that included cognitive behavioral therapy, graded exercises, coping, and relaxation strategies.\nOUTCOMES: Both patients demonstrated significantly better pain control and achieved overall improvement in daily living.\nLESSONS: EDS is a complex illness with a multitude of symptoms. As in our patients, EDS patients also suffer from panic and anxiety disorders that increase the burden of pain. Apart from optimization of medications, EDS patients are best managed by a multidisciplinary approach that includes pain education and life style changes.

Using capped nascent RNA sequencing (PRO-cap) dataset in human lymphoblastoid cell lines across individuals, we identified inter-individual variation of expression in over 80 thousand transcribed transcriptional regulatory elements (tTREs), in both enhancers and promoters. Co-expression analysis of eRNAs from tTREs across individuals revealed how enhancers interact with each other and with promoters. Mid-to-long range interactions showed distance-dependent decay, which was modified by TF occupancy. In particular, we found a class of 'bivalent' TFs, including Cohesin, which both facilitates and insulates the interaction between enhancers and/or promoters depending on the topology. In short ranges, we observed strand specific interactions between nearby eRNAs in both convergent or divergent orientations. Our finding supports a cooperative convergent eRNA model, which is compatible with eRNA remodeling neighboring enhancers rather than interfering with each other.

Over the last decade, the transcription of enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) - nascent RNAs transcribed from active enhancers - has emerged as a key factor regulating enhancer activity. eRNAs are relatively short-lived RNA species that are transcribed at very high rates but also quickly degraded. Nevertheless, eRNAs are deeply intertwined within enhancer regulatory networks and are implicated in a number of transcriptional control mechanisms. Enhancers show changes in function and sequence over evolutionary time, raising questions about the relationship between enhancer sequences and eRNA function. Moreover, the vast majority of single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with human complex diseases map to the non-coding genome, with causal disease variants enriched within enhancers. In this Primer, we survey the diverse roles played by eRNAs in enhancer-dependent gene expression, evaluating different models for eRNA function.

Results: In this study, we identified that antisense eRNA was regulated by androgen receptor (AR) activity in prostate cancer cells. Antisense eRNA negatively regulated antisense ncRNA in AR-related target genes' loci, through recruiting DNMT1 on the antisense enhancer in the gene-ending regions and elevating DNA methylation. Importantly, the chromatin exhibited a double looping manner that facilitated sense-eRNA to promoter and antisense-eRNA to gene-ending region in cis. Depletion of antisense eRNA impaired its neighbor mRNA expression, cancer growth and invasion. The expressions of antisense eRNA were correlated with biochemical recurrence and clinical marker PSA's levels in patients' tissues. Conclusions: The findings indicated that antisense eRNA was a functional RNA and may be a novel target that when suppressed improved prostate cancer therapy and diagnosis.

They play an important role in transcriptional regulation, mainly during cellular differentiation. eRNAs are tightly tissue- and cell-type specific and are induced by specific stimuli, activating promoters of target genes in turn. eRNAs usually have a very short half-life but in some cases, once activated, they can be stably expressed and acquire additional functions. Due to their critical role, eRNAs are often dysregulated in cancer and growing number of interactions with chromatin modifiers, transcription factors, and splicing machinery have been described. Enhancer activation and eRNA transcription have particular relevance also in inflammatory response, placing the eRNAs at the interplay between cancer and immune cells.

Enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) are subclass of lncRNAs that are synthesized from enhancer regions and have also been shown to coordinate gene expression. The biological function and significance of most lncRNAs and eRNAs remain to be determined. Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a ubiquitous cellular process that occurs during cellular migration, homeostasis, fibrosis, and cancer-cell metastasis. EMT-transcription factors, such as SNAI1 induce a complex transcriptional program that coordinates the morphological and molecular changes associated with EMT. Such complex transcriptional programs are often subject to coordination by networks of ncRNAs and thus can be leveraged to identify novel functional ncRNA loci. Here, using a genome-wide CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) screen targeting \u223c10,000 lncRNA loci we identified ncRNA loci that could either promote or attenuate EMT. We discovered a novel locus that we named SCREEM (SNAI1 cis-regulatory eRNAs expressed in monocytes). The SCREEM locus contained a cluster of eRNAs that when activated using CRISPRa induced expression of the neighboring gene SNAI1, driving concomitant EMT. However, the SCREEM eRNA transcripts themselves appeared dispensable for the induction of SNAI1 expression. Interestingly, the SCREEM eRNAs and SNAI1 were co-expressed in activated monocytes, where the SCREEM locus demarcated a monocyte-specific super-enhancer.

During chromatin looping, transcribed eRNAs interact with NamiRNAs through enhancer-promoter interaction to perform similar functions.

Here we review direct experimental evidence supporting a functional role of eRNAs in transcription and provide a general pipeline that could help in the design of experimental approaches to investigate the function of eRNAs. We propose that induction of transcriptional activity at enhancers promotes an increase in its activity by an RNA-mediated titration of regulatory proteins that can impact different processes like chromatin accessibility or chromatin looping. In a few cases, transcripts originating from enhancers have acquired specific molecular functions to regulate gene expression. We speculate that these transcripts are either nonannotated long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) or are evolving toward functional lncRNAs.

We find eRNAs not to exert their function through common structural or sequence motifs. Instead, eRNAs that exhibit a length >200 nucleotides and that contain unpaired guanosines make multiple, allosteric contacts with NELF subunits -A and -E to trigger efficient NELF release.

Enhancer RNAs (eRNAs), a type of long noncoding RNAs, are transcribed from enhancer regions in the genome. The tissue-specific expression of eRNAs is crucial in the regulation of gene expression and cancer development. The methods that identify eRNAs based solely on genomic sequence data have high error rates because they do not account for tissue specificity. Specific histone modifications associated with eRNAs offer valuable information for their identification. However, identification of eRNAs using histone modification data requires the use of both RNA-seq and histone modification data. Unfortunately, many public datasets contain only one of these components, which impedes the accurate identification of eRNAs.\nRESULTS: We introduce DeepITEH, a deep learning framework that leverages RNA-seq data and histone modification data from multiple samples of the same tissue to enhance the accuracy of identifying eRNAs. Specifically, deepITEH initially categorizes eRNAs into two classes, namely, regularly expressed eRNAs and accidental eRNAs, using histone modification data from multiple samples of the same tissue. Thereafter, it integrates both sequence and histone modification features to identify eRNAs in specific tissues. To evaluate the performance of DeepITEH, we compared it with four existing state-of-the-art enhancer prediction methods, SeqPose, iEnhancer-RD, LSTMAtt, and FRL, on four normal tissues and four cancer tissues. Remarkably, seven of these tissues demonstrated a substantially improved specific eRNA prediction performance with DeepITEH, when compared with other methods.

Knockdown of the more distal eRNA led to a drop in Cga mRNA levels, initially without effect on the forward eRNA levels. With time, however, the repression on the Cga increased, and the forward eRNA levels were suppressed also. We demonstrate that the interaction of the enhancer with the promoter is lost after eRNA knockdown. Dramatic changes also were seen in the chromatin, with an increase in total histone H3 occupancy throughout this region and a virtual loss of histone H3 Lys 4 trimethylation at the promoter following the eRNA knockdown.

The aim of this study is to summarize the current knowledge about eRNAs in several typical sex hormone-dependent cancers, mainly involving their roles in sex hormones mediated pathways and cancer progression.\nMETHODS: We reviewed all the published articles concerning eRNAs in sex hormone-dependent cancers, and summarized the roles of eRNAs in these cancers.\nRESULTS: In cancer development, elevated expression of some eRNAs could promote the progression of cancer cells. In gene regulation, eRNAs not only regulate gene activation but also participate in gene repression. Additionally, in androgen receptor signaling, eRNAs were found to play a role at cis and trans loci, and both sense and antisense strands of eRNAs are both important.\nCONCLUSION: Abnormal overexpression of eRNAs is mostly oncogenic, leading to cancer progression, and both strands of eRNAs play multiple and complex roles at cis and trans loci in sex hormones mediated pathways, which are tightly associated with sex hormone-dependent tumorigenesis.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32579929": "The function of enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) in transcriptional regulation remains obscure. By analyzing the genome-wide nascent transcript profiles in breast cancer cells, we identify a special group of eRNAs that are essential for estrogen-induced transcriptional repression. Using eRNAs of TM4SF1 and EFEMP1 as the paradigms, we find that these RNA molecules not only stabilize promoter-enhancer interactions but also recruit liganded estrogen receptor \u03b1 (ER\u03b1) to particular enhancer regions, facilitate the formation of a functional transcriptional complex, and cause gene silencing. Interestingly, ER\u03b1 is shown to directly bind with eRNAs by its DNA-binding domain. These eRNAs help with the formation of a specific ER\u03b1-centered transcriptional complex and promote the association of the histone demethylase KDM2A, which dismisses RNA polymerase II from designated enhancers and suppresses the transcription of target genes.

Plaques from PC Tg/ApoE-null mice exhibited increased levels of collagen and smooth muscle cells, and reduced levels of macrophages and lipid, compared with those from ApoE-null mice, indicating lesions of PC Tg/ApoE-null mice had characteristics of more stable plaques than those of ApoE-null mice. PC transgene enhanced high-density lipoprotein ability to protect low-density lipoprotein against oxidation in vitro. Serum intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 were also repressed by PC transgene. Proatherogenic reactions of Tg mouse peritoneal macrophages induced by oxidized low-density lipoprotein were inhibited by PC transgene, as indicated by reduced reactive oxygen species generation, inflammation, matrix metalloproteinase-9 expression, and foam cell formation. Our results demonstrate that the PC transgene not only represses atherogenesis but also promotes atherosclerotic plaque stability in vivo.

The most studied enzyme is PON1, which is associated with high density lipoprotein (HDL), having paraoxonase, arylesterase and lactonase activities. Due to these characteristics, the enzyme PON1 has been associated with the development of neurodegenerative diseases.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between lipoprotein oxidative stress and the activity of HDL-PON in healthy and obese subjects. Therefore, the activity of HDL-PON and the levels of lipid hydroperoxides in HDL and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) isolated from plasma of obese females (n = 12) and age-sex-matched controls (n = 31) were compared. Our results demonstrated for the first time that the activity of HDL-PON in obese subjects was significantly lower compared with that in controls (P < 0.001). Moreover, our results showed a significant increase in the levels of lipid hydroperoxides in HDL and LDL isolated from obese subjects (P < 0.001). The negative correlations established between HDL-PON activity and the levels of lipid hydroperoxides associated with HDL and LDL confirm the relationship between paraoxonase activity and lipid peroxidation of lipoproteins. Plasma levels of leptin correlated negatively with HDL-PON activity and positively with levels of lipid hydroperoxides in HDL and LDL of obese subjects, suggesting a relationship between leptin and oxidative damage of lipoproteins. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that the increase in oxidative stress in LDL and HDL of obese subjects is associated with a decrease in HDL-PON activity.

The activities and properties of PON proteins can be modulated by a number of environmental factors, including cigarette smoke. In the present article, a review of existing literature is employed to analyze both the direct and the indirect impact of cigarette smoking on the activity of members of the PON family. Cigarette smoking leads to direct inhibition of the hydrolytic activity of PON enzymes by modification of thiol groups, by the reactions of free radicals, or by inhibiting enzyme-active regions with heavy metals. It has been shown that cigarette smoking correlates with a decrease in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) concentration as well as with an increase in other components of the lipid profile (low-density lipoprotein (LDL), triglycerides, and total cholesterol). By decreasing HDL levels, cigarette smoking likely acts indirectly to induce a decline in PON1 activity.

PON1 and PON3 are plasma enzymes, structurally and functionally related to HDL, while PON2 is characterized by an intracellular location. Many polymorphisms of PON have been observed. The most widely and accurately described is the single nucleotide polymorphism, which impacts the conversion of glutamine (Q) to arginine (R) and has the effect of altering the hydrolytic activity of the PON1 form. Each PON form plays an important role in the human body, and they exhibit antioxidant, antiatherosclerotic, and anti-inflammatory influences. The PON family inhibits LDL oxidative modification and suppresses the differentiation of monocytes into macrophages, which is the first stage in the development of atherosclerosis. Furthermore, PON1 prevents the accumulation of oxidized LDL and stimulates cholesterol efflux from macrophages. Establishing these functions has led researchers to study the relationship between PON family and lipids in healthy subjects and in patients with diagnosed cardiovascular diseases. There is a certain relation between PON1 polymorphism and HDL and LDL particles. The PON1192RR genotype is associated with lower HDL levels and higher LDL levels.

Related enzymes PON2 and PON3 were named from their evolutionary relationship with PON1. Mice with each PON gene knocked out were generated at UCLA and have been key for elucidating their roles in organophosphorus (OP) metabolism, cardiovascular disease, innate immunity, obesity, and cancer. PON1 status, determined with two-substrate analyses, reveals an individual's functional Q192R genotype and activity levels. The three-dimensional structure for a chimeric PON1 has been useful for understanding the structural properties of PON1 and for engineering PON1 as a catalytic scavenger of OP compounds. All three PONs hydrolyze microbial N-acyl homoserine lactone quorum sensing factors, quenching Pseudomonas aeruginosa's pathogenesis. All three PONs modulate oxidative stress and inflammation. PON2 is localized in the mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum. PON2 has potent antioxidant properties and is found at 3- to 4-fold higher levels in females than males, providing increased protection against oxidative stress, as observed in primary cultures of neurons and astrocytes from female mice compared with male mice. The higher levels of PON2 in females may explain the lower frequency of neurological and cardiovascular diseases in females and the ability to identify males but not females with Parkinson's disease using a special PON1 status assay. Less is known about PON3; however, recent experiments with PON3 knockout mice show them to be susceptible to obesity, gallstone formation and atherosclerosis.

Initially identified in mammals, PON and PON-related genes have now been found in fowls, zebra fish, and even in invertebrates such as C. elegans. The more closely-related PON genes are divided into three classes or sub-families: PON1, PON2 and PON3, that share 60-70% sequence identity. PONs are calcium-dependent hydrolases that catalyze the hydrolysis of a broad range of esters and lactones. PON1, which is by far the most investigated member of this family, also catalyzes, albeit at much lower rates, the hydrolysis and thereby inactivation of various organophosphates (OPs), including the nerve agents sarin and soman. PON1 is also involved in drug metabolism and is used for drug inactivation. In recent years, it has become apparent that PONs also play an important role in the prevention of atherosclerosis. The levels of PON1 in the blood and its catalytic proficiency appear to have a major impact both on the individual's susceptibility to pollutants and insecticides, and to atherosclerosis. Furthermore, mice lacking the PON1 gene are highly susceptible to atherosclerosis and to OP poisoning. PON1 and PON3 reside in the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol-carrying particles known as HDL (\"good cholesterol\"). HDL has two key roles: mediation of cholesterol efflux, e.g., from macrophage foam cells in atherosclerotic lesions, and limitation of lipid oxidation in LDL.

Previous structure-activity relationship studies demonstrate that PONs have a high specificity for lipophilic lactones, suggesting that such compounds may be representative of native substrates. This report describes the ability of PONs to hydrolyze two bioactive \u03b4-lactones derived from arachidonic acid, 5,6-dihydroxy-eicosatrienoic acid lactone (5,6-DHTL) and cyclo-epoxycyclopentenone (cyclo-EC). Both lactones were very efficiently hydrolyzed by purified PON3. PON1 efficiently hydrolyzed 5,6-DHTL, but with a specific activity about 15-fold lower than PON3. 5,6-DHTL was a poor substrate for PON2. Cyclo-EC was a poor substrate for PON1 and not hydrolyzed by PON2. Studies with the PON inhibitor EDTA and a serine esterase inhibitor indicated that the PONs are the main contributors to hydrolysis of the lactones in human and mouse liver homogenates. Studies with homogenates from PON3 knockout mouse livers indicated that >80% of the 5,6-DHTL and cyclo-EC lactonase activities were attributed to PON3.

We have established that all three PONs are lactonases/lactonyzing enzymes with overlapping, but also distinct substrate specificity. Dihydrocoumarin (DHC), long chain fatty acid lactones and acylhomoserine lactones (AHLs) are hydrolyzed by all three PONs and likely represent their natural substrates. The 3D structure of PON1 is a six-bladed beta-propeller containing two Ca(2+) ions necessary for the enzyme stability and enzymatic activity. Senescence marker protein (SMP30), another putative six-bladed beta-propeller, hydrolyzes DFP, sarin and soman in the presence of Mg(2+) or Mn(2+). More recently, SMP30 was characterized as a gluconolactonase with a role in vitamin C metabolism.

Lactones are natural compounds, many of them with high biological activity, while organophosphates are human-made chemicals introduced in the 20th century.

Over the last decade, the introduction of CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) modulator drugs into clinical practice has profoundly modified the lives of many people with CF (PwCF) by targeting the fundamental cause of the disease. These drugs consist of the potentiator ivacaftor (VX-770) and the correctors lumacaftor (VX-809), tezacaftor (VX-661), and elexacaftor (VX-445). In particular, the triple combination of CFTR modulators composed of elexacaftor, tezacaftor, and ivacaftor (ETI) represents a life-changing therapy for the majority of PwCF worldwide. A growing number of clinical studies have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of ETI therapy in both short- and long-term (up to two years of follow-up to date) and its ability to significantly reduce pulmonary and gastrointestinal manifestations, sweat chloride concentration, exocrine pancreatic dysfunction, and infertility/subfertility, among other disease signs and symptoms. Nevertheless, ETI therapy-related adverse effects have also been reported, and close monitoring by a multidisciplinary healthcare team remains vital.

Phase 1 and 2a clinical studies indicated that weight-based nemolizumab dosing reduced pruritus in patients with moderate-to-severe AD with good safety and tolerability even at the highest dose (3 mg/kg single dose and 2 mg/kg multiple doses). Nemolizumab PK profile was characterized by a slow absorption with peak serum concentrations reached 4.5-9.2 days post-dose, and a long terminal half-life ranging from 12.6 to 16.5 days.

This study evaluated the pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety of nemolizumab in adolescents with moderate to severe AD as well as the relationship between nemolizumab concentrations and clinical efficacy and the effect of nemolizumab on protein biomarkers.\nMETHODS: Open-label, 16-week study of nemolizumab in patients aged 12-17\u00a0years with moderate to severe AD (baseline EASI\u2009\u2265\u200916, IGA\u2009\u2265\u20093, and BSA\u2009\u2265\u200910%) and associated pruritus with baseline average daily peak pruritus numeric rating scale (PP-NRS) intensity of at least 4. Nemolizumab was administered subcutaneously as a loading dose of 60\u00a0mg at baseline, followed by 30\u00a0mg every 4\u00a0weeks until week\u00a012 with background topical corticosteroids (TCS) or calcineurin inhibitors (TCI). Subsequently patients were followed for 8\u00a0weeks more. Stratum corneum (SC) and plasma samples were collected for biomarker assessments.\nRESULTS: Twenty patients participated, with a mean age of 14.8\u2009\u00b1\u20091.6\u00a0years. The PK of nemolizumab was described by a one-compartment model with linear elimination, a first-order absorption, and a mean half-life of 16.7\u2009\u00b1\u20094.1\u00a0days. Mean trough concentrations ranged from 2935\u2009\u00b1\u20091029\u00a0ng/mL to 3292\u2009\u00b1\u20092018\u00a0ng/mL over the 16-week treatment period. There was a marked improvement in rash, itch, and sleep with a decrease from baseline to week\u00a016 in EASI by 66.5\u2009\u00b1\u200932.5%, in PP-NRS by 43.2\u2009\u00b1\u200937%, and in sleep disturbance numeric rating scale by 53.5\u2009\u00b1\u200947.8%. The popPK and PK/PD analyses confirmed that model-predicted exposure and efficacy of nemolizumab were similar in adolescents compared to adults receiving the same dosing regimens. Age did not impact PK parameters, while the main source of PK variability was body weight. Analyses of SC samples identified a panel of AD-related pro-inflammatory biomarkers that were upregulated in lesional skin (compared to non-lesional skin) and correspondingly downregulated in clinical responders to nemolizumab (based on EASI75 and PP-NRS\u2009\u2265\u20094). Four biomarkers (CCL20, CCL22, CCL27, and VEGF) had changes that were 1.9-3.5-fold higher in EASI responders than in EASI non-responders (all p\u2009<\u20090.05). Analysis showed no significant correlation between plasma biomarkers and clinical scores. Adverse events were experienced by 33.3% of subjects (n\u2009=\u20096) and were primarily mild or moderate in severity.\nCONCLUSIONS: Nemolizumab PK and safety profiles in adolescents with moderate to severe AD are consistent with previous nemolizumab studies in adults. PK/PD models demonstrate similar exposure-response profiles in 12- to 17-year-old adolescents and adults for three clinical endpoints (EASI, IGA, and PP-NRS). Nemolizumab treatment reversed AD-related pro-inflammatory biomarkers in skin, indicating that the neuroimmune cytokine IL-31 is an important mediator of multiple pathways in AD.\nCLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT03921411.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35766128": "BACKGROUND: Patients with prurigo nodularis (PN) have multiple itchy nodules, impaired quality of life and sleep deprivation. Prurigo nodularis patients have a high burden of disease, primarily due to the intensity of the itch.

Generation and integration of patient data with RNA-Seq data generated from reconstructed human epidermis stimulated with IL-31 and other proinflammatory cytokines.\nRESULTS: Our results demonstrate that nemolizumab effectively decreases IL-31 responses in PN skin, leading to effective suppression of downstream inflammatory responses including T<sub>H</sub>2/IL-13 and T<sub>H</sub>17/IL-17 responses. This is accompanied by decreased keratinocyte proliferation and normalization of epidermal differentiation and function. Furthermore, our results demonstrate how transcriptomic changes associated with nemolizumab treatment correlate with improvement in lesions, pruritus, stabilization of extracellular matrix remodeling, and processes associated with cutaneous nerve function.\nCONCLUSION: These data demonstrate a broad response to IL-31 receptor inhibition with nemolizumab and confirm the critical upstream role of IL-31 in PN pathogenesis.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36839897": "Atopic dermatitis (AD), a pruritic, inflammatory chronic disease with multifactorial pathogenesis, has been a therapeutic challenge. Novel target treatments aim to reduce not only the immunologic dysfunction and microbiome dysbiosis but also the recovery of the damaged skin barrier. The current review focuses on the interleukin 31 (IL-31) pathway and AD and offers an overview of the current clinical studies with monoclonal antibodies blocking this cascade. Pruritus, the key symptom of AD, has substantial participation of the IL-31 complex and activation of relevant signaling pathways. Epidermal keratinocytes, inflammatory cells, and cutaneous peripheral nerves express the interleukin-31 receptor \u03b1-chain (IL-31RA), upregulated by Staphylococcus aureus toxins or Th2 cytokines involved in AD. Nemolizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that antagonizes IL-31RA, inhibiting the IL-31 cascade and therefore contributing to reducing the pruritus and inflammation and recovering the damaged skin barrier in AD patients. Phases 2 and 3 clinical trials with nemolizumab in AD show a suitable safety profile, with a fast, efficient, and sustained reduction of pruritus and severity scores, especially when associated with topical treatment.

High mortality is found in all age groups, resulting in a life expectancy of approximately 20 years below that of the general population. Evidence suggests that persons with schizophrenia may not have seen the same improvement in life expectancy as the general population during the past decades.

Melanoma therapy with antibodies against CTLA-4 provided the proof of concept that solid cancers can be susceptible to cancer immunotherapy, and melanoma therapy with antibodies against PD-1 resulted in the clinical breakthrough of cancer immunotherapy. Still, about half of patients die from metastatic melanoma. Combining anti\u2012PD-1 with anti\u2012CTLA-4 antibodies to increase antitumor immune responses or with targeted therapy improves the overall survival only partially. Recent data revealed a close link between defects in the IFN-\u03b3\u2012dependent induction of cell cycle control genes and resistance to immunotherapy, which may allow for identifying those patients that respond to immunotherapy and to develop novel therapies, combining cancer immunotherapy with cell cycle inhibitors.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27454404": "Melanoma remains a leading cause of death among young adults. Evidence that melanoma tumor cells are highly immunogenic and a better understanding of T-cell immune checkpoints have changed the therapeutic approach to advanced melanoma.

These changes sustain the TME for response to immunotherapy.

The most extensively studied checkpoints represent cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein-4 (CTLA-4) and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1). Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), which were broadly applied for melanoma treatment in the past decade, can unleash anti-tumor immune responses and result in melanoma regression. Patients responding to the ICI treatment showed long-lasting remission or disease control status. However, a large group of patients failed to respond to this therapy, indicating the development of resistance mechanisms. Among them are intrinsic tumor properties, the dysfunction of effector cells, and the generation of immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). This review discusses achievements of ICI treatment in melanoma, reasons for its failure, and promising approaches for overcoming the resistance. These methods include combinations of different ICI with each other, strategies for neutralizing the immunosuppressive TME and combining ICI with other anti-cancer therapies such as radiation, oncolytic viral, or targeted therapy.

Even when considering double immune checkpoint blockade with anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1, we still have far to go in melanoma treatment as 50% of patients with metastatic disease do not respond to current treatment. Alternative immunotherapy should therefore be considered. Since melanoma has a high mutational burden, it is considered more immunogenic than many other tumours. T cell receptor (TCR) therapy could be a possible way forward, either alone or in combination, to improve the response rates of this deadly disease. Melanoma is one of the cancers where TCR therapy has been frequently applied.

In this Review we challenge the widely accepted view that irritable bowel syndrome is an unexplained brain-gut disorder. There is epidemiological evidence that, in a major subset of patients, gastrointestinal symptoms arise first and only later do incident mood disorders occur. Additionally, possible mechanisms for gut-brain dysfunction have been identified, suggesting primary gut disturbances might be the underlying cause in a subgroup. Underlying mechanisms that could lead to irritable bowel syndrome include genetic factors (most notably an identified mutation of SCN5A); post-infectious changes, chronic infections and disturbances in the intestinal microbiota; low-grade mucosal inflammation, immune activation, and altered intestinal permeability; disordered bile salt metabolism (in 10-20% of cases with diarrhoea); abnormalities in serotonin metabolism; and alterations in brain function, which could be primary or secondary factors. Identical irritable bowel syndrome symptoms are probably due to different disease processes; grouping patients with this disorder into either diarrhoea-predominant or constipation-predominant subtypes promotes heterogeneity.

The present study endeavors to investigate whether FAM134B is expressed in House Ear Institute-Organ of Corti 1 (HEI-OC1) and C57BL/6 murine cochlear hair cells (HCs), and to explore its potential function in cisplatin-mediated ototoxicity, with the aim of discovering new insights that can mitigate or forestall the irreversible adverse effect of cisplatin.\nMETHODS: Immunofluorescence (IF) staining was used to test the expression pattern of FAM134B, levels of C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP), autophagy, and co-localization ratio of lysosomes and ER. Western blotting was employed to measure changes in expression levels of FAM134B, LC3B, ER stress-related proteins, LAMP1 and apoptotic mediators. Cell apoptosis was examined using transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay and flow cytometry.\nRESULTS: In the present investigation, it was observed that FAM134B exhibited a diffuse expression pattern in the cytoplasm and nuclei of control HEI-OC1 cells. Following cisplatin administration, FAM134B was found to accumulate and form distinct dots around the nuclei, concomitant with increased levels of ER-phagy, ER stress, unfolded protein response (UPR), and cell apoptosis. Additionally, knockdown of FAM134B resulted in reduced ER-phagy, mitigated ER stress and UPR, and decreased apoptotic activity in HEI-OC1 cells following cisplatin exposure.\nCONCLUSIONS: Collectively, the findings of this study demonstrate that FAM134B-mediated ER-phagy enhances the susceptibility of HCs to ER stress and apoptosis in response to cisplatin-induced stress. This suggests a sequential progression of ER-phagy, ER stress and apoptosis following cisplatin stimulus, and implies the potential therapeutic benefit of inhibiting of FAM134B-mediated ER-phagy in the prevention of cisplatin-related ototoxicity.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37728036": "Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress can stimulate the proliferation and metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells while hindering apoptosis and immune system function, but the molecular mechanism of ER stress in HCC has yet to be fully studied.

Abnormalities in O-GlcNAcylation and ER-phagy have been documented in a wide variety of human pathologies. However, whether O-GlcNAcylation or ER-phagy is involved in the pathogenesis of intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) is largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the function of O-GlcNAcylation and ER-phagy and the related underlying mechanisms in IDD. We found that the expression profiles of O-GlcNAcylation and O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) were notably increased in degenerated NP tissues and nutrient-deprived nucleus pulposus (NP) cells. By modulating the O-GlcNAc level through genetic manipulation and specific pharmacological intervention, we revealed that increasing O-GlcNAcylation abundance substantially enhanced cell function and facilitated cell survival under nutrient deprivation (ND) conditions. Moreover, FAM134B-mediated ER-phagy activation was regulated by O-GlcNAcylation, and suppression of ER-phagy by FAM134B knockdown considerably counteracted the protective effects of amplified O-GlcNAcylation. Mechanistically, FAM134B was determined to be a potential target of OGT, and O-GlcNAcylation of FAM134B notably reduced FAM134B ubiquitination-mediated degradation. Correspondingly, the protection conferred by modulating O-GlcNAcylation homeostasis was verified in a rat IDD model. Our data demonstrated that OGT directly associates with and stabilizes FAM134B and subsequently enhances FAM134B-mediated ER-phagy to enhance the adaptive capability of cells in response to nutrient deficiency.

Under ER-stress conditions, activated CAMK2B phosphorylates the reticulon-homology domain of FAM134B, which enhances FAM134B oligomerization and activity in membrane fragmentation to accommodate high demand for ER-phagy. Unexpectedly, FAM134B G216R, a variant derived from a type II hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy (HSAN) patient, exhibits gain-of-function defects, such as hyperactive self-association and membrane scission, which results in excessive ER-phagy and sensory neuron death. Therefore, this study reveals a mechanism of ER membrane fragmentation in ER-phagy, along with a signaling pathway in regulating ER turnover, and suggests a potential implication of excessive selective autophagy in human diseases.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33199694": "FAM134B (also called JK-1, RETREG1), a member of the family with sequence similarity 134, was originally discovered as an oncogene in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.

In this study, we investigated the function of FAM134B in HCC and the related tumorigenesis mechanisms, as well as how FAM134B induces EMT. We detected the expression of FAM134B in a normal hepatic cell line, HCC cell lines, fresh specimens, and a HCC tissue microarray. A retrospective study of 122 paired HCC tissue microarrays was used to analyze the correlation between FAM134B and clinical features. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments, rescue experiments, Akt pathway activator/inhibitors, nude mice xenograft models, and nude mice lung metastasis models were used to determine the underlying mechanisms of FAM134B in inducing tumorigenesis and EMT in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo. The expression level of FAM134B was highly elevated in HCC, as compared with that in normal liver tissues and normal hepatic cells. Overexpression of FAM134B was significantly associated with tumor size (P\u00a0=\u00a00.025), pathological vascular invasion (P\u00a0=\u00a00.026), differentiation grade (P\u00a0=\u00a00.023), cancer recurrence (P\u00a0=\u00a00.044), and portal vein tumor thrombus (P\u00a0=\u00a00.036) in HCC.

Using molecular modeling and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we assemble a structural model for the RHD of FAM134B. Through MD simulations of FAM134B in flat and curved membranes, we relate the dynamic RHD structure with its two wedge-shaped transmembrane helical hairpins and two amphipathic helices to FAM134B functions in membrane-curvature induction and curvature-mediated protein sorting.

Accordingly, DENV and ZIKV restrict ER turnover by protease-mediated cleavage of reticulophagy regulator 1 (RETREG1), also known as FAM134B, an autophagy receptor responsible for targeted ER sheet degradation. Given that the induction of autophagy may play an important role in flavivirus replication, the antiviral role of RETREG1 suggests that specialized autophagic pathways may have differential effects on the flavivirus life cycle. We previously identified BPI fold-containing family B member 3 (BPIFB3) as a regulator of autophagy that negatively controls enterovirus replication. Here, we show that in contrast to enteroviruses, BPIFB3 functions as a positive regulator of DENV and ZIKV infection and that its RNA interference-mediated silencing inhibits the formation of viral replication organelles. Mechanistically, we show that depletion of BPIFB3 enhances RETREG1-dependent reticulophagy, leading to enhanced ER turnover and the suppression of viral replication. Consistent with this, the antiviral effects of BPIFB3 depletion can be reversed by RETREG1 silencing, suggesting a specific role for BPIFB3 in regulating ER turnover. These studies define BPIFB3 as a required host factor for both DENV and ZIKV replication and further contribute to our understanding of the requirements for autophagy during flavivirus infection.IMPORTANCE Flaviviruses and other arthropod-transmitted viruses represent a widespread global health problem, with limited treatment options currently available. Thus, a better understanding of the cellular requirements for their infection is needed. Both DENV and ZIKV rely on expansion of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the induction of autophagy to establish productive infections. However, little is known regarding the interplay between the requirements for autophagy initiation during infection and the mechanisms used by these viruses to avoid clearance through the autophagic pathway.

This review aimed to summarize various functions of FAM134B since our first discovery of the gene in 2001. The protein encoded by FAM134B is a reticulophagy receptor that regulates turnover of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by selective phagocytosis. Absence or non-functional expression of FAM134B protein impairs ER-turnover and thereby is involved in the pathogenesis of some human diseases. FAM134B inhibition contributes to impair proteostasis in the ER due to the accumulation of misfolded or aggregated proteins, which in turn leads to compromised neuronal survival and progressive neuronal degenerative diseases. Mutations in FAM134B associated with hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type IIB (HSAN IIB). Selective cleavage of FAM134B by Dengue, Zika, and West Nile virus encoded protease NS2B3 leads to the increased production of infection units, whereas upregulation of FAM134B inhibits viral replication. In cancer, FAM134B acts as a tumor suppressor and inhibit cancer growth both in-vitro and in-vivo. Pharmacological upregulation of FAM134B resulted in reduced cancer cell growth and proliferation. In addition, FAM134B mutations are common in patients with colorectal adenocarcinoma, and oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma.

Congenital mutations in the FAM134B gene have been reported to be associated with hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type 2B (HSAN2B); however, the molecular differences between wild-type and HSAN2B-linked FAM134B are not fully understood.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: We prepared several human FAM134B constructs, such as the HSAN2B-linked mutant, and compared their features with those of wild-type FAM134B by transfecting these constructs into FAM134B-deficient Neuro2a cells. Although intrinsic FAM134B protein expression in wild-type Neuro2a cells was affected by the supply of amino acids in the culture medium, the expression of each HSAN2B-linked mutant FAM134B protein was hardly affected by serum and amino acid deprivation. On the other hand, the intracellular localization of GFP-tagged HSAN2B-linked mutants, except for P7Gfs133X, overlapped well with ER-localized SP-RFP<sub>KDEL</sub> and did not differ from that of GFP-tagged wild-type FAM134B. However, analysis of protein\u2012protein interactions using the NanoBiT reporter assay revealed the difference between wild-type and C-terminal truncated mutant FAM134B. Furthermore, this NanoBiT assay demonstrated that both wild-type and G216R FAM134B interacted with LC3/GABARAPL1 to the same extent, but the FAM134B construct with mutations near the LC3-interacting region (LIR) did not.

During this process, the ER-phagy receptor FAM134B anchors and fragments ER, and then binds with LC3 to form autophagosomes. These results suggest that ER-phagy is involved in the skeletal muscle cell response to exercise stress, which helps to maintain cellular ER homeostasis during exercise.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34210752": "In melanoma metastasis, the role of the AP-2\u03b1 transcription factor, which is encoded by TFAP2A, is controversial as some findings have suggested tumor suppressor activity while other studies have shown high TFAP2A expression in node-positive melanoma associated with poor prognosis. Here we demonstrate that AP-2\u03b1 facilitates melanoma metastasis through transcriptional activation of genes within the E2F pathway including EZH2. A BioID screen found that AP-2\u03b1 interacts with members of the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex. Loss of AP-2\u03b1 removed activating chromatin marks in the promoters of EZH2 and other E2F target genes through activation of the NuRD repression complex. In melanoma cells, treatment with tazemetostat, an FDA-approved and highly specific EZH2 inhibitor, substantially reduced anchorage-independent colony formation and demonstrated heritable antimetastatic effects, which were dependent on AP-2\u03b1. Single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of a metastatic melanoma mouse model revealed hyperexpansion of Tfap2a High/E2F-activated cell populations in transformed melanoma relative to progenitor melanocyte stem cells. These findings demonstrate that melanoma metastasis is driven by the AP-2\u03b1/EZH2 pathway and suggest that AP-2\u03b1 expression can be used as a biomarker to predict responsiveness to EZH2 inhibitors for the treatment of advanced melanomas.

While TFAP2D is not well studied, here, we mainly focus on the other four TFAP2 members. As a transcription factor, TFAP2 regulates the downstream targets directly by binding to their regulatory region. In addition, the regulation of downstream targets by epigenetic modification, posttranslational regulation, and interaction with noncoding RNA have also been identified. According to the pathways in which the downstream targets are involved in, the regulatory effects of TFAP2 on tumorigenesis are generally summarized as follows: stemness and EMT, interaction between TFAP2 and tumor microenvironment, cell cycle and DNA damage repair, ER- and ERBB2-related signaling pathway, ferroptosis and therapeutic response.

However, its downstream targets in bladder urothelial carcinoma (BLCA), the most malignant cancer of the urinary tract, remain unclear. In the current study, we aim to explore the function and mechanism of TFAP2A in BLCA.\nMETHODS: TFAP2A expression and the prognostic significance in BLCA was analyzed using TCGA and GTEX projects. TFAP2A was knocked-down in BLCA cells to study its impact on glucose uptake, lactate and ATP production, expression of HK2, and the number of vascular meshes formed by HUVEC. The target long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) of TFAP2A were predicted by bioinformatics tools, followed by ChIP-qPCR and luciferase assays. The downstream targets of TPRG1-AS1 were analyzed by microarray analysis. Rescue experiments were conducted for validation.\nRESULTS: TFAP2A upregulation in BLCA predicted dismal survival of patients. Loss of TFAP2A inhibited glycolysis (as evidenced by reduced glucose uptake, lactate, ATP production, and the expression of HK2) and angiogenesis (decreased number of vascular meshes formed by HUVEC). TFAP2A promoted the transcription of TPRG1-AS1. TPRG1-AS1 reversed the inhibitory effect of TFAP2A knockdown on glycolysis and angiogenesis in BLCA cells. TPRG1-AS1 inhibited the transcription of CRTAC1 by recruiting a DNA methyltransferase to the promoter of CRTAC1 and increasing the DNA methylation of its promoter. CRTAC1 inhibited glycolysis and angiogenesis in BLCA cells.

We proved LUAD possessed universal TFAP2A high expression, indicating a pervasively poorer prognosis in multiple independent datasets. Then we found TFAP2A was not indispensable for LUAD proliferation, and exogenous overexpression even caused repression. However, we found TFAP2A could potently promote LUAD metastasis possibly by triggering epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we demonstrated TFAP2A could transactivate Pregnancy-specific glycoprotein 9 (PSG9) to enhance transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2)-triggering EMT in LUAD. Meanwhile, we discovered suppressed post-transcriptional silencing of miR-16 family upon TFAP2A partly contributed to TFAP2A upregulation in LUAD. In clinical specimens, we also validated cancer-regulating effect of miR-16 family/TFAP2A/PSG9 axis, especially for lymph node metastasis of LUAD.

They are categorized into functional groups of carcinogenesis, metabolism and others. A combination of sequence analysis, reporter gene assays, quantitative real-time PCR, electrophoretic gel mobility shift assays and immunoblot analysis further confirmed the four AP-2gamma target genes in carcinogenesis group: ErbB2, CDH2, HPSE and IGSF11. Our results were consistent with the previous reports that ErbB2 was the target gene of AP-2gamma.

We have shown previously that although AP-2 is expressed highly in normal prostatic epithelium, its expression is lost in high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and prostate cancer, suggesting that loss of AP-2 plays a role in prostate cancer development. We demonstrate that forced AP-2 expression in the prostate cancer cell line LNCaP-LN3 (AP-2 negative) inhibited dramatically tumor incidence in nude mice. To identify the genes that might have been responsible for this effect, we used microchip expression array. We found several genes known to be involved in malignancy were deregulated, including the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene. Because VEGF was down-regulated by 14.7-fold in the AP-2-transfected cells and because it is a major angiogenic factor in prostate cancer development and progression, we chose to examine the AP-2-VEGF interaction. Our evidence suggests that AP-2 repressed transcriptionally the VEGF promoter by competing with the transcriptional activator Sp3.

We found TFAP2A is also required for the activation of Pol III transcription induced by the silencing of filamin A, a well-known cytoskeletal protein and an inhibitor in Pol III-dependent transcription identified previously. Using a chromatin immunoprecipitation technique, we showed TFAP2A positively modulates the assembly of Pol III transcription machinery factors at Pol III-transcribed gene loci.

Correlation has been found between the presence of mutations in the K-ras gene and resistance to treatment with Cetuximab.New guidelines require K-ras mutation analysis before anti-EGFR treatment is provided. The proteins Amphiregulin and Epiregulin belong to the Epidermal growth factors family (EGF, that act through the EGFR. Over-expression of these proteins has been seen in a variety of malignancies and non-malignant pathologies. These proteins can be detected in samples from colorectal malignancies and inflammatory bowel disease by immunohistochemical staining. Jacobs et at showed that mRNA expression of these proteins n colorectal malignancy predicts outcomes in wild type K-ras metastatic patients treated with Cetuximab.\nAIM: The purpose of our study is to examine whether there is a correlation between the presence of colorectal cancer K-ras mutations and the level of expression of EpireguLin and Amphiregulin in the malignant tissue.\nMATERIAL AND METHODS: In a retrospective study we examined 30 tissue samples of colon cancer patients for the presence of K-ras mutation and immunohistochemicaL staining for Epiregulin and AmphireguLin.\nRESULTS: A total of 14 (46.66%] samples showed mutation in the K-ras gene; 15 of 30 samples [50%] were positive for AmphireguLin. As for Epiregulin, 10 (33.3%) samples had strong staining, 10 (33.3%) samples had Light staining and the rest, 10 (33.3%) didn't have any staining.

However, the potential pharmacogenetic role of other EGFR ligands such as amphiregulin (AREG) and epiregulin (EREG) has not been elucidated. We studied 74 KRAS and BRAF wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer patients treated with anti-EGFR plus irinotecan. Twenty-two genetic variants in EGFR, EGF, AREG and EREG genes were selected using HapMap database and literature resources. Three tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the AREG gene region (rs11942466 C>A, rs13104811 A>G, and rs9996584 C>T) predicted disease control in the multivariate analyses. AREG rs11942466 C>A and rs9996584 C>T were also associated with overall survival (OS). The functional polymorphism, EGFR rs712829 G>T, was associated with progression-free and OS.

Upon treatment of colorectal cancer cells with 5-aza-2'-desoxycytidine, methylation decreases at specific intragenic CpGs accompanied by upregulation of AREG and EREG gene expression. The same AREG gene-body methylation was also found in human colorectal cancer samples and is independent of KRAS and NRAS mutations. Methylation is specifically decreased in the tumor epithelial compartment as compared to stromal tissue and normal epithelium. Investigation of a promoter/enhancer function of the AREG exon 2 region revealed a potential promoter function in reverse orientation. Retrospective comparison of the predictive power of AREG gene-body methylation versus AREG gene expression using samples from colorectal cancer patients treated with anti-EGFR inhibitors with complete clinical follow-up revealed that AREG expression is superior to AREG gene methylation.

RNA expression of EGFR ligands epiregulin (EREG) and amphiregulin (AREG) may correlate with EGFR-targeted therapy efficacy in aCRC, so may represent a much-needed additional predictive marker for these drugs.\nOBJECTIVE: To examine a novel ligand model in a randomized clinical trial of panitumumab, irinotecan, and ciclosporin in colorectal cancer (PICCOLO) with with the a priori hypothesis that high tumor expression of either AREG or EREG would predict panitumumab therapy benefit in RAS-wt patients; and low expression, lack of efficacy.\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Prospectively planned retrospective biomarker study from the PICCOLO trial, which tested the addition of panitumumab to irinotecan therapy in patients with KRAS wt aCRC who experienced failure with prior fluoropyrimidine treatment. The analysis was conducted between 2012 and 2014. A predefined dichotomous model classified tumors as \"high expressor\" (either EREG or AREG in top tertile for messenger RNA level) or \"low expressor\" (neither EREG nor AREG in top tertile). Ligand expression was assessed as a prognostic and predictive biomarker. Expression of AREG/EREG and RAS and BRAF mutations were assessed in archival tumor tissue.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS); secondary end points were response rate and overall survival (OS).\nRESULTS: Of the 696 PICCOLO trial patients in the irinotecan-vs-irinotecan with panitumumab randomization, 331 had sufficient tumor tissue available and measurement of ligand expression was successful in 323. High ligand expression was not prognostic for OS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.79 [95% CI, 0.58-1.09]; P\u2009=\u2009.15) or PFS (HR, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.68-1.27]; P\u2009=\u2009.64). The primary population had RAS wt aCRC (n\u2009=\u2009220); for RAS wt patients with high ligand expression, median (interquartile range [IQR]) PFS was 8.3 [4.0-11.0] months (irinotecan with panitumumab) vs 4.4 [2.8-6.7] months (irinotecan alone); HR, 0.38 [95% CI, 0.24-0.61]; P\u2009<\u2009.001). In RAS wt patients with low ligand expression, median (IQR) PFS was 3.2 [2.7-8.1] months (irinotecan with panitumumab) vs 4.0 [2.7-7.5] months (irinotecan); HR, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.64-1.37]; P\u2009=\u2009.73; interaction test results were significant [P\u2009=\u2009.01]).

First, upstream molecules, including epiregulin (EREG) and amphiregulin (AREG), might play different roles according to their abnormal levels in tumor tissue and serum. Second, the EGFR amplification and distinct polymorphisms may have roles in identifying patients for initial anti-EGFR mAbs therapy, while rare EGFR mutations have limited predictive values. Third, among the downstream molecularly related factors, rat sarcoma viral oncogene (Ras) has been identified as a successful predictor, while B-Raf proto-oncogene (BRAF) is considered as a prognostic factor rather than a predictor. Fourth, among the molecular bypass pathway components, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) may be potential biomarkers in the future, while activation of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/c-Met signaling confers resistance to anti-EGFR therapy.

Epiregulin (EREG) is one of the EGFR ligands and is low expressed in most normal tissues. Elevated EREG in various cancers mainly activates EGFR signaling pathways and promotes cancer progression. Notably, a higher EREG expression level in CRC with wild-type Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) is related to better efficacy of therapeutic treatment.

Movement behavior was assessed while the participant engaged in everyday activities using a 17-sensor bodysuit during three clinical visits over the course of 12 months. We first defined new movement behavioral fingerprints capable of distinguishing DMD from controls. Then, we used machine learning algorithms that combined the behavioral fingerprints to make cross-sectional and longitudinal disease course predictions, which outperformed predictions derived from currently used clinical assessments. Finally, using Bayesian optimization, we constructed a behavioral biomarker, termed the KineDMD ethomic biomarker, which is derived from daily-life behavioral data and whose value progresses with age in an S-shaped sigmoid curve form. The biomarker developed in this study, derived from digital readouts of daily-life movement behavior, can predict disease progression in patients with muscular dystrophy and can potentially track the response to therapy.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37124497": "Neoepitopes have attracted much attention as targets for immunotherapy against cancer. Therefore, efficient neoepitope screening technology is an essential step in the development of personalized vaccines. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are generated by back-splicing and have a single-stranded continuous circular structure. So far, various circRNAs have been poorly characterized, though new evidence suggests that a few translated circRNAs may play a role in cancer. In the present study, circRNA was used as a source of neoepitope, a novel strategy as circRNA-derived neoepitopes have never been previously explored. The present study reports CIRC_neo (circRNA-derived neoepitope prediction pipeline), which is a comprehensive and automated bioinformatic pipeline for the prediction of circRNA-derived neoepitopes from RNA sequencing data. The computational prediction from sequencing data requires complex computational workflows to identify circRNAs, derive the resulting peptides, infer the types of human leukocyte antigens (HLA I and HLA II) in patients, and predict the neoepitopes binding to these antigens. The present study proposes a novel source of neoepitopes. The study focused on cancer-specific circRNAs, which have greatly expanded the source pool for neoepitope discovery. The statistical analysis of different features of circRNA-derived neoepitopes revealed that circRNAs could produce long proteins or truncated proteins. Because the peptides were completely foreign to the human body, they could be highly immunogenic. Importantly, circRNA-derived neoepitopes capable of binding to HLA were discovered.

We identified four circLSD1-RNAs by RT-PCR with divergent primers, followed by sequencing. The expression level of circLSD1-RNAs was then studied by quantitative PCR on cellular and extracellular fractions of lung cancer (PC9) and non-cancer primary small airway epithelial (PSAE) cells. Moreover, we established the transgenic overexpression of circLSD1-RNAs. We show that circLSD1-RNAs are primarily located in the cytoplasm, but are packaged and released from lung cancer and non-cancer cells by extracellular vesicles (EVs) and ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes, respectively. Proteomics demonstrated a different protein pattern of EV fractions released from PC9 versus PSAE cells. Importantly, released circLSD1-RNAs were differently taken up by PSAE and PC9 cells.

Those generated through a failure of intron lariat debranching are the best known, even though studies on them are rare. These circRNAs retain the 2'-5' bond derived from the intron lariat, and this feature probably explains the difficulties in obtaining efficient reverse transcription through the circular junction. Here, we provide an unprecedented overview of non-canonical circRNAs (lariat-derived intronic circRNAs, sub-exonic circRNAs, intron circles, tricRNAs), which all derive from non-coding sequences. As there are few data suggesting their involvement in cellular regulatory processes, we believe that it is early to propose a general function for circRNAs, even for lariat-derived circRNAs.

In Rbm20 KO hearts, we identified 38 differentially expressed circRNAs of which 12 were produced from the Ttn gene. Even though Ttn appeared the most prominent target of Rbm20 for circularization, we also detected Rbm20-dependent circRNAs arising from other genes including Fan1, Stk39, Xdh, Bcl2l13, and Sorbs1 Interestingly, only Ttn circRNAs seemed to arise from Rbm20-mediated skipped exons.

Here, with the upgraded CIRCexplorer2 pipeline, we systematically annotated different types of alternative back-splicing and alternative splicing events in circRNAs from various cell lines. Compared with their linear cognate RNAs, circRNAs exhibited distinct patterns of alternative back-splicing and alternative splicing. Alternative back-splice site selection was correlated with the competition of putative RNA pairs across introns that bracket alternative back-splice sites.

Unexpectedly, thousands of previously unannotated exons were detected in circRNAs from the examined cell lines. Although these novel exons had similar splice site strength, they were much less conserved than known exons in sequences.

Some circRNAs accumulate to higher levels than their associated linear mRNAs, especially in the nervous system, and have clear regulatory functions that result in organismal phenotypes. The pre-mRNA splicing machinery generates circRNAs via backsplicing reactions, which are often facilitated by intronic repeat sequences that base pair to one another and bring the intervening splice sites into close proximity. When spliceosomal components are limiting, circRNAs can become the preferred gene output, and backsplicing reactions are further controlled by exon skipping events and the combinatorial action of RNA binding proteins. This allows circRNAs to be expressed in a tissue- and stage-specific manner. Once generated, circRNAs are highly stable transcripts that often accumulate in the cytoplasm. The functions of most circRNAs remain unknown, but some can regulate the activities of microRNAs or be translated to produce proteins. Circular RNAs can further interface with the immune system as well as control gene expression events in the nucleus, including alternative splicing decisions. Circular RNAs thus represent a large class of RNA molecules that are tightly regulated, and it is becoming increasingly clear that they likely impact many biological processes.

Due to the complexity of the pathophysiological processes of AIDs, clinical therapeutics have been suboptimal. The emergence of circRNAs sheds new light on the treatment of AIDs. In particular, circRNAs mainly participate in the occurrence and development of AIDs by sponging targets.

They were originally thought to represent errors in splicing and considered to be of low abundance, however, there is now an increased appreciation of their important function in gene regulation. circRNAs are differentially generated by backsplicing of exons or from lariat introns. Unlike linear RNA, the 3' and 5' ends normally present in an RNA molecule have been joined together by covalent bonds leading to circularization. Interestingly, they have been found to be abundant, evolutionally conserved and relatively stable in the cytoplasm. These features confer numerous potential functions to circRNAs, such as acting as miRNA sponges, or binding to RNA-associated proteins to form RNA-protein complexes that regulate gene transcription. It has been proposed that circRNA regulate gene expression at the transcriptional or post-transcriptional level by interacting with miRNAs and that circRNAs may have a role in regulating miRNA function in cancer initiation and progression. circRNAs appear to be more often downregulated in tumor tissue compared to normal tissue and this may be due to (i) errors in the back-splice machinery in malignant tissues, (ii) degradation of circRNAs by deregulated miRNAs in tumor tissue, or (iii) increasing cell proliferation leading to a reduction of circRNAs. circRNAs have been identified in exosomes and more recently, chromosomal translocations in cancer have been shown to generate aberrant fusion-circRNAs associated with resistance to drug treatments. In addition, though originally thought to be non-coding, there is now increasing evidence to suggest that select circRNAs can be translated into functional proteins.

At least in some archaeal species, circRNAs are formed by a ligation step catalyzed by an atypic homodimeric RNA ligase belonging to Rnl3 family.

Here, we report that circRNAs can be used as bona fide biomarkers of functional, exon-skipped AS variants in Arabidopsis, including in the homeotic MADS-box transcription factor family. Furthermore, we demonstrate that circRNAs derived from exon 6 of the SEPALLATA3 (SEP3) gene increase abundance of the cognate exon-skipped AS variant (SEP3.3 which lacks exon 6), in turn driving floral homeotic phenotypes. Toward demonstrating the underlying mechanism, we show that the SEP3 exon 6 circRNA can bind strongly to its cognate DNA locus, forming an RNA:DNA hybrid, or R-loop, whereas the linear RNA equivalent bound significantly more weakly to DNA. R-loop formation results in transcriptional pausing, which has been shown to coincide with splicing factor recruitment and AS2-4.

We could demonstrate that circRNAs are packaged and released within both types of vesicles (microvesicles and exosomes) derived from platelets. Interestingly, we observed a selective release of circRNAs into the vesicles, suggesting a specific sorting mechanism. In sum, circRNAs represent yet another class of extracellular RNAs that circulate in the body and may be involved in signalling pathways.

Mezigdomide is a novel cereblon E3 ubiquitin ligase modulator with potent antiproliferative and tumoricidal activity in preclinical models of multiple myeloma, including those resistant to lenalidomide and pomalidomide.\nMETHODS: In this phase 1-2 study, we administered oral mezigdomide in combination with dexamethasone to patients with relapsed and refractory myeloma. The primary objectives of phase 1 (dose-escalation cohort) were to assess safety and pharmacokinetics and to identify the dose and schedule for phase 2. In phase 2 (dose-expansion cohort), objectives included the assessment of the overall response (partial response or better), safety, and efficacy of mezigdomide plus dexamethasone at the dose and schedule determined in phase 1.\nRESULTS: In phase 1, a total of 77 patients were enrolled in the study. The most common dose-limiting toxic effects were neutropenia and febrile neutropenia. On the basis of the phase 1 findings, investigators determined the recommended phase 2 dose of mezigdomide to be 1.0 mg, given once daily in combination with dexamethasone for 21 days, followed by 7 days off, in each 28-day cycle. In phase 2, a total of 101 patients received the dose identified in phase 1 in the same schedule. All patients in the dose-expansion cohort had triple-class-refractory multiple myeloma, 30 patients (30%) had received previous anti-B-cell maturation antigen (anti-BCMA) therapy, and 40 (40%) had plasmacytomas. The most common adverse events, almost all of which proved to be reversible, included neutropenia (in 77% of the patients) and infection (in 65%; grade 3, 29%; grade 4, 6%). No unexpected toxic effects were encountered. An overall response occurred in 41% of the patients (95% confidence interval [CI], 31 to 51), the median duration of response was 7.6 months (95% CI, 5.4 to 9.5; data not mature), and the median progression-free survival was 4.4 months (95% CI, 3.0 to 5.5), with a median follow-up of 7.5 months (range, 0.5 to 21.9).\nCONCLUSIONS: The all-oral combination of mezigdomide plus dexamethasone showed promising efficacy in patients with heavily pretreated multiple myeloma, with treatment-related adverse events consisting mainly of myelotoxic effects.

The population PK parameters of absorption rate constant, lag time, central volume of distribution, clearance, peripheral volume of distribution, and intercompartmental clearance were estimated to be 1.18\u2009h-1 (interoccasion variability [IOV]: 65%), 0.423\u2009h (IOV: 31%), 440\u2009L (interindividual variability [IIV]: 63%), 35.1\u2009L/h (IIV: 40%), 243\u2009L (IIV: 26%), and 36.8\u2009L/h (IIV: 26%), respectively. High-fat meal increased oral bioavailability by ~30% and PPI co-administration decreased oral bioavailability by ~64%. Mezigdomide demonstrated a linear dose-exposure relationship in HSs. The PK model suggests a modest effect of high-fat meal, and a substantial effect of PPIs on mezigdomide oral bioavailability.

The mTOR pathway, particularly mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1), has been shown to control aging, lifespan, and healthspan through the regulation of protein synthesis, autophagy, mitochondrial function, and metabolic health. The mTOR pathway also plays critical roles in the heart, from cardiac development, growth and maturation, and maintenance of cardiac homeostasis. Hyperactivation of mTORC1 signaling is well documented in aging and many age-related pathologies, including age-related cardiac dysfunction and heart failure. Suppression of mTORC1 by calorie restriction or rapamycin not only extends lifespan but also restores youthful phenotypes in the heart. In this article, we review model organisms of cardiac aging and highlight recent advances in the impact of the mTORC1 pathway on organismal and cardiac aging, particularly in Drosophila and mice. We focus on the downstream signaling pathways S6 kinase and 4EBP1, which regulates protein synthesis, as well as ULK1 and its related pathway that regulates autophagy.

In response to insulin and nutrients, mTORC1, consisting of mTOR, raptor (regulatory-associated protein of mTOR), and mLST8, is activated and phosphorylates eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein (4EBP) and p70 S6 kinase to promote protein synthesis and cell size. Previously we found that activation of mTOR kinase in response to insulin was associated with increased 4EBP1 binding to raptor. Here we identify prolinerich Akt substrate 40 (PRAS40) as a binding partner for mTORC1. A putative TOR signaling motif, FVMDE, is identified in PRAS40 and shown to be required for interaction with raptor. Insulin stimulation markedly decreases the level of PRAS40 bound by mTORC1. Recombinant PRAS40 inhibits mTORC1 kinase activity in vivo and in vitro, and this inhibition depends on PRAS40 association with raptor. Furthermore, decreasing PRAS40 expression by short hairpin RNA enhances 4E-BP1 binding to raptor, and recombinant PRAS40 competes with 4E-BP1 binding to raptor. We, therefore, propose that PRAS40 regulates mTORC1 kinase activity by functioning as a direct inhibitor of substrate binding.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21576368": "The mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) functions as an environmental sensor to promote critical cellular processes such as protein synthesis, cell growth, and cell proliferation in response to growth factors and nutrients.

By employing mass spectrometry and phospho-specific antibodies, we demonstrated novel phosphorylation on S2159 and T2164 within the mTOR kinase domain. Mutational analysis of these phosphorylation sites indicates that dual S2159/T2164 phosphorylation cooperatively promotes mTORC1 signaling to S6K1 and 4EBP1. Mechanistically, S2159/T2164 phosphorylation modulates the mTOR-raptor and raptor-PRAS40 interactions and augments mTORC1-associated mTOR S2481 autophosphorylation.

This interaction relieves S6K1 auto-inhibition and facilitates its hydrophobic motif (HM) phosphorylation and activation as a consequence. These observations underscore a possible involvement of mTORC1 independent kinase in mediating HM phosphorylation. Here, we report mTORC2 as an in-vivo/physiological HM kinase of S6K1. We show that rapamycin-resistant S6K1 truncation mutant \u2206NH\u2206CT continues to display HM phosphorylation with selective sensitivity toward Torin-1. We also show that HM phosphorylation of wildtype S6K1and \u2206NH\u2206CT depends on the presence of mTORC2 regulatory subunit-rictor. Furthermore, truncation mutagenesis and molecular docking analysis reveal the involvement of a conserved 19 amino acid stretch of S6K1 in mediating interaction with rictor. We finally show that deletion of the 19 amino acid region from wildtype S6K1 results in loss of interaction with rictor, with a resultant loss of HM phosphorylation regardless of the presence of functional TOS motif.

We specifically focus on how growth factors, amino acids, G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), phosphorylation, and small GTPases regulate mTORC1 activity and signaling.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29337437": "Mechanistic (or mammalian) target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a kinase that regulates almost all functions related to cell growth and metabolism in response to extra- and intracellular stimuli, such as availability of nutrients, the presence of growth factors, or the energy status of the cell. As part of two distinct protein complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2, the kinase has been shown to influence cell growth and proliferation by controlling ribosome biogenesis, mRNA translation, carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, protein degradation, autophagy as well as microtubule and actin dynamics. In addition to these well-characterized functions, mTOR can also influence gene transcription. While most studies focused on investigating how canonical mTOR signaling regulates the activity of transcription factors outside the nucleus, recent findings point to a more direct role for mTOR as a transcription factor operating on chromatin in the nucleus. In particular, recent genome-wide identification of mTOR targets on chromatin reveals that its activities in the nucleus and cytoplasm are functionally and biologically linked, thus uncovering a novel paradigm in mTOR function.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32122730": "The mechanistic (or mammalian) Target of Rapamycin Complex 1 (mTORC1) is a central regulator of cell growth and metabolism.

The discovery that amino acids activate mTORC1 by promoting its translocation to the lysosome was a fundamental advance in the understanding of mTORC1 signalling. It has since become clear that the lysosome-cytoplasm shuttling of mTORC1 represents just one layer of spatial control of this signalling pathway. This review will focus on exploring the subcellular localisation of mTORC1 and its regulators to multiple sites within the cell. We will discuss how these spatially distinct regions such as endoplasmic reticulum, plasma membrane and the endosomal pathway co-operate to transduce nutrient availability to mTORC1, allowing for tight control of cell growth.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35580586": "The target of rapamycin (TOR), discovered 30 years ago, is a highly conserved serine/threonine protein kinase that plays a central role in regulating cell growth and metabolism.

It is now evident that mTORC1 promotes cell growth primarily through the activation of key anabolic processes. Through a diverse set of downstream targets, mTORC1 promotes the biosynthesis of macromolecules, including proteins, lipids, and nucleotides to build the biomass underlying cell, tissue, and organismal growth. Here, we focus on the metabolic functions of mTORC1 as they relate to the control of cell growth.

Our prior work demonstrated that an alkaline intracellular pH (pHi) increases mTORC2 activity and cell survival in complete media in part by activating AMP-activated protein kinase, a kinase best known to sense energetic stress. It is important to note that an alkaline pHi represents an underappreciated hallmark of cancer cells that promotes their oncogenic behaviors. In addition, mechanisms that control mTORC1 and mTORC2 signaling and function remain incompletely defined, particularly in response to stress conditions. Here, we demonstrate that an alkaline pHi increases phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) activity to promote mTORC1 and mTORC2 signaling in the absence of serum growth factors. Alkaline pHi increases mTORC1 activity through PI3K-Akt signaling, which mediates inhibitory phosphorylation of the upstream proteins tuberous sclerosis complex 2 and proline-rich Akt substrate of 40 kDa and dissociates tuberous sclerosis complex from lysosomal membranes, thus enabling Rheb-mediated activation of mTORC1. Thus, alkaline pHi mimics growth factor-PI3K signaling. Functionally, we also demonstrate that an alkaline pHi increases cap-dependent protein synthesis through inhibitory phosphorylation of eIF4E binding protein 1 and suppresses apoptosis in a PI3K- and mTOR-dependent manner. We speculate that an alkaline pHi promotes a low basal level of cell metabolism (e.g., protein synthesis) that enables cancer cells within growing tumors to proliferate and survive despite limiting growth factors and nutrients, in part through elevated PI3K-mTORC1 and/or PI3K-mTORC2 signaling.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23863160": "In order for cells to divide in a proficient manner, they must first double their biomass, which is considered to be the main rate-limiting phase of cell proliferation.

Here, we characterize the N-terminal kinase-like protein SCYL1 as a Golgi-localized target through which mTORC1 controls organelle distribution and extracellular vesicle secretion in breast cancer cells. Under growth conditions, SCYL1 is phosphorylated by mTORC1 on Ser754, supporting Golgi localization. Upon mTORC1 inhibition, Ser754 dephosphorylation leads to SCYL1 displacement to endosomes. Peripheral, dephosphorylated SCYL1 causes Golgi enlargement, redistribution of early and late endosomes and increased extracellular vesicle release. Thus, the mTORC1-controlled phosphorylation status of SCYL1 is an important determinant regulating subcellular distribution and function of endolysosomal compartments.

However, the mechanism by which cAMP and cGMP regulate mTOR activity is not completely understood. In this review, we will summarize the earlier work establishing the ability of cAMP to dampen mTORC1 activation in response to insulin and growth factors and then discuss our recent findings demonstrating the regulation of mTOR signaling by the PKA- and PKG-dependent signaling pathways. This signaling framework represents a new non-canonical regulation of mTOR activity that is independent of AKT and could be a novel mechanism underpinning the action of a variety of G protein-coupled receptors that are linked to the mTOR signaling network.

We also examined the effects of two mTOR inhibitors, Torin 1 and rapamycin, on TPA-stimulated THP-1 cells. Although mTORC1 activation was observed upon TPA stimulation, mTOR inhibitors did not affect TPA-induced morphological changes or expression of the general macrophage marker, CD11b. In contrast, phagocytosis and fluid endocytosis were significantly impaired by the mTOR inhibitors. Endocytosis suppression was observed when mTOR inhibitors were added during differentiation, but not before or after differentiation, suggesting that endocytosis suppression altered the direction of differentiation.

An in vitro mTORC1 kinase assay approach was used to probe the role of the mTORC1 component Raptor and revealed that certain Raptor mutations disrupt binding to eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) and prevent its subsequent phosphorylation by mTOR. Interestingly, we show that a point mutation in the highly conserved Raptor RNC domain still allows binding to mTOR but prevents Raptor association and mTOR-dependent phosphorylation of 4E-BP1, indicating that this Raptor domain facilitates substrate recognition by mTORC1. This Raptor RNC domain mutant also dominantly inhibits mTORC1 signalling to 4E-BP1, S6K1 and HIF1alpha in vivo. We further characterise the functions of the mTORC1 signalling (TOS) and RAIP motifs of 4E-BP1, which are involved in substrate recognition by Raptor and phosphorylation by mTORC1. We show that an mTOR mutant, L1460P, responds to insulin even in nutrient-deprived conditions and is resistant to inhibition by inactive RagB-RagC heterodimers that mimic nutrient withdrawal suggesting that this region of mTOR is involved in sensing the permissive amino acid input. We found that FKBP38 inhibits mTOR(L1460P), while the mTOR(E2419K) kinase domain mutant was resistant to FKBP38 inhibition.

Inhibition of MTORC1 strongly induces autophagy by regulating the activity of the ULK protein kinase complex that is required for the formation of autophagosomes. However, the participation of MTORC1 in the expression of autophagy genes has not been characterized. Here we show that MTORC1 regulates nuclear localization and activity of the transcription factor EB (TFEB), a member of the bHLH leucine-zipper family of transcription factors that drives expression of autophagy and lysosomal genes. Under normal nutrient conditions, TFEB is phosphorylated in Ser211 in an MTORC1-dependent manner. This phosphorylation promotes association of TFEB with members of the YWHA (14-3-3) family of proteins and retention of the transcription factor in the cytosol. Pharmacological or genetic inhibition of MTORC1 causes dissociation of the TFEB/YWHA complex and rapid transport of TFEB to the nucleus where it increases transcription of multiple genes implicated in autophagy and lysosomal function.

Based on the similarity between the cellular responses caused by rapamycin treatment and by nutrient starvation, it has been widely accepted that modulation in the mTORC1 activity in response to nutrient status directs these cellular responses, although direct evidence has been scarce. Here we report isolation of hyperactive mutants of mTOR. The isolated mTOR mutants exhibited enhanced kinase activity in vitro and rendered cells refractory to the dephosphorylation of the mTORC1 substrates upon amino acid starvation. Cells expressing the hyperactive mTOR mutant displayed larger cell size in a normal growing condition and were resistant to cell size reduction and autophagy induction in an amino acid-starved condition. These results indicate that the activity of mTORC1 actually directs these cellular processes in response to nutrient status and confirm the biological functions of mTORC1, which had been proposed solely from loss-of-function analyses using rapamycin and (molecular)genetic techniques.

Here we show that the FoxO3a transcription factor is coordinately regulated by mTORC1 and mTORC2, and plays a crucial role in controlling cell proliferation. To dissect mTOR signaling, mTORC1 was specifically inactivated by depleting p18, an essential anchor of mTORC1 on lysosomes. mTORC1 inactivation caused a marked retardation of cell proliferation, which was associated with upregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKIs). Although Akt was activated by mTORC1 inactivation, FoxO3a was upregulated via an epigenetic mechanism and hypophosphorylated at Ser314, which resulted in its nuclear accumulation. Consistently, mTORC1 inactivation induced downregulation of serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 1 (SGK1), the kinase responsible for Ser314 phosphorylation. Expression of FoxO3a mutated at Ser314 suppressed cell proliferation by inducing CDKI expression. SGK1 overexpression suppressed CDKI expression in p18-deficient cells, whereas SGK1 knockdown induced CDKI expression in wild-type cells, resulting in the suppression of cell proliferation.

These signaling functions are distributed between at least two distinct mTOR protein complexes: mTORC1 and mTORC2. mTORC1 is sensitive to the selective inhibitor rapamycin and activated by growth factor stimulation via the canonical phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-->Akt-->mTOR pathway. Activated mTORC1 kinase up-regulates protein synthesis by phosphorylating key regulators of mRNA translation. By contrast, mTORC2 is resistant to rapamycin.

The central role of mTOR in controlling key cellular growth and survival pathways has sparked interest in discovering mTOR inhibitors that bind to the ATP site and therefore target both mTORC2 and mTORC1. We investigated mTOR signaling in cells and animals with two novel and specific mTOR kinase domain inhibitors (TORKinibs). Unlike rapamycin, these TORKinibs (PP242 and PP30) inhibit mTORC2, and we use them to show that pharmacological inhibition of mTOR blocks the phosphorylation of Akt at S473 and prevents its full activation. Furthermore, we show that TORKinibs inhibit proliferation of primary cells more completely than rapamycin. Surprisingly, we find that mTORC2 is not the basis for this enhanced activity, and we show that the TORKinib PP242 is a more effective mTORC1 inhibitor than rapamycin. Importantly, at the molecular level, PP242 inhibits cap-dependent translation under conditions in which rapamycin has no effect. Our findings identify new functional features of mTORC1 that are resistant to rapamycin but are effectively targeted by TORKinibs.

Interestingly, mTORC1 negatively regulates Akt activation, but whether mTORC1 signaling directly targets mTORC2 remains unknown. Here we show that growth factors promote the phosphorylation of Rictor (rapamycin-insensitive companion of mTOR), an essential subunit of mTORC2. We found that Rictor phosphorylation requires mTORC1 activity and, more specifically, the p70 ribosomal S6 kinase 1 (S6K1). We identified several phosphorylation sites in Rictor and found that Thr1135 is directly phosphorylated by S6K1 in vitro and in vivo, in a rapamycin-sensitive manner. Phosphorylation of Rictor on Thr1135 did not affect mTORC2 assembly, kinase activity, or cellular localization. However, cells expressing a Rictor T1135A mutant were found to have increased mTORC2-dependent phosphorylation of Akt. In addition, phosphorylation of the Akt substrates FoxO1/3a and glycogen synthase kinase 3 alpha/beta (GSK3 alpha/beta) was found to be increased in these cells, indicating that S6K1-mediated phosphorylation of Rictor inhibits mTORC2 and Akt signaling.

In contrast, Atg5 deficiency did not have a significant effect on mTORC1 signaling and cell proliferation. The stimulatory effect of ULK1 knockdown on mTORC1 signaling occurred even in the absence of tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2), the negative regulator of mTORC1 signaling. In addition, ULK1 was found to bind raptor, induce its phosphorylation, and inhibit the kinase activity of mTORC1. These results demonstrate that ULK1 negatively regulates the kinase activity of mTORC1 and cell proliferation in a manner independent of Atg5 and TSC2. The\u00a0 inhibition of mTORC1 by ULK1 may be important to coordinately regulate cell growth and autophagy with optimized utilization of cellular energy.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23416465": "The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is a key regulator of cell growth and proliferation in response to various upstream signals. Hypoxia has been shown to exert a strong inhibitory effect on mTORC1 activity. Various mechanisms involving gene transcription have been proposed to mediate the effect of hypoxia on mTORC1 activity. Here we show that oxygen concentrations regulate mTORC1 activity in a highly dynamic manner. The rapid response of mTORC1 to changes in oxygen concentrations was not mediated by the HIF transcription factor or its transcriptional targets, REDD1 and BNIP3. Interestingly, we observed that the rapid response of mTORC1 activity to changes in oxygen concentrations is independent of transcription and new protein synthesis. This suggests a post-translational regulation mTORC1 activity in hypoxia and reoxygenation. We also provide evidence that hypoxia does not regulate mTORC1 via the TSC1/2 or Ragulator pathways but directly at the level of mTORC1.

Cellular activities, such as the regulation of metabolism, growth, and aging, are mediated by a network of nutrients and nutrient-sensing pathways. Among the nutrient-sensing pathways, the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) acts as the central regulator of cellular functions, which include autophagy. Autophagy plays a significant role in the removal of protein aggregates and damaged or excess organelles, including mitochondria, to maintain intracellular homeostasis, which is involved in lifespan extension and cardiometabolic health. Moreover, dietary methionine restriction may have a beneficial effect on lifespan extension and metabolic health. In contrast, methionine may activate mTORC1 and suppress autophagy. As the mechanism of methionine sensing on mTORC1, SAMTOR was identified as a sensor of S-adenosyl methionine (SAM), a metabolite of methionine, in the cytoplasm. Conversely, methionine may activate the mTORC1 signaling pathway through the activation of phosphatase 2A (PP2A) because of increased methylation in response to intracellular SAM levels.

This review provides an update on the most recent additions to the mTOR pathway with particular emphasis on mTORC1 signalling. mTORC1 signalling is classically known for its role in regulating cell growth and proliferation through modulation of protein synthesis. Recent research has identified novel mTORC1 cell signalling mechanisms that modulate mitochondrial biogenesis, hypoxia signalling and cell cycle progression and uncovered novel mTORC1 targets; YY1, HIF and SGK1. It is unsurprising that regulation of mTORC1 is multifaceted with many positive and negative signalling inputs. We discuss the recent advances that have been made to determine the upstream mechanisms that control mTORC1 through hypoxia, energy sensing and nutrient signalling.

However, how mTORC1 senses glucose availability to regulate various downstream signalling pathways remains largely elusive. Here we report that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-mediated phosphorylation of WDR24, a core component of the GATOR2 complex, has a role in the glucose-sensing capability of mTORC1. Mechanistically, glucose deprivation activates AMPK, which directly phosphorylates WDR24 on S155, subsequently disrupting the integrity of the GATOR2 complex to suppress mTORC1 activation. Phosphomimetic Wdr24S155D knock-in mice exhibit early embryonic lethality and reduced mTORC1 activity. On the other hand, compared to wild-type littermates, phospho-deficient Wdr24S155A knock-in mice are more resistant to fasting and display elevated mTORC1 activity. Our findings reveal that AMPK-mediated phosphorylation of WDR24 modulates glucose-induced mTORC1 activation, thereby providing a rationale for targeting AMPK-WDR24 signalling to fine-tune mTORC1 activation as a potential therapeutic means to combat human diseases with aberrant activation of mTORC1 signalling including cancer.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25263562": "The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) kinase is a major regulator of cell growth that responds to numerous environmental cues.

GATOR2 is a complex of unknown function that positively regulates mTORC1 signaling by acting upstream of or in parallel to GATOR1, which is a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for RagA or RagB and an inhibitor of the amino-acid-sensing pathway. Here, we find that the Sestrins, a family of poorly understood growth regulators (Sestrin1-Sestrin3), interact with GATOR2 in an amino-acid-sensitive fashion. Sestrin2-mediated inhibition of mTORC1 signaling requires GATOR1 and the Rag GTPases, and the Sestrins regulate the localization of mTORC1 in response to amino acids.

However, a direct role of the mTORC1-S6K1 signaling pathway in DNA repair and the mechanism by which this signaling pathway regulates DNA repair is unknown. In this study, we discovered a novel role for S6K1 in regulating DNA repair through the coordinated regulation of the cell cycle, homologous recombination (HR) DNA repair (HRR) and mismatch DNA repair (MMR) mechanisms. Here, we show that S6K1 orchestrates DNA repair by phosphorylation of Cdk1 at serine 39, causing G2/M cell cycle arrest enabling homologous recombination and by phosphorylation of MSH6 at serine 309, enhancing MMR. Moreover, breast cancer cells harboring RPS6KB1 gene amplification show increased resistance to several DNA damaging agents and S6K1 expression is associated with poor survival of breast cancer patients treated with chemotherapy.

In Drosophila S2 cells and mammalian cells, knockdown of MARK family member increased mTORC1 activity, whereas overexpression of MARK4 in mammalian cells significantly inhibited mTORC1 activity. Interestingly, MARK4 selectively inhibits mTORC1 activation by Rag GTPases, which are involved in amino acid signaling, but does not inhibit the effect of Rheb, which directly binds to and activates mTORC1. In addition, we found that MARK4 phosphorylates Raptor, a key component of mTORC1, and this phosphorylation may interfere with Raptor-Rag interaction.

The nutrient-sensitive mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) controls cell growth and cell size by phosphorylation of the regulators of protein synthesis S6K1 and 4EBP1, whereas its second complex, mTORC2, regulates cell proliferation by functioning as the regulatory kinase of Akt and other members of the AGC kinase family. The regulation of mTORC2 remains poorly characterized. Our study shows that the cellular ATP balance controls a basal kinase activity of mTORC2 that maintains the integrity of mTORC2 and phosphorylation of Akt on the turn motif Thr-450 site. We found that mTOR stabilizes SIN1 by phosphorylation of its hydrophobic and conserved Ser-260 site to maintain the integrity of mTORC2. The optimal kinase activity of mTORC2 requires a concentration of ATP above 1.2 mM and makes this kinase complex highly sensitive to ATP depletion. We found that not amino acid but glucose deprivation of cells or acute ATP depletion prevented the mTOR-dependent phosphorylation of SIN1 on Ser-260 and Akt on Thr-450. In a low glucose medium, the cells carrying a substitution of SIN1 with its phosphomimetic mutant show an increased rate of cell proliferation related to a higher abundance of mTORC2 and phosphorylation of Akt.

To evaluate the pharmacological properties of insulin icodec in individuals with type 2 diabetes, a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled, multiple-dose, dose escalation trial was conducted.\nRESULTS: The long half-life of insulin icodec was achieved by introducing modifications to the insulin molecule aiming to obtain a safe, albumin-bound circulating depot of insulin icodec, providing protracted insulin action and clearance. Addition of a C20 fatty diacid-containing side chain imparts strong, reversible albumin binding, while three amino acid substitutions (A14E, B16H and B25H) provide molecular stability and contribute to attenuating insulin receptor (IR) binding and clearance, further prolonging the half-life.

Primary end point was percent time in range (TIR; 3.9-10.0 mmol/L [70-180 mg/dL]) during weeks 15 and 16, measured using continuous glucose monitoring. Key secondary end points included HbA<sub>1c</sub>, adverse events (AEs), and hypoglycemia.\nRESULTS: Estimated mean TIR during weeks 15 and 16 was 72.9% (icodec LD; n = 54), 66.0% (icodec NLD; n = 50), and 65.0% (IGlar U100; n = 50), with a statistically significant difference favoring icodec LD versus IGlar U100 (7.9%-points [95% CI 1.8-13.9]).

The continuous cross-talk between glioma stem cells (GSCs) and the tumor microenvironment (TME) contributes to disease progression, which renders research in this field difficult and challenging. The main aim of the review was to assess the different possible mechanisms that could explain resistance to treatment promoted by TME and GSCs in glioblastoma, including the role of M2 macrophages, micro RNAs (miRNAs), and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) from exosomes from the TME.

Emerging evidence suggests that GBM cells appear to reprogram their the TME, and hijack microenvironmental elements to facilitate rapid proliferation, invasion, migration, and survival thus generating treatment resistance.

GSCs occur in tumor niches where both stemness status and angiogenesis are conditioned by the microenvironment. In both perivascular and perinecrotic niches, hypoxia plays a fundamental role. Fifteen glioblastomas have been studied by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence for stemness and differentiation antigens. It has been found that circumscribed necroses develop inside hyperproliferating areas that are characterized by high expression of stemness antigens. Necrosis developed inside them because of the imbalance between the proliferation of tumor cells and endothelial cells; it reduces the number of GSCs to a thin ring around the former hyperproliferating area. The perinecrotic GSCs are nothing else that the survivors remnants of those populating hyperproliferating areas.

CCL5 and CCR5 gene expression were significantly higher in a cohort of 38 glioblastoma samples, compared to low-grade glioma and non-cancerous tissues. The in vitro invasion of patients-derived primary glioblastoma cells and glioblastoma stem cells was dependent on CCL5-induced CCR5 signaling and is strongly inhibited by the small molecule CCR5 antagonist maraviroc.

In support of this model, we detected CCL5 and CCR5 in MSC monocultures and glioblastoma-associated MSC in tissue sections. We also found CCR5 expressing macrophages were in close proximity to glioblastoma cells. In conclusion, autocrine and paracrine cross-talk in glioblastoma and, in particular, glioblastoma stem cells with its stromal microenvironment, involves CCR5 and CCL5, contributing to glioblastoma invasion, suggesting the CCL5/CCR5 axis as a potential therapeutic target that can be targeted with repositioned drug maraviroc.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36338705": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is an extremely aggressive and incurable primary brain tumor with a 10-year survival of just 0.71%.

These models try to account for the presence of GSCs and more differentiated cells, the influence of different microenvironments enclosed within the mass, heterotypic interactions between GBM and stromal cells and genetic aberrations. Understanding the mechanism of action of the microenvironmental signals and the interplay between different cell types within the tumor mass, open new questions on how GSCs modulate GBM aggressiveness and response to therapy. The definition of these tumor features will allow to setup innovative multimodal therapies able to target GBM cells at multiple levels. Here, we will discuss the major advances in the study of GSC role in GBM and the therapeutic implications resulting from them, thus reporting the latest strategies applied to counteract and overcome GBM intrinsic resistance to therapy for a better management of patients.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21446047": "High-grade brain tumors are heterogeneous with respect to the composition of bona fide tumors cells and with respect to a range of intermingling parenchymal cells. Glioblastomas harbor multiple cell types, some with increased tumorigenicity and stem cell-like capacity. The stem-like cells may be the cells of origin for tumor relapse. However, the tumor-associated parenchymal cells-such as vascular cells, microglia, peripheral immune cells, and neural precursor cells-also play a vital role in controlling the course of pathology. In this review, we describe the multiple interactions of bulk glioma cells and glioma stem cells with parenchymal cell populations and highlight the pathological impact and signaling pathways known for these types of cell-cell communication. The tumor-vasculature not only nourishes glioblastomas, but also provides a specialized niche for these stem-like cells. In addition, microglial cells, which can contribute up to 30% of a brain tumor mass, play a role in glioblastoma cell invasion. Moreover, non-neoplastic astrocytes can be converted into a reactive phenotype by the glioma microenvironment and can then secrete a number of factors which influences tumor biology. The young brain may have the capacity to inhibit gliomagenesis by the endogenous neural stem and progenitor cells, which secrete tumor suppressive factors. The factors, pathways, and interactions described in this review provide a new prospective on the cell biology of primary brain tumors, which may ultimately generate new treatment modalities. However, our picture of the multiple interactions between parenchymal and tumor cells is still incomplete. \u00a9 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24904289": "Chemokines are crucial autocrine and paracrine players in tumor development. In particular, CXCL12, through its receptors CXCR4 and CXCR7, affects tumor progression by controlling cancer cell survival, proliferation and migration, and, indirectly, via angiogenesis or recruiting immune cells. Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most prevalent primary malignant brain tumor in adults and despite current multimodal therapies it remains almost incurable. The aggressive and recurrent phenotype of GBM is ascribed to high growth rate, invasiveness to normal brain, marked angiogenesis, ability to escape the immune system and resistance to standard of care therapies. Tumor molecular and cellular heterogeneity severely hinders GBM therapeutic improvement. In particular, a subpopulation of chemo- and radio-therapy resistant tumorigenic cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) is believed to be the main responsible for tumor cell dissemination to the brain. GBM cells display heterogeneous expression levels of CXCR4 and CXCR7 that are overexpressed in CSCs, representing a molecular correlate for the invasive potential of GBM. The microenvironment contribution in GBM development is increasingly emphasized. An interplay exists between CSCs, differentiated GBM cells, and the microenvironment, mainly through secreted chemokines (e.g., CXCL12) causing recruitment of fibroblasts, endothelial, mesenchymal and inflammatory cells to the tumor, via specific receptors such as CXCR4. This review covers recent developments on the role of CXCL12/CXCR4-CXCR7 networks in GBM progression and the potential translational impact of their targeting. The biological and molecular understanding of the heterogeneous GBM cell behavior, phenotype and signaling is still limited. Progress in the identification of chemokine-dependent mechanisms that affect GBM cell survival, trafficking and chemo-attractive functions, opens new perspectives for development of more specific therapeutic approaches that include chemokine-based drugs.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31147872": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive and lethal disease that often results in a poor prognosis. Unlike most solid tumors, GBM is characterized by diffuse infiltrating margins, extensive angiogenesis, hypoxia, necrosis, and clonal heterogeneity. Recurrent disease is an unavoidable consequence for many patients as standard treatment options such as surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy have proven to be insufficient in causing long-term survival benefits. Systemic delivery of promising drugs is hindered due to the blood-brain barrier and non-uniform perfusion within GBM tissue. In recent years, many investigations have highlighted the role of GBM stem cells (GSCs) and their microenvironment in the initiation and maintenance of tumor tissue. Preclinical and early clinical studies to target GSCs and microenvironmental components are currently underway. Of these strategies, immunotherapy using checkpoint inhibitors and redirected cytotoxic T cells have shown promising results in early investigations. But, GBM microenvironment is heterogenous and recent investigations have shown cell populations within this microenvironment to be plastic. These studies underline the importance of identifying the role of and targeting multiple cell populations within the GBM microenvironment which could have a synergistic effect when combined with novel therapies. Pericytes are multipotent perivascular cells that play a vital role within the GBM microenvironment by assisting in tumor initiation, survival, and progression. Due to their role in regulating the blood-brain barrier permeability, promoting angiogenesis, tumor growth, clearing extracellular matrix for infiltrating GBM cells and in helping GBM cells evade immune surveillance, pericytes could be ideal therapeutic targets for stymieing or exploiting their role within the GBM microenvironment. This chapter will introduce hallmarks of GBM and elaborate on the contributions of pericytes to these hallmarks by examining recent findings. In addition, the chapter also highlights the therapeutic value of targeting pericytes, while discussing conventional and novel GBM therapies and obstacles to their efficacy.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35920986": "With the application of high throughput sequencing technologies at single-cell resolution, studies of the tumor microenvironment in glioblastoma, one of the most aggressive and invasive of all cancers, have revealed immense cellular and tissue heterogeneity. A unique extracellular scaffold system adapts to and supports progressive infiltration and migration of tumor cells, which is characterized by altered composition, effector delivery, and mechanical properties. The spatiotemporal interactions between malignant and immune cells generate an immunosuppressive microenvironment, contributing to the failure of effective anti-tumor immune attack. Among the heterogeneous tumor cell subpopulations of glioblastoma, glioma stem cells (GSCs), which exhibit tumorigenic properties and strong invasive capacity, are critical for tumor growth and are believed to contribute to therapeutic resistance and tumor recurrence. Here we discuss the role of extracellular matrix and immune cell populations, major components of the tumor ecosystem in glioblastoma, as well as signaling pathways that regulate GSC maintenance and invasion. We also highlight emerging advances in therapeutic targeting of these components.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35228161": "Glioblastomas (GBMs) are the most common primary brain tumors with poor prognosis due to their aggressive growth accompanied by invasive behavior and therapy-resistance. These features promote a high rate of recurrence; therefore, they are largely incurable. One major cause of the incurability is brought about by the intimate relationship of GBM cells with the microenvironment, which supports the tumor growth in various ways by providing a permissive neighborhood. In the tumor microenvironment are glioma stem cells (GSC); endothelial cells (EC) and hypoxic regions; immune cells and immune modulatory cues; astrocytes; neural stem/precursor cells (NPC) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). Each cell type contributes to GBM pathology in unique ways; therefore, it is necessary to understand such interactions between GBM cells and the stromal cells in order to establish a through understanding of the GBM pathology. By explaining the contribution of each stromal entity to GBM pathology we aim to draw an interaction map for GBMs and promote awareness of the complexity of the GBM microenvironment.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34687436": "In patients with glioblastoma, the average survival time with current treatments is short, mainly due to recurrences and resistance to therapy. This insufficient treatment success is, in large parts, due to the tremendous molecular heterogeneity of gliomas, which affects the overall prognosis and response to therapies and plays a vital role in gliomas' grading. In addition, the tumor microenvironment is a major player for glioma development and resistance to therapy. Active communication between glioma cells and local or neighboring healthy cells and the immune environment promotes the cancerogenic processes and contributes to establishing glioma stem cells, which drives therapy resistance. Besides genetic alterations in the primary tumor, tumor-released factors, cytokines, proteins, extracellular vesicles, and environmental influences like hypoxia provide tumor cells the ability to evade host tumor surveillance machinery and promote disease progression. Moreover, there is increasing evidence that these players affect the molecular biological properties of gliomas and enable inter-cell communication that supports pro-cancerogenic cell properties. Identifying and characterizing these complex mechanisms are inevitably necessary to adapt therapeutic strategies and to develop novel measures. Here we provide an update about these junctions where constant traffic of biomolecules adds complexity in the management of glioblastoma.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28630875": "Glioblastoma is the most aggressive cancer of the brain. The dismal prognosis is largely attributed to the heterogeneous nature of the tumor, which in addition to intrinsic molecular and genetic changes is also influenced by the microenvironmental niche in which the glioma cells reside. The cancer stem cells (CSCs) hypothesis suggests that all cancers arise from CSCs that possess the ability to self-renew and initiate tumor formation. CSCs reside in specialized niches where interaction with the microenvironment regulates their stem cell behavior. The reciprocal interaction between glioma stem cells (GSCs) and cells from the microenvironment, such as endothelial cells, immune cells, and other parenchymal cells, may also promote angiogenesis, invasion, proliferation, and stemness of the GSCs and be likely to have an underappreciated role in their responsiveness to therapy. This crosstalk may also promote molecular transition of GSCs. Hence the inherent plasticity of GSCs can be seen as an adaptive response, changing according to the signaling cue from the niche. Given the association of GSCs with tumor recurrence and treatment sensitivity, understanding this bidirectional crosstalk between GSCs and its niche may provide a framework to identify more effective therapeutic targets and improve treatment outcome.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37218976": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is a common and highly malignant primary tumor of the central nervous system in adults. Ever more recent papers are focusing on understanding the role of the tumor microenvironment (TME) in affecting tumorigenesis and the subsequent prognosis. We assessed the impact of macrophages in the TME on the prognosis in patients with recurrent GBM. A PubMed, MEDLINE and Scopus review was conducted to identify all studies dealing with macrophages in the GBM microenvironment from January 2016 to December 2022. Glioma-associated macrophages (GAMs) act critically in enhancing tumor progression and can alter drug resistance, promoting resistance to radiotherapy and establishing an immunosuppressive environment. M1 macrophages are characterized by increased secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1\u00df, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), IL-27, matrix metalloproteinase (MMPs), CCL2, and VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor), IGF1, that can lead to the destruction of the tissue. In contrast, M2 is supposed to participate in immunosuppression and tumor progression, which is formed after being exposed to the macrophage M-CSF, IL-10, IL-35 and the transforming growth factor-\u00df (TGF-\u03b2). Because there is currently no standard of care in recurrent GBM, novel identified targeted therapies based on the complex signaling and interactions between the glioma stem cells (GSCs) and the TME, especially resident microglia and bone-marrow-derived macrophages, may be helpful in improving the overall survival of these patients in the near future.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37108208": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and malignant primary brain cancer in adults. Without treatment the mean patient survival is approximately 6 months, which can be extended to 15 months with the use of multimodal therapies. The low effectiveness of GBM therapies is mainly due to the tumor infiltration into the healthy brain tissue, which depends on GBM cells' interaction with the tumor microenvironment (TME). The interaction of GBM cells with the TME involves cellular components such as stem-like cells, glia, endothelial cells, and non-cellular components such as the extracellular matrix, enhanced hypoxia, and soluble factors such as adenosine, which promote GBM's invasiveness. However, here we highlight the role of 3D patient-derived glioblastoma organoids cultures as a new platform for study of the modeling of TME and invasiveness.

The dynamic and heterogeneous tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a fundamental role in tumor development, progression, invasiveness, and therapy resistance. There is increasing evidence showing the critical role of the RAS in the TME influencing CSCs via its upstream and downstream pathways. Drugs that alter the hallmarks of cancer by modulating the RAS present a potential new therapeutic alternative or adjunct to conventional treatment of GB. Cerebral and GB organoids may offer a cost-effective method for evaluating the efficacy of RAS-modulating drugs on GB.

CSCs are known to organize a self-advantageous microenvironment (niche) for their maintenance and expansion. Therefore, understanding how the microenvironment is reconstructed by the remaining CSCs after conventional treatments and how it eventually causes recurrence should be essential to inhibit cancer recurrence. However, the number of studies focusing on recurrence is limited, particularly those related to tumor immune microenvironment, while numerous data have been obtained from primary resected samples. Here, we summarize recent investigations on the immune microenvironment from the viewpoint of recurrent GBM (rGBM). Based on the recurrence-associated immune cell composition reported so far, we will discuss how CSCs manipulate host immunity and create the special microenvironment for themselves to regrow.

These cells also are at the apex of the cellular hierarchy and cause tumor initiation and expansion after chemo-radiation. These traits make them an attractive target for therapeutic development. Because GSCs are dependent on the brain microenvironment for their growth, and because non-tumorigenic cell types in the microenvironment can influence GSC phenotypes and treatment response, a better understanding of these cell types is needed.

Nanoparticles can be easily modified by different methods to facilitate delivery efficiency of chemotherapeutics, to enhance the accumulation within the tumors, and to promote the capacity for targeting the GSCs.

BBB-crossing ApoB@AuNPs were selectively taken up in microvascular endothelial cells proliferation and pericyte invasion, which are therapeutic targets in the glioma TME. Proton sensitization treated the TME and bulk tumor volume with enhanced therapeutic efficacy by 67-75% compared to that with protons alone.

Here we evaluated the response of tumor microvascular endothelial cells (tMVECs) to radio- and chemotherapy, and analyzed how this affects their interaction with CSCs. Our data demonstrate that tMVECs exhibit extreme resistance to both therapies, with the main response to irradiation being senescence. Importantly, senescent tMVECs can be detected in human GBM samples as well as in mice upon irradiation. Even though permanently arrested, they are still viable and able to support CSC growth with the same efficacy as non-senescent tMVECs.

Here we review recently identified mechanisms of maintenance and expansion of glioma CSCs (GSCs) leading to glioma progression and recurrence, with particular emphasis on the reports made by studies with a unique approach using polymer microarrays screening and with a unique viewpoint of necrotic particles. The polymer-based approach identified two groups of niche components, extracellular matrices (ECMs) and iron, and uncovered that co-expression of ECM-, iron-, and macrophage-related genes is predictive of glioma patients' outcome. The study in view of a unique fraction of GSC-derived necrotic particles proposed that such particles develop GSC-supportive tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs).

Recent data have attributed GBM invasion to the glioma stem-like cell (GSC) subpopulation. GSCs are slowly dividing, highly invasive, therapy resistant, and are considered to give rise to tumor recurrence. GSCs are localized in a heterogeneous cellular niche, and cross talk between stromal cells and GSCs cultivates a fertile environment that promotes GSC invasion. Pro-migratory soluble factors from endothelial cells, astrocytes, macrophages, microglia, and non-stem-like tumor cells can stimulate peritumoral invasion of GSCs.

In fact, \"microvascular hyperplasia\" is a hallmark of GBM. An altered vascular network determines irregular blood flow, so that tumor cells spread rapidly beyond the diffusion distance of oxygen in the tissue, with the consequent formation of hypoxic or anoxic areas, where the bulk of glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) reside. The response to this event is the induction of angiogenesis, a process mediated by hypoxia inducible factors. However, this new capillary network is not efficient in maintaining a proper oxygen supply to the tumor mass, thereby causing an oxygen gradient within the neoplastic zone. This microenvironment helps GSCs to remain in a \"quiescent\" state preserving their potential to proliferate and differentiate, thus protecting them by the effects of chemo- and radiotherapy. Recent evidences suggest that responses of glioblastoma to standard therapies are determined by the microenvironment of the niche, where the GSCs reside, allowing a variety of mechanisms that contribute to the chemo- and radioresistance, by preserving GSCs.

We recently reported that physiologic oxygen levels differentially induce hypoxia inducible factor-2alpha (HIF2alpha) levels in cancer stem cells. HIF1alpha functioned in proliferation and survival of all cancer cells but also was activated in normal neural progenitors suggesting a potentially restricted therapeutic index while HIF2alpha was essential in only in cancer stem cells and was not expressed by normal neural progenitors demonstrating HIF2alpha is a cancer stem cell specific target. We now extend these studies to examine the role of hypoxia in regulating tumor cell plasticity. We find that hypoxia promotes the self-renewal capability of the stem and non-stem population as well as promoting a more stem-like phenotype in the non-stem population with increased neurosphere formation as well as upregulation of important stem cell factors, such as OCT4, NANOG and c-MYC. The importance of HIF2alpha was further supported as forced expression of non-degradable HIF2alpha induced a cancer stem cell marker and augmented the tumorigenic potential of the non-stem population. This novel finding may indicate a specific role of HIF2alpha in promoting glioma tumorigenesis. The unexpected plasticity of the non-stem glioma population and the stem-like phenotype emphasizes the importance of developing therapeutic strategies targeting the microenvironmental influence on the tumor in addition to cancer stem cells.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37644520": "BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common cancers all over the world, and dysbiosis in the gut microbiota may play a role in colorectal carcinogenesis. Bacteroides fragilis can lead to tumorigenesis by changing signaling pathways, including the WNT/\u03b2-catenin pathway. Therefore, in the present study, we investigated the correlation between the enterotoxigenic B. fragilis amount and the expression of signaling pathway genes involved in CRC.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: B. fragilis was determined in 30 tumors and adjacent healthy tissues by the qPCR method. Next, the relationship between enterotoxigenic B. fragilis and the expression of signaling pathway genes, including CCND1, TP53, BCL2, BAX, WNT, TCF, AXIN, APC, and CTNNB1 was investigated. Additionally, possible correlations between clinicopathological features of the tumor samples and the abundance of B. fragilis were analyzed.\nRESULTS: The results showed that B. fragilis was detected in 100% of tumor samples and 86% of healthy tissues. Additionally, enterotoxigenic B. fragilis colonized 47% of all samples, and bft-1 toxin was the most frequently found isotype among the samples. The analysis showed that the high level of B. fragilis has a significant relationship with the high expression of AXIN, CTNNB1, and BCL2 genes. On the other hand, our results did not show any possible correlation between this bacterium and the clinicopathological features of the tumor sample.\nCONCLUSION: B. fragilis had a higher abundance in the tumor samples than in healthy tissues, and this bacterium may lead to CRC by making changes in cellular signaling pathways and genes. Therefore, to better understand the physiological effects of B. fragilis on the inflammatory response and CRC, future research should focus on dissecting the molecular mechanisms by which this bacterium regulates cellular signaling pathways.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25105360": "The human body comprises fewer host cells than bacterial cells, most of which are obligate anaerobes residing in the gut. The symbiont Bacteroides fragilis constitutes a relatively small proportion (up to 1%-2%) of cultured fecal bacteria, but colonizes most humans. There are 2 classes of B. fragilis distinguished by their ability to secrete a zinc-dependent metalloprotease toxin, B. fragilis toxin (BFT). Strains that do not secrete BFT are nontoxigenic B. fragilis (NTBF), and those that do are called enterotoxigenic B. fragilis (ETBF). ETBF can induce clinical pathology, including inflammatory diarrhea, although asymptomatic colonization may be common. Intestinal inflammation is mediated by BFT, as yet the only known virulence factor of ETBF. Recent experimental evidence demonstrating that ETBF-driven colitis promotes colon tumorigenesis has generated interest in the potential contribution of ETBF to human colon carcinogenesis.

Recent studies have reported that the development of IBD and CRC partly results from an imbalanced composition of intestinal microbiota and that intestinal inflammation in these diseases can be modulated by the microbiota. The human commensal Bacteroides fragilis is best exemplified playing a protective role against the development of experimental colitis in several animal disease models. In this study, we found that gut inflammation caused by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) treatment was inhibited by B. fragilis colonization in mice. Further, we reveal a protective role of B. fragilis treatment against colon tumorigenesis using an azoxymethane (AOM)/DSS-induced model of colitis-associated colon cancer in mice and demonstrate that the decreased tumorigenesis by B. fragilis administration is accompanied by inhibited expression of C-C chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) in the gut. We show direct evidence that the inhibition of tumor formation provided by B. fragilis in colitis-associated CRC animals was dependent on the production of polysaccharide A (PSA) from B. fragilis and that Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) signaling was responsible for the protective function of B. fragilisIMPORTANCE The incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) is rapidly growing worldwide, and there is therefore a greater emphasis on studies of the treatment or prevention of CRC pathogenesis. Recent studies suggested that consideration of the microbiota is unavoidable to understand inflammation and tumorigenesis in the gastrointestinal tract. We demonstrate, using a mouse model of colitis-associated CRC, that human commensal B. fragilis protects against colon tumorigenesis. The protective role against tumor formation provided by B. fragilis is associated with inhibition of expression of the chemokine receptor CCR5 in the colon. The molecular mechanism for protection against CRC provided by B. fragilis is dependent on polysaccharide A production and is mediated by TLR2 signaling.

The mucosal biopsies of involved sites were obtained from 68 patients with precancerous and cancerous lesions and 52 healthy controls (HC). The samples were cultured on Bacteroides Bile Esculin agar. Then, specific primers were designed to detect B. fragilis and bft gene using quantitative real-time PCR, and the possible links of ETBF with clinicopathological characteristics was evaluated.

Methods: Samples of jejunal tissue were collected from the site of tumours and from grossly normal adjacent tissue in 20 sheep, in different consignments, diagnosed with SIA based on gross examination of viscera following slaughter. Two jejunal samples were also collected from a control sheep in the same consignment that had no gross evidence of SIA. A PCR assay was used to detect the presence of the bft gene in the samples. Results: Of the sheep with SIA, the bft gene was amplified from one or both samples from 7/20 (35%) sheep, and in sheep that had no gross evidence of SIA the bft gene was amplified from at least one sample in 11/20 (55%) sheep (RR 0.61; 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.30-1.25; p\u2009=\u20090.34). Of 11 positive samples analysed, ETBF subtype bft-1 was detected in one, bft-2 was detected in 10, and none were bft-3. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance: There was a high prevalence of detection of the bft gene in both SIA-affected and non-affected sheep, but there was no apparent association between carriage of ETBF, evidenced by detection of the bft gene, and the presence of SIA.

We show that colonisation by E. faecalis and high levels of Fusobacterium is associated with a specific transcriptomic subtype of CRC that is characterised by CpG island methylation, microsatellite instability and a significant increase in inflammatory and DNA damage pathways. Analysis of the significant, bacterially-associated changes in host gene expression, both at the level of individual genes as well as pathways, revealed a transcriptional remodeling that provides a plausible mechanistic link between specific bacterial colonisation and colorectal cancer disease development and progression in this subtype; these included upregulation of REG3A, REG1A and REG1P in the case of high-level colonization by Fusobacterium, and CXCL10 and BMI1 in the case of colonisation by E. faecalis.

The enterotoxigenic B. fragilis (ETBF) forms biofilm and produce toxin and play a role in CRC, whereas the non-toxigenic B. fragilis (NTBF) does not produce toxin. The ETBF triggers the expression of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 that releases PGE2 for inducing inflammation and control cell proliferation. From chronic intestinal inflammation to cancer development, it involves signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT)3 activation. STAT3 activates by the interaction between epithelial cells and BFT. Thus, regulatory T-cell (Tregs) will activates and reduce interleukin (IL)-2 amount. As the level of IL-2 drops, T-helper (T<sub>h</sub>17) cells are generated leading to increase in IL-17 levels. IL-17 is implicated in early intestinal inflammation and promotes cancer cell survival and proliferation and consequently triggers IL-6 production that activate STAT3 pathway. Additionally, BFT degrades E-cadherin, hence alteration of signalling pathways can upregulate spermine oxidase leading to cell morphology and promote carcinogenesis and irreversible DNA damage. Patient with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) disease displays a high level of tumour load in the colon. This disease is caused by germline mutation of the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene that increases bacterial adherence to the mucosa layer.

Previous studies have reported that intestinal microbiota disturbance plays an important role in the process of CAC development in patients with UC, indicating that targeted intervention of intestinal microbiota and its metabolites may be a potential therapeutic strategy. Gut microbiota in the process of colorectal cancer development in UC patients was analyzed using the gutMEGA database and verified in fecal samples. The abundance of Bacteroides fragilis reduced significantly in the process of colitis associated cancer development. Broad-spectrum antibiotics (BSAB) intervene with the intestinal microbiota of mice and accelerate the process of colon cancer development. However, gavage transplantation with B. fragilis can effectively reverse the effects of BSAB. In the intestinal tract, B. fragilis promotes the secretion of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). Subsequently, SCFAs, especially butyrate, negatively regulate the inflammatory signaling pathway mediated by NLRP3 to inhibit the activation of macrophages and the secretion of proinflammatory mediators such as IL-18 and IL-1\u03b2, reducing the level of intestinal inflammation and restricting CAC development. In conclusion, colonization with B. fragilis has been shown to be effective in ameliorating intestinal epithelial damage caused by chronic inflammation and preventing the development of colonic tumors.

Enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis (ETBF) is a well-known tumor-inducing bacterium in the human gut; however, its tumorigenic effect remains to be explored. In the present study, we revealed the mechanism by which a lncRNA participates in gut bacteria-induced carcinogenesis: Bacteroides fragilis-associated lncRNA1 (BFAL1) in CRC tissues mediates ETBF carcinogenesis. BFAL1 was highly expressed in CRC tissues compared with that in adjacent normal tissues. In vitro, BFAL1 was upregulated in ETBF-treated CRC cells. Mechanistically, ETBF promoted tumor growth via BFAL1 by activating the Ras homolog, which is the MTORC1 binding/mammalian target of the rapamycin (RHEB/mTOR) pathway. Furthermore, BFAL1 regulated RHEB expression by competitively sponging microRNAs miR-155-5p and miR-200a-3p.

However, whether specific mutations induced by ETBF lead to colon tumor formation has not been investigated. To determine if ETBF-induced mutations impact the Apc gene, and other tumor suppressors or proto-oncogenes, we performed whole-exome sequencing and whole-genome sequencing on tumors isolated after ETBF and sham colonization of Apcmin/+ and Apcmin/+Msh2fl/flVC mice, as well as whole-genome sequencing of organoids cocultured with ETBF. Our results indicate that ETBF-induced tumor formation results from loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of Apc, unless the mismatch repair system is disrupted, in which case, tumor formation results from new acquisition of protein-truncating mutations in Apc. In contrast to polyketide synthase-positive Escherichia coli (pks+ E. coli), ETBF does not produce a unique mutational signature; instead, ETBF-induced tumors arise from errors in DNA mismatch repair and homologous recombination DNA damage repair, established pathways of tumor formation in the colon, and the same genetic mechanism accounting for sham tumors in these mouse models.

In this paper, we applied whole-exome sequencing and whole-genome sequencing to investigate the impact of ETBF-induced genetic changes on tumor formation. Additionally, we performed whole-genome sequencing of human colon organoids exposed to ETBF to validate the mutational patterns seen in our mouse models and begin to understand their relevance in human colon epithelial cells.

Cancer stem cells (CSCs) play essential roles in CRC development. However, whether ETBF is involved in CSCs regulation is unknown. To clarify the role of ETBF in CSCs properties, we performed extreme limited dilution assays (ELDA) in nude mice injected with ETBF-treated or untreated CRC cells subcutaneously, tumor organoids culture in azoxymethane (AOM) mouse model after gavaging with or without ETBF, and cell sphere formation assay after incubating CRC cell lines with or without ETBF. The results indicated that ETBF increased the stemness of CRC cells in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, ETBF enhanced the expression of core stemness transcription factors Nanog homeobox (NANOG) and sex determining region Y-box 2 (SOX2). Histone H3 Lysine 9 trimethylation (H3K9me3) is critical in regulating CSCs properties. As an epigenetic and transcriptional regulator, JmjC-domain containing histone demethylase 2B (JMJD2B) is essential for embryonic stem cell (ESC) transformation and H3K9me3 demethylation. Mechanistically, ETBF infection significantly upregulated JMJD2B levels in CRC cell lines and nude mice xenograft model. JMJD2B epigenetically upregulated NANOG expression via demethylating its promoter H3K9me3, to mediate ETBF-induced stemness of CRC cells. Subsequently, we found that the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) pathway, activated by ETBF, contributed to the enhanced expression of JMJD2B via nuclear transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T cells 5 (NFAT5). Finally, in human CRC samples, the amount of ETBF positively correlated with nuclear NFAT5, JMJD2B, and NANOG expression levels.

All species were found to persist within tumour cell monolayers for a minimum of 48\u00a0h under standard aerobic cell culture conditions, with persistence significantly higher in HCT116 cells. Downstream assays were performed to analyse the behaviour of S/RG/C2 and HCT116 cells post-infection and revealed that all species increased the tumour cell yield of both cell lines. The migratory and invasive potential of HCT116 cells was increased after infection with F. nucleatum; however, no species significantly altered these characteristics in S/RG/C2 cells.

However, the impact of B. fragilis and ETBF on the clinical outcome of colorectal cancer (CRC) remains unclear. We aim to assess whether their presence affects the outcome in patients with CRC after curative resection.\nMETHODS: We obtained 197 pairs of matched formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples from cancerous and adjacent non-cancerous tissues of patients with pathological stage (pstage) II and III CRC after curative resection. The presence of B. fragilis and ETBF were estimated using real-time polymerase chain reaction, and recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) of the patients were analyzed.\nRESULTS: 16S rRNA for B. fragilis and bft DNA were detected in 120 (60.9%) and 12 (6.1%) of the 197 patients, respectively. B. fragilis-positive patients had better RFS than B. fragilis-negative patients, although that was not statistically significant. In subgroup analysis, better outcomes on RFS were observed in the presence of B. fragilis in pstage II and left-sided CRC. The association of B. fragilis positivity on OS was accentuated in the depth of T4 subgroup.

These effects are evident in CRC consensus molecular subtypes (CMS) where both CMS1 and CMS4 contain immune infiltrates yet have opposing prognoses. The microbiome has previously been associated with CRC and immune response in CRC but has largely been ignored in the CRC subtype discussion. We used CMS subtyping on surgical resections from patients and aimed to determine the contributions of the microbiome to the pleiotropic effects evident in immune-infiltrated subtypes. We integrated host gene-expression and meta-transcriptomic data to determine the link between immune characteristics and microbiome contributions in these subtypes and identified lipopolysaccharide (LPS) binding as a potential functional mechanism. We identified candidate bacteria with LPS properties that could affect immune response, and tested the effects of their LPS on cytokine production of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). We focused on Fusobacterium periodonticum and Bacteroides fragilis in CMS1, and Porphyromonas asaccharolytica in CMS4. Treatment of PBMCs with LPS isolated from these bacteria showed that F. periodonticum stimulates cytokine production in PBMCs while both B. fragilis and P. asaccharolytica had an inhibitory effect. Furthermore, LPS from the latter two species can inhibit the immunogenic properties of F. periodonticum LPS when co-incubated with PBMCs.

In addition to genetics, lifestyle, and chronic diseases, intestinal integrity and microbiota (which facilitate digestion, metabolism, and immune regulation) could promote CRC development. For example, enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis, genotoxic Escherichia coli (pks+ E. coli), and Fusobacterium nucleatum, members of the intestinal microbiota, are highly correlated in CRC. This review describes the roles and mechanisms of these three bacteria in CRC development. Their interaction during CRC initiation and progression has also been proposed. Our view is that in the precancerous stage of colorectal cancer, ETBF causes inflammation, leading to potential changes in intestinal ecology that may provide the basic conditions for pks+ E. coli colonization and induction of oncogenic mutations, when cancerous intestinal epithelial cells can further recruit F. nucleatum to colonise the lesion site and F. nucleatum may contribute to CRC advancement by primarily the development of cancer cells, stemization, and proliferation, which could create new and tailored preventive, screening and therapeutic interventions. However, there is the most dominant microbiota in each stage of CRC development, not neglecting the possibility that two or even all three bacteria could be engaged at any stage of the disease.

To fill this gap, we leveraged single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on wildtype mice and mouse model of CRC. We find that Fn and ETBF exacerbate cancer-like transcriptional phenotypes in transit-amplifying and mature enterocytes in a mouse model of CRC. We also observed increased T cells in the pathobiont-exposed mice, but these pathobiont-specific differences observed in wildtype mice were abrogated in the mouse model of CRC. Although there are similarities in the responses provoked by each organism, we find pathobiont-specific effects in Myc-signaling and fatty acid metabolism.

Species from the Bacteroides genus are ubiquitous commensals, comprising about thirty percent of the human gut microbiota. Bacteroides fragilis is one of the least abundant Bacteroides species, yet is the most common anaerobe isolated from extraintestinal infections in humans. A subset of B. fragilis strains carry a genetic element that encodes a metalloprotease enterotoxin named Bacteroides fragilis toxin, or BFT. Toxin-bearing strains, or Enterotoxigenic B. fragilis (ETBF) cause acute and chronic intestinal disease in children and adults. Despite this association with disease, around twenty percent of the human population appear to be asymptomatic carriers of ETBF. BFT damages the colonic epithelial barrier by inducing cleavage of the zonula adherens protein E-cadherin and initiating a cell signaling response characterized by inflammation and c-Myc-dependent pro-oncogenic hyperproliferation. As a consequence, mice harboring genetic mutations that predispose to colonic inflammation or tumor formation are uniquely susceptible to toxin-mediated injury. The recent observation of ETBF-bearing biofilms in colon biopsies from humans with colon cancer susceptibility loci strongly suggests that ETBF is a driver of colorectal cancer.

The goal of this review was to assess the status of the published evidence supporting (i) the association between ETBF and CRC and (ii) the causal role of ETBF in CRC. PubMed and Scopus searches were performed in August 2021 to identify human, animal, and cell studies pertaining to the role of ETBF in CRC. Inclusion criteria included the use of cell lines, mice, exposure to BFT or ETBF, and detection of bft. Review studies were excluded, and studies were limited to the English language. Quality of study design and risk of bias analysis was performed on the cell, animal, and human studies using ToxRTools, SYRCLE, and NOS, respectively. Ninety-five eligible studies were identified, this included 22 human studies, 24 animal studies, 43 cell studies, and 6 studies that included both cells and mice studies. We found that a large majority of studies supported an association or causal role of ETBF in CRC, as well as high levels of study bias was detected in the in vitro and in vivo studies. The high-level heterogeneity in study design and reporting made it difficult to synthesize these findings into a unified conclusion, suggesting that the need for future studies that include improved mechanistic models, longitudinal in vitro and in vivo evidence, and appropriate control of confounding factors will be required to confirm whether ETBF has a direct role in CRC etiopathogenesis.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27323816": "Evidences have shown that dysbiosis could promote the progression of colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the association of dysbiosis and prognosis of CRC is barely investigated. Therefore, we used 16S rRNA gene sequencing approach to determine differences in microbiota among tumor tissues of different prognosis and found that Fusobacterium nucleatum and Bacteroides fragilis were more abundant in worse prognosis groups, while Faecalibacterium prausnitzii displayed higher abundance in survival group. To further explore the prognostic value of the found bacteria, Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional regression analyses were used and the results exhibited that high abundance of F. nucleatum and B. fragilis were independent indicators of poor patient's survival. Besides, the expression of major inflammatory mediator were analyzed using PCR and western blot methods, and it turned out that high abundance of F. nucleatum was associated with increased expression of TNF-\u03b1, \u03b2-catenin and NF-\u03baB, while COX-2, MMP-9 and NF-\u03baB were positively related with high B. fragilis level, and high level of F. prausnitzii showed lower expression of \u03b2-catenin, MMP-9 and NF-\u03baB. Moreover, immunohistochemical analysis indicated that KRAS and BRAF expression were prominent in F. nucleatum and B. fragilis high abundance group, while MLH1 showed lower expression.

In the context of gastrointestinal disease, the bacterium enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis (ETBF) is a significant source of chronic inflammation and has been implicated as a risk factor for colorectal cancer. Spermine oxidase (SMO) is a polyamine catabolic enzyme that is highly inducible by inflammatory stimuli resulting in increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and DNA damage. We now demonstrate that purified B. fragilis toxin (BFT) up-regulates SMO in HT29/c1 and T84 colonic epithelial cells, resulting in SMO-dependent generation of ROS and induction of \u03b3-H2A.x, a marker of DNA damage. Further, ETBF-induced colitis in C57BL/6 mice is associated with increased SMO expression and treatment of mice with an inhibitor of polyamine catabolism, N(1),N(4)-bis(2,3-butandienyl)-1,4-butanediamine (MDL 72527), significantly reduces ETBF-induced chronic inflammation and proliferation. Most importantly, in the multiple intestinal neoplasia (Min) mouse model, treatment with MDL 72527 reduces ETBF-induced colon tumorigenesis by 69% (P < 0.001).

However, even when investigators have identified bacteria that express toxins, questions remain about the host determinants of a toxin's cancer-potentiating effects.

The pks\u2009+\u2009Escherichia coli promotes carcinogenesis and facilitates CRC progression through the production of colibactin, a genotoxin that induces double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs). ETBF is a procarcinogenic bacterium producing the B. fragilis toxin (bft) that promotes colorectal carcinogenesis by modulating the mucosal immune response and inducing epithelial cell changes.\nMETHODS: Fecal samples were collected from healthy controls (N\u2009=\u200962) and CRC patients (N\u2009=\u200994) from the province of Qu\u00e9bec (Canada), and a bacterial DNA extraction was performed. Fecal DNA samples were then examined for the presence of the pks island gene and bft using conventional qualitative PCR.\nRESULTS: We found that a high proportion of healthy controls are colonized by pks\u2009+\u2009bacteria (42%) and that these levels were similar in CRC patients (46%). bft was detected in 21% of healthy controls and 32% of CRC patients, while double colonization by both pks\u2009+\u2009bacteria and ETBF occurred in 8% of the healthy controls and 13% of the CRC patients. Most importantly, we found that early-onset CRC (<\u200950\u00a0years) patients were significantly less colonized with pks\u2009+\u2009bacteria (20%) compared to late-onset CRC patients (52%).\nCONCLUSIONS: Healthy controls had similar levels of pks\u2009+\u2009bacteria and ETBF colonization as CRC patients, and their elevated levels may place both groups at greater risk of developing CRC.

F actin distribution was assessed using confocal microscopy.\nRESULTS: Serosal BFT-2 for four hours was four-, two-, seven-, and threefold more potent than luminal BFT-2 in decreasing resistance, increasing epithelial 3H-mannitol permeability, and damaging crypt and surface colonocytes, respectively (p<0.05).

ETBF strains are associated with inflammatory diarrheal disease in children older than 1 year of age and in adults; limited data suggest an association of ETBF colonization with inflammatory bowel disease flare-ups and colorectal cancer. ETBF secretes one of three highly related BFT isoforms. The relationship between BFT isoform and disease expression is unknown. Although the mechanism of action of BFT is incompletely understood, available data suggest that BFT binds to a specific intestinal epithelial cell receptor, stimulating intestinal cell signal transduction pathways that result in cell morphology changes, cleavage of E-cadherin, reduced colonic barrier function, and increased epithelial cell proliferation and cytokine expression (such as the proinflammatory chemokine interleukin-8).

However, recent studies of gram-negative bacteria have shown that outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) could be an essential mechanism for the spread of a large number of virulence factors. Here, we show for the first time that BFT is not a freely secreted protease but is associated with OMVs. Our findings indicate that only outer surface-exposed BFT causes epithelial cell contact disruption. According to our in silico models confirmed by Trp quenching assay and NMR, BFT has special interactions with outer membrane components such as phospholipids and is secreted during vesicle formation.

Single bacterial colonies isolated anaerobically from mucosal colon tissue were tested for the bft gene with touch-down polymerase chain reaction.\nRESULTS: The mucosa of cases was significantly more often bft-positive on left (85.7%) and right (91.7%) tumor and/or paired normal tissues compared with left and right control biopsies (53.1%; P = .033 and 55.5%; P = .04, respectively).

Inhibition of Stat3 resulted in a decrease in IL-8 gene and protein expression in response to ETBF in both cell lines. A reduction in E-cadherin expression in response to ETBF treatment was not restored by blocking Stat3.\nCONCLUSION: We found that treatment of colorectal cancer cell lines with live cultures of ETBF had the equivalent effect on IL-8 expression as the use of purified toxin, and this may be a more representative model of ETBF-mediated colorectal carcinogenesis.

A disturbance of this balance towards increased levels of the bacteria Fusobacterium nucleatum and Bacteroides fragilis is associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer. The mechanisms involved include the release of toxins which activate inflammation and the regulation of specific miRNAs (with an increase in the expression of oncogenic miRNAs and a decrease in the expression of tumour suppressor miRNAs), thereby increasing cell proliferation and leading to tumorigenesis. On the other hand, Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium have a protective effect against the development of colorectal cancer through mechanisms that involve an increase in the levels of anticarcinogenic metabolites such as butyrate and a decrease in the activity of proinflammatory pathways.

In specific-pathogen-free (SPF) C57BL/6 wild-type (WT) and multiple intestinal neoplasia (MinApc716+/-) mice, we show that sequential treatment of the NTBF strain, 9343, followed by the ETBF strain, 86-5443-2-2 (86), diminished colitis and tumorigenesis. Mice treated simultaneously with 9343 and 86 exhibited both severe colitis and tumorigenesis. Abrogated disease severity in sequentially treated mice was attributed to 9343 strain dominance and decreased IL-17A, but 86 colonization prior to or simultaneous with 9343 mitigated the anti-inflammatory effect of 9343. Remarkably, 9343-mediated protection was independent of PSA, as sequentially treated mice receiving \u0394PSA 9343 exhibited similar protection. Further, SPF WT and Min mice colonized with PSA-competent or PSA-deficient 9343 exhibited similar IL-10, IL-17, and IFN-\u03b3 responses.

Patients with CRC showed increased levels of Bacteroides, Prevotella, Escherichia coli, enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis, Streptococcus gallolyticus, Enterococcus faecalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum (F. nucleatum) and Clostridium difficile. Higher levels of Bacteroides have been found in African American (AA) compared to Caucasian American (CA) patients.

The alpha-bug hypothesis suggested that oncogenic bacteria such as enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis (ETBF) induce the development of CRC through direct interactions with colonic epithelial cells and alterations of microbiota composition at the colorectal site. Escherichia coli, E. faecalis, F. nucleatum, and Streptococcus gallolyticus showed higher abundance whereas Bifidobacterium, Clostridium, Faecalibacterium, and Roseburia showed reduced abundance in CRC patients. The alterations of gut microbiota may be used as potential therapeutic approaches to prevent or treat CRC. Probiotics such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium inhibit the growth of CRC through inhibiting inflammation and angiogenesis and enhancing the function of the intestinal barrier through the secretion of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs).

While cancer is largely considered to be a disease of genetic and environmental factors, increasing evidence has demonstrated a role for the microbiota (the microorganisms associated with the human body) in shaping inflammatory environments and promoting tumor growth and spread. Herein, we discuss both human data from meta'omics analyses and data from mechanistic studies in cell culture and animal models that support specific bacterial agents as potentiators of tumorigenesis-including Fusobacterium nucleatum, enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis, and colibactin-producing Escherichia coli. Further, we consider how microbes can be used in diagnosing colorectal cancer and manipulating the tumor environment to encourage better patient outcomes in response to immunotherapy treatments.", "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35587635/": "Enterotoxigenic Bacteroides fragilis (ETBF) is consistently found at higher frequency in individuals with sporadic and hereditary colorectal cancer (CRC) and induces tumorigenesis in several mouse models of CRC. However, whether specific mutations induced by ETBF lead to colon tumor formation has not been investigated. To determine if ETBF-induced mutations impact the Apc gene, and other tumor suppressors or proto-oncogenes, we performed whole-exome sequencing and whole-genome sequencing on tumors isolated after ETBF and sham colonization of Apcmin/+ and Apcmin/+Msh2fl/flVC mice, as well as whole-genome sequencing of organoids cocultured with ETBF. Our results indicate that ETBF-induced tumor formation results from loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of Apc, unless the mismatch repair system is disrupted, in which case, tumor formation results from new acquisition of protein-truncating mutations in Apc. In contrast to polyketide synthase-positive Escherichia coli (pks+ E. coli), ETBF does not produce a unique mutational signature; instead, ETBF-induced tumors arise from errors in DNA mismatch repair and homologous recombination DNA damage repair, established pathways of tumor formation in the colon, and the same genetic mechanism accounting for sham tumors in these mouse models. Our analysis informs how this procarcinogenic bacterium may promote tumor formation in individuals with inherited predispositions to CRC, such as Lynch syndrome or familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). IMPORTANCE Many studies have shown that microbiome composition in both the mucosa and the stool differs in individuals with sporadic and hereditary colorectal cancer (CRC). Both human and mouse models have established a strong association between particular microbes and colon tumor induction. However, the genetic mechanisms underlying putative microbe-induced colon tumor formation are not well established. In this paper, we applied whole-exome sequencing and whole-genome sequencing to investigate the impact of ETBF-induced genetic changes on tumor formation. Additionally, we performed whole-genome sequencing of human colon organoids exposed to ETBF to validate the mutational patterns seen in our mouse models and begin to understand their relevance in human colon epithelial cells. The results of this study highlight the importance of ETBF colonization in the development of sporadic CRC and in individuals with hereditary tumor conditions, such as Lynch syndrome and familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP).", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36173175": "Bacteroides fragilis is an abundant commensal component of the healthy human colon. However, under dysbiotic conditions, enterotoxigenic B. fragilis (ETBF) may arise and elicit diarrhea, anaerobic bacteremia, inflammatory bowel disease, and colorectal cancer. Most worrisome, ETBF is resistant to many disparate antibiotics. ETBF's only recognized specific virulence factor is a zinc-dependent metallopeptidase (MP) called B. fragilis toxin (BFT) or fragilysin, which damages the intestinal mucosa and triggers disease-related signaling mechanisms. Thus, therapeutic targeting of BFT is expected to limit ETBF pathogenicity and improve the prognosis for patients. We focused on one of the naturally occurring BFT isoforms, BFT-3, and managed to repurpose several approved drugs as BFT-3 inhibitors through a combination of biophysical, biochemical, structural, and cellular techniques. In contrast to canonical MP inhibitors, which target the active site of mature enzymes, these effectors bind to a distal allosteric site in the proBFT-3 zymogen structure, which stabilizes a partially unstructured, zinc-free enzyme conformation by shifting a zinc-dependent disorder-to-order equilibrium. This yields proBTF-3 incompetent for autoactivation, thus ablating hydrolytic activity of the mature toxin. Additionally, a similar destabilizing effect is observed for the activated protease according to biophysical and biochemical data.

A murine model for ETBF has not been characterized. Specific pathogen-free (SPF) C57BL/6J or germfree 129S6/SvEv mice were orally inoculated with wild-type ETBF (WT-ETBF) strains, a nontoxigenic WT strain of B. fragilis (WT-NTBF), WT-NTBF overexpressing bft (rETBF), or WT-NTBF overexpressing a biologically inactive mutated bft (rNTBF). In SPF and germfree mice, ETBF caused colitis but was lethal only in germfree mice. Colonic histopathology demonstrated mucosal thickening with inflammatory cell infiltration, crypt abscesses, and epithelial cell exfoliation, erosion, and ulceration. SPF mice colonized with rETBF mimicked WT-ETBF, whereas rNTBF caused no histopathology. Intestinal epithelial E-cadherin was rapidly cleaved in vivo in WT-ETBF-colonized mice and in vitro in intestinal tissues cultured with purified BFT. ETBF mice colonized for 16 months exhibited persistent colitis. BFT did not directly induce lymphocyte proliferation, dendritic cell stimulation, or Toll-like receptor activation. In conclusion, WT-ETBF induced acute then persistent colitis in SPF mice and rapidly lethal colitis in WT germfree mice.

However, asymptomatic ETBF colonization is common. Through its primary virulence factor, B. fragilis toxin (BFT), ETBF causes asymptomatic, chronic colitis in C57BL/6 mice and increased colon tumorigenesis in multiple intestinal neoplasia mice. Human studies suggest an association between ETBF infection, inflammatory bowel disease, and colon cancer. Additional studies on ETBF epidemiology are, therefore, crucial. The goal of this study is to develop a reliable fecal diagnostic for ETBF. To develop a sensitive assay for ETBF, we tested multiple protocols on mouse stools spiked with serially diluted ETBF. Each assay was based on either touchdown or quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and used primers targeted to bft to detect ETBF. Using touchdown PCR or qPCR, the mean ETBF detection limit was 1.55\u2009\u00d7\u200910(6) colony-forming units (CFU)/g stool and 1.33\u2009\u00d7\u200910(4) CFU/g stool, respectively. Augmentation of Bacteroides spp. growth in fecal samples using PYGB (Peptone Yeast Glucose with Bile) broth enhanced ETBF detection to 2.93\u2009\u00d7\u200910(2) CFU/g stool using the touchdown PCR method and 2.63\u2009\u00d7\u200910(2) CFU/g stool using the qPCR method. Fecal testing using combined culture-based amplification and bft touchdown PCR is a sensitive assay for the detection of ETBF colonization and should be useful in studying the role of ETBF colonization in intestinal diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease and colon cancer.

This is a 21-kDa zinc-dependent metallopeptidase existing in three closely related isoforms that hydrolyze E-cadherin and contribute to secretory diarrhea, and possibly to inflammatory bowel disease and colorectal cancer. Here we studied the function and zymogenic structure of fragilysin-3 and found that its activity is repressed by a \u223c170-residue prodomain, which is the largest hitherto structurally characterized for a metallopeptidase. This prodomain plays a role in both the latency and folding stability of the catalytic domain and it has no significant sequence similarity to any known protein. The prodomain adopts a novel fold and inhibits the protease domain via an aspartate-switch mechanism. The catalytic fragilysin-3 moiety is active against several protein substrates and its structure reveals a new family prototype within the metzincin clan of metallopeptidases. It shows high structural similarity despite negligible sequence identity to adamalysins/ADAMs, which have only been described in eukaryotes. Because no similar protein has been found outside enterotoxigenic B. fragilis, our findings support that fragilysins derived from a mammalian adamalysin/ADAM xenolog that was co-opted by B. fragilis through a rare case of horizontal gene transfer from a eukaryotic cell to a bacterial cell.

First, IDH mutations can produce high levels of 2-hydroxyglutaric acid (2-HG), thereby inhibiting glioma stem cell differentiation. At the same time, IDH mutations can upregulate vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) to promote the formation of the tumor microenvironment. In addition, IDH mutations can also induce high levels of hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) to promote glioma invasion. Ultimately, these changes will lead to the development of glioma.

IDH mutations involve the catalytic pocket of the enzyme and lead to a neomorphic ability to produce 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) while oxidizing NADPH to NADP+. 2HG is considered as an 'oncometabolite' which is thought to be responsible for many, if not all, biologic effects of IDH mutations. 2HG accumulation competitively inhibits \u03b1-KG-dependent dioxygenases, including histone lysine demethylases and DNA demethylases, resulting in a hypermethylation phenotype with alterations in cellular epigenetic status as well as a block in cellular differentiation. IDH mutations have been suggested as an important early event in tumorigenesis, however it remains unclear whether IDH mutation by itself causes cancer or if it requires other oncogenic events to initiate tumorigenesis.

Subgroup analysis showed a consistent result with pooled analysis, and patients with glioma of WHO grade III or II-III had better outcomes.\nCONCLUSIONS: These findings provide further indication that patients with glioma harboring IDH mutations have improved OS and PFS, especially for patients with WHO grade III and grade II-III.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30427756": "Introduction: Mutations in the genes isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) 1 and 2 have been reported in a limited number of tumors. In gliomas, IDH mutations are primarily detected in WHO grade II-III tumors and represent a major biomarker with diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive implications. The recent development of IDH inhibitors and vaccines suggests that the IDH mutation is also an appealing target for therapy. Areas covered: This review focuses on the role of IDH mutations in diffuse gliomas. Besides discussing their role in gliomagenesis, we will emphasize the role of IDH mutations in clinical practice as a diagnostic, prognostic and predictive biomarker, and as a potential therapeutic target. Noninvasive detection of the IDH mutation by means of liquid biopsy and MR spectroscopy will also be discussed. Expert commentary: While IDH mutation is a consolidated diagnostic and prognostic biomarker in clinical practice, its role in oncogenesis is far from being elucidated, and there are several pending issues. The routine use of noninvasive techniques for detection and monitoring of the IDH status remains challenging. Although the IDH mutation is a very early alteration in gliomagenesis, it may then be omitted during tumor progression. This observation has important implications when designing targeted clinical trials.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28980701": "The metabolic genes isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) and IDH2 are commonly mutated in low-grade glioma and in a subset of glioblastoma.

The present review describes the physiopathological mechanisms by which IDH mutations lead to tumorigenesis, discussing their prognostic significance and pivotal role in the gliomas diagnostic classification system. We critically review preclinical evidence and available clinical data of first-generation mutant-selective IDH inhibitors and novel IDH-targeted vaccines.

In heavily pretreated patients with mIDH glioma, enzyme inhibitors demonstrated to be well tolerated with preliminary evidence of clinical activity in nonenhancing tumors and enhancing tumors when used as single agents.

Most notably, cytosolic IDH1 is mutated in 70-90% of low-grade gliomas and upgraded glioblastomas, and mitochondrial IDH2 is mutated in ~20% of acute myeloid leukemia cases. Wild-type IDH catalyzes the interconversion of isocitrate to \u03b1-ketoglutarate (\u03b1-KG). Mutations in the enzyme lead to loss of wild-type enzymatic activity and a neomorphic activity that converts \u03b1-KG to 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG). In turn, 2-HG, which has been termed an \"oncometabolite,\" inhibits key \u03b1-KG-dependent enzymes, resulting in alterations of the cellular epigenetic profile and, subsequently, inhibition of differentiation and initiation of tumorigenesis. In addition, it is now clear that the IDH mutation also induces a broad metabolic reprograming that extends beyond 2-HG production, and this reprograming often differs from what has been previously reported in other cancer types. In this review, we will discuss in detail what is known to date about the metabolic reprograming of mutant IDH cells, and how this reprograming has been investigated using molecular metabolic imaging. We will describe how metabolic imaging has helped shed light on the basic biology of mutant IDH cells, and how this information can be leveraged to identify new therapeutic targets and to develop new clinically translatable imaging methods to detect and monitor mutant IDH tumors in vivo.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32965568": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation status has important prognostic implications in glioma patients, with IDH wild-type (IDH-WT) gliomas being associated with worse prognosis and shorter survival when compared with IDH mutant (IDH-mut) gliomas. Optimization of quality of life is a priority in the management of glioma patients. The goal of this systematic review was to identify studies that explored the association of IDH mutation status with patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and cognitive functioning of glioma patients.\nRECENT FINDINGS: Studies that evaluated the association of IDH mutation status with PROs and/or cognitive functioning of glioma patients were identified from the Pubmed/MEDLINE, Clarivate analytics, and Google Scholar databases. Eight studies (7 journal articles and 2 conference abstracts) with a total of 658 low-grade glioma and high-grade glioma patients investigated the association of cognitive functioning and/or QoL with IDH status. IDH-WT status was associated with greater cognitive impairment relative to IDH-Mut status in three studies, while one study did not find the association between IDH status and perioperative cognitive functioning. One study reported worse postoperative cognitive functioning patients with IDH-WT vs. IDH-mut gliomas. In one study, IDH-WT status was linked to greater impairment on physical and communication functioning after surgery. IDH-WT gliomas are associated with greater cognitive burden than IDH-Mut tumors. The association of IDH status with QoL remains less clear. Assessment of IDH status should be considered when evaluating QoL and cognitive complaints of glioma patients.

Mutations in IDH genes are thought to occur early in tumorigenesis and define a subgroup of glioma that are characterized by specific metabolic changes and improved prognosis. At present, assays identifying tumors with IDH1 mutations are clinically useful as prognostic markers.

The mutations universally affect codons 132 in IDH1 and 172 in IDH2 and result in decreased enzymatic activity. The oncogenic pathway triggered by IDH mutations may involve the activation of hypoxia-inducible factor pathway as well as the acquisition of a novel (gain of enzymatic) function consuming NADPH and generating \u03b1-hydroxyglutarate. Most intriguingly, IDH mutations are observed in \u223c70-80% of grade II/III gliomas and the majority of secondary glioblastomas, but only 10% of primary glioblastomas, suggesting a different cellular origin of the gliomas, which had previously been viewed as a multistep process of malignant progression.

The following search terms were used: IDH, IDH1, IDH2, and isocitrate dehydrogenase, in conjunction with glioma or leukemia. The search was limited to articles published in English. Further hand searching was performed using a review of the pertinent references from the identified publications. All identified original articles were investigated for content and critiqued by Z.T. and S.D.\nFINDINGS: IDH mutation is an early event in gliomagenesis and has significant implications for glioma progression and tumor behavior.

IDH mutations are oncogenic, although whether the mechanism is through alterations in hydroxylases, redox potential, cellular metabolism, or gene expression is not clear. The mutations also drive increased methylation in gliomas. Gliomas with mutated IDH1 and IDH2 have improved prognosis compared with gliomas with wild-type IDH.

Oligodendrogliomas show frequent loss at 1p/19q (about 70% of cases), which is associated with longer survival. With respect to clinical outcome, molecular classification on the basis of IDH1/2 mutations, TP53 mutations, and 1p/19q loss showed a predictive power similar to histological classification.

IDH1/2 mutations are the most significant predictor of favorable outcome of glioblastoma patients. The high frequency of IDH1/2 mutations in oligodendrogliomas, astrocytomas, and secondary glioblastomas derived thereof suggests these tumors share a common progenitor cell population.

Genotyping of 145 AML biopsies identified 11 IDH1 R132 mutant samples.

The IDH1 R132C mutation commonly found in AML reduces the affinity for isocitrate, and increases the affinity for NADPH and alpha-KG. This prevents the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to alpha-KG, and facilitates the conversion of alpha-KG to 2-HG.

These include: (1) the accurate and reliable measurement of many exposures in the external environment, (2) the measurement of a wide range of biological responses in the internal environment, and (3) addressing the dynamic, life course nature of the exposome. New tools and technologies that can be applied to address these challenges include exposure biomarker technologies, geographical mapping and remote sensing technologies, smartphone applications and personal exposure sensors, and high-throughput molecular 'omics' techniques. Prospective, population-based cohort studies have recently started to implement these methods using the exposome framework. The exposome thus offers a new and exciting paradigm for improvement and integration of currently scattered and uncertain data on the environmental component in disease aetiology. This should lead to a better understanding of the role of environmental risk factors in respiratory disease and other chronic pathologies, and ultimately to better primary prevention strategies.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24767943": "The concept of the Exposome is a compilation of diseases and one's lifetime exposure to chemicals, whether the exposure comes from environmental, dietary, or occupational exposures; or endogenous chemicals that are formed from normal metabolism, inflammation, oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation, infections, and other natural metabolic processes such as alteration of the gut microbiome. In this review, we have focused on the endogenous exposome, the DNA damage that arises from the production of endogenous electrophilic molecules in our cells. It provides quantitative data on endogenous DNA damage and its relationship to mutagenesis, with emphasis on when exogenous chemical exposures that produce identical DNA adducts to those arising from normal metabolism cause significant increases in total identical DNA adducts. We have utilized stable isotope labeled chemical exposures of animals and cells, so that accurate relationships between endogenous and exogenous exposures can be determined. Advances in mass spectrometry have vastly increased both the sensitivity and accuracy of such studies. Furthermore, we have clear evidence of which sources of exposure drive low dose biology that results in mutations and disease. These data provide much needed information to impact quantitative risk assessments, in the hope of moving towards the use of science, rather than default assumptions.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26475350": "Under the exposome paradigm all nongenetic factors contributing to disease are considered to be 'environmental' including chemicals, drugs, infectious agents, and psychosocial stress. We can consider these collectively as environmental stressors. Exposomics is the comprehensive analysis of exposure to all environmental stressors and should yield a more thorough understanding of chronic disease development. We can operationalize exposomics by studying all the small molecules in the body and their influence on biological pathways that lead to impaired health. Here, we describe methods by which this may be achieved and discuss the application of exposomics to cumulative risk assessment in vulnerable populations. Since the goal of cumulative risk assessment is to analyze, characterize, and quantify the combined risks to health from exposures to multiple agents or stressors, it seems that exposomics is perfectly poised to advance this important area of environmental health science. We should therefore support development of tools for exposomic analysis and begin to engage impacted communities in participatory exposome research. A first step may be to apply exposomics to vulnerable populations already studied by more conventional cumulative risk approaches. We further propose that recent migrants, low socioeconomic groups with high environmental chemical exposures, and pregnant women should be high priority populations for study by exposomics. Moreover, exposomics allows us to study interactions between chronic stress and environmental chemicals that disrupt stress response pathways (i.e., 'stressogens'). Exploring the impact of early life exposures and maternal stress may be an interesting and accessible topic for investigation by exposomics using biobanked samples.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28669935": "The environment plays a major role in human health, yet tools to study the health impacts of complex environmental exposures are lacking. In 2005, Christopher Wild introduced the concept of the exposome, which encompasses environmental exposures and concomitant biological responses throughout the life course. Exposome-based approaches have the potential to enable novel insights into numerous research questions in environmental health sciences. To promote and develop the concept of the exposome, the Health and Exposome Research Center: Understanding Lifetime Exposures (HERCULES) Exposome Research Center at Emory University held the first Emory Exposome Summer Course from 13-17 June 2016. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP1712.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29295136": "Scientific advancement and the development of new research fields bring uncertainties about what the current topics of research emphasis are and thus, what new knowledge might need to be represented. The exposome is an example of one such new field for which these uncertainties exist. The exposome is the analogue to the genome, from an environmental exposure perspective; research on the exposome has gained momentum only since 2011. In this work, we propose a generally applicable methodology that aims to characterise the landscape of a new research area based on linguistic analysis of its associated publications. Using abstracts of 261 exposome research articles, we illustrate a methodology that combines (1) inductive analysis based on word frequency counts, and term analysis to identify the topics, methods and applications of the new field and (2) deductive analysis using the NCBO Ontology Recommender to identify to what extent this new area is covered by current knowledge representation tools. Applying this method to the exposome literature, we uncover both the current focus of exposome research and the ontologies that are most relevant to the domain.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25378312": "The exposome is defined as the totality of all human environmental exposures from conception to death. It is often regarded as the complement to the genome, with the interaction between the exposome and the genome ultimately determining one's phenotype. The 'toxic exposome' is the complete collection of chronically or acutely toxic compounds to which humans can be exposed. Considerable interest in defining the toxic exposome has been spurred on by the realization that most human injuries, deaths and diseases are directly or indirectly caused by toxic substances found in the air, water, food, home or workplace. The Toxin-Toxin-Target Database (T3DB--www.t3db.ca) is a resource that was specifically designed to capture information about the toxic exposome. Originally released in 2010, the first version of T3DB contained data on nearly 2900 common toxic substances along with detailed information on their chemical properties, descriptions, targets, toxic effects, toxicity thresholds, sequences (for both targets and toxins), mechanisms and references. To more closely align itself with the needs of epidemiologists, toxicologists and exposome scientists, the latest release of T3DB has been substantially upgraded to include many more compounds (>3600), targets (>2000) and gene expression datasets (>15,000 genes). It now includes extensive data on 'normal' toxic compound concentrations in human biofluids as well as detailed chemical taxonomies, informative chemical ontologies and a large number of referential NMR, MS/MS and GC-MS spectra. This manuscript describes the most recent update to the T3DB, which was previously featured in the 2010 NAR Database Issue.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34886409": "Emerging research suggests environmental exposures before conception may adversely affect allergies and lung diseases in future generations. Most studies are limited as they have focused on single exposures, not considering that these diseases have a multifactorial origin in which environmental and lifestyle factors are likely to interact. Traditional exposure assessment methods fail to capture the interactions among environmental exposures and their impact on fundamental biological processes, as well as individual and temporal factors. A valid estimation of exposure preconception is difficult since the human reproductive cycle spans decades and the access to germ cells is limited. The exposome is defined as the cumulative measure of external exposures on an organism (external exposome), and the associated biological responses (endogenous exposome) throughout the lifespan, from conception and onwards. An exposome approach implies a targeted or agnostic analysis of the concurrent and temporal multiple exposures, and may, together with recent technological advances, improve the assessment of the environmental contributors to health and disease. This review describes the current knowledge on preconception environmental exposures as related to respiratory health outcomes in offspring. We discuss the usefulness and feasibility of using an exposome approach in this research, advocating for the preconception exposure window to become included in the exposome concept.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31953830": "The exposome is the cumulative measure of environmental influences and associated biological responses across the\u00a0life span, with critical relevance for understanding how exposures can impact human health. Metabolomics analysis of biological samples offers unique advantages for examining the exposome. Simultaneous analysis of external exposures, biological responses, and host susceptibility at a systems level can help establish links between external exposures and health outcomes. As metabolomics technologies continue to evolve for the study of the exposome, metabolomics ultimately will help provide valuable insights for exposure risk assessment, and disease prevention and management. Here, we discuss recent advances in metabolomics, and describe data processing protocols that can enable analysis of the exposome. This chapter focuses on using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based untargeted metabolomics for analysis of the exposome, including (1) preprocessing of untargeted metabolomics data, (2) identification of exposure chemicals and their metabolites, and (3) methods to establish associations between exposures and diseases.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30095351": "Derived from the term exposure, the exposome is an omic-scale characterization of the nongenetic drivers of health and disease. With the genome, it defines the phenome of an individual. The measurement of complex environmental factors that exert pressure on our health has not kept pace with genomics and historically has not provided a similar level of resolution. Emerging technologies make it possible to obtain detailed information on drugs, toxicants, pollutants, nutrients, and physical and psychological stressors on an omic scale. These forces can also be assessed at systems and network levels, providing a framework for advances in pharmacology and toxicology. The exposome paradigm can improve the analysis of drug interactions and detection of adverse effects of drugs and toxicants and provide data on biological responses to exposures. The comprehensive model can provide data at the individual level for precision medicine, group level for clinical trials, and population level for public health.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34629184": "The influence of environmental factors on an individual, from conception onwards, is defined as the exposome. It can be categorized into the external exposome, which includes external factors such as air pollution, chemical contaminants, and diet, and the internal exposome, which is unique to an individual, and involves age, physiology, and their genetic profile. The effect of external exposures on the internal exposome, or genetic profile, can be determined through omics analyses. However, this is often compromised due to low sample quantity and cost. Therefore, identification of other factors that can provide an insight into the cellular profile of an individual, provides an exciting avenue, and an emerging field is that of extracellular vesicles (EVs). Recently, our understanding of how cells can communicate with each other has shifted to recognise the role of EVs. EVs are secreted by all living cells, and have been identified in all biological fluids studied so far. They transport bioactive molecules (e.g., proteins, miRNAs, and DNA), and their release can be regulated by the cellular microenvironment. Analysis of EVs in respond to environmental factors might provide novel insights into the role of tumour EVs in carcinogenesis. Not only will EVs give some insight into the tumour cells themselves but they will also provide a better understanding of how cells communicate with one another, contributing to cancer progression. Moreover, characterising the content and functions of tumour-derived EVs has the potential to overcome the current challenges to improve cancer patient outcomes. For example, the identification of EVs targets for therapeutic interventions and tumour EVs biomarkers could facilitate the development of early screening for several cancers. The aim of this review, thus, is to discuss the overall role of EVs in response to the various external and internal signals in cancer. We will specifically highlight the biogenesis, secretion, and content of EVs in response to oncogenic transformation and metabolic regulators in cancer.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32619912": "The exposome concept refers to the totality of exposures from a variety of external and internal sources including chemical agents, biological agents, or radiation, from conception onward, over a complete lifetime. It encompasses also \"psychosocial components\" including the impact of social relations and socio-economic position on health. In this review we provide examples of recent contributions from exposome research, where we believe their application will be of the greatest value for moving forward. So far, environmental epidemiology has mainly focused on hard outcomes, such as mortality, disease exacerbation and hospitalizations. However, there are many subtle outcomes that can be related to environmental exposures, and investigations can be facilitated by an improved understanding of internal biomarkers of exposure and response, through the application of omic technologies. Second, though we have a wealth of studies on environmental pollutants, the assessment of causality is often difficult because of confounding, reverse causation and other uncertainties. Biomarkers and omic technologies may allow better causal attribution, for example using instrumental variables in triangulation, as we discuss here. Even more complex is the understanding of how social relationships (in particular socio-economic differences) influence health and imprint on the fundamental biology of the individual. The identification of molecular changes that are intermediate between social determinants and disease status is a way to fill the gap. Another field in which biomarkers and omics are relevant is the study of mixtures. Epidemiology often deals with complex mixtures (e.g. ambient air pollution, food, smoking) without fully disentangling the compositional complexity of the mixture, or with rudimentary approaches to reflect the overall effect of multiple exposures or components. From the point of view of disease mechanisms, most models hypothesize that several stages need to be transitioned through health to the induction of disease, but very little is known about the characteristics and temporal sequence of such stages. Exposome models reinforce the idea of a biography-to-biology transition, in that everyone's disease is the product of the individual history of exposures, superimposed on their underlying genetic susceptibilities. Finally, exposome research is facilitated by technological developments that complement traditional epidemiological study designs. We describe in depth one such new tools, adductomics. In general, the development of high-resolution and high-throughput technologies interrogating multiple -omics (such as epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, adductomics and metabolomics) yields an unprecedented perspective into the impact of the environment in its widest sense on disease. The world of the exposome is rapidly evolving, though a huge gap still needs to be filled between the original expectations and the concrete achievements. Perhaps the most urgent need is for the establishment of a new generation of cohort studies with appropriately specified biosample collection, improved questionnaire data (including social variables), and the deployment of novel technologies that allow better characterization of individual environmental exposures, ranging from personal monitoring to satellite based observations.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35004129": "The exposome, which is defined as the cumulative effect of environmental exposures and corresponding biological responses, aims to provide a comprehensive measure for evaluating non-genetic causes of disease. Operationalization of the exposome for environmental health and precision medicine has been limited by the lack of a universal approach for characterizing complex exposures, particularly as they vary temporally and geographically. To overcome these challenges, passive sampling devices (PSDs) provide a key measurement strategy for deep exposome phenotyping, which aims to provide comprehensive chemical assessment using untargeted high-resolution mass spectrometry for exposome-wide association studies. To highlight the advantages of silicone PSDs, we review their use in population studies and evaluate the broad range of applications and chemical classes characterized using these samplers. We assess key aspects of incorporating PSDs within observational studies, including the need to preclean samplers prior to use to remove impurities that interfere with compound detection, analytical considerations, and cost. We close with strategies on how to incorporate measures of the external exposome using PSDs, and their advantages for reducing variability in exposure measures and providing a more thorough accounting of the exposome. Continued development and application of silicone PSDs will facilitate greater understanding of how environmental exposures drive disease risk, while providing a feasible strategy for incorporating untargeted, high-resolution characterization of the external exposome in human studies.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26358001": "The exposome is the cumulative measure of environmental influences and associated biological responses throughout the lifespan, including exposures from the environment, diet, behavior, and endogenous processes. A major challenge for exposome research lies in the development of robust and affordable analytic procedures to measure the broad range of exposures and associated biologic impacts occurring over a lifetime. Biomonitoring is an established approach to evaluate internal body burden of environmental exposures, but use of biomonitoring for exposome research is often limited by the high costs associated with quantification of individual chemicals. High-resolution metabolomics (HRM) uses ultra-high resolution mass spectrometry with minimal sample preparation to support high-throughput relative quantification of thousands of environmental, dietary, and microbial chemicals. HRM also measures metabolites in most endogenous metabolic pathways, thereby providing simultaneous measurement of biologic responses to environmental exposures. The present research examined quantification strategies to enhance the usefulness of HRM data for cumulative exposome research. The results provide a simple reference standardization protocol in which individual chemical concentrations in unknown samples are estimated by comparison to a concurrently analyzed, pooled reference sample with known chemical concentrations. The approach was tested using blinded analyses of amino acids in human samples and was found to be comparable to independent laboratory results based on surrogate standardization or internal standardization. Quantification was reproducible over a 13-month period and extrapolated to thousands of chemicals. The results show that reference standardization protocol provides an effective strategy that will enhance data collection for cumulative exposome research. In principle, the approach can be extended to other types of mass spectrometry and other analytical methods.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31009264": "BACKGROUND: The exposome is defined as the totality of environmental exposures from conception onwards. It calls for providing a holistic view of environmental exposures and their effects on human health by evaluating multiple environmental exposures simultaneously during critical periods of life.\nOBJECTIVE: We evaluated the association of the urban exposome with birth weight.\nMETHODS: We estimated exposure to the urban exposome, including the built environment, air pollution, road traffic noise, meteorology, natural space, and road traffic (corresponding to 24 environmental indicators and 60 exposures) for nearly 32,000 pregnant women from six European birth cohorts. To evaluate associations with either continuous birth weight or term low birth weight (TLBW) risk, we primarily relied on the Deletion-Substitution-Addition (DSA) algorithm, which is an extension of the stepwise variable selection method. Second, we used an exposure-by-exposure exposome-wide association studies (ExWAS) method accounting for multiple hypotheses testing to report associations not adjusted for coexposures.\nRESULTS: The most consistent statistically significant associations were observed between increasing green space exposure estimated as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and increased birth weight and decreased TLBW risk. Furthermore, we observed statistically significant associations among presence of public bus line, land use Shannon's Evenness Index, and traffic density and birth weight in our DSA analysis.\nCONCLUSION: This investigation is the first large urban exposome study of birth weight that tests many environmental urban exposures.

However, initial applications of the exposome concept have been less apt at measuring social determinants of health, focusing primarily on conventional environmental exposures and lifestyle choices that do not reflect the complex lived experience of many communities. To bring community voice into the exposome concept, the HERCULES Exposome Research Center and its Stakeholder Advisory Board co-developed the Exposome Roadshow. We present and discuss the resulting community-exposome definition to inform and improve exposome research.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS: Four communities from distinct areas across metro-Atlanta participated in separate 2-day Exposome Roadshow workshops with concept mapping. Aligned with a popular education approach in which community knowledge is used to work collectively for change, concept mapping provided a systematic method to collect and visualize community members' knowledge and create a shared understanding to take action. Community members brainstormed, sorted, and rated their responses to the prompt: \"What in your environment is affecting your and your community's health?\" Responses were analyzed and visually depicted by concept maps consisting of separate but interrelated clusters of ideas. Community members discussed and validated the maps, selecting a final map illustrating their community's exposome.\nRESULTS: A total of 118 community members completed concept mapping. On average communities identified 7 clusters to define their exposome. The resulting concept maps offer a community definition of the exposome. Five major themes arose across all four communities: conventional environmental concerns, built environment, social relationships, crime and safety, and individual health and behaviors.\nDISCUSSION: The resulting community-exposome definition demonstrates the importance of expanding the scope of exposures beyond traditional environmental influences to include the lived experience of individuals and communities. While newer exposome definitions align more closely with this community definition, traditional exposome methods do not routinely include these factors. To truly capture the totality of lifetime exposures and improve human health, researchers should incorporate community perspectives into exposome research.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34465170": "Human health is regulated by complex interactions among the genome, the microbiome, and the environment. While extensive research has been conducted on the human genome and microbiome, little is known about the human exposome.

Traditional environmental and biological monitoring only targets specific substances, whereas exposomic approaches identify and quantify thousands of substances simultaneously using nontargeted high-throughput and high-resolution analyses. The quantified self (QS) aims at enhancing our understanding of human health and disease through self-tracking.

An exposome includes general external influences such as pollution and weather; external individual-specific factors (diet, infections, self-selected chemical intake); and internal individual-specific constituents (metabolic byproducts, microbiome derivatives, inflammatory mediators, stress hormones, etc). The exposome paradigm is inherent in animal toxicity testing because laboratory studies are designed so that subjects share a common exposure history encompassing not only exposure(s)/treatment(s) but also other chemical sources (eg, air, bedding, food, water). Toxicologic pathologists should remember that some differences in responsiveness to a test article may reflect subtle differences in individual exposomes of seemingly equivalent test animals. Translation of toxicity data obtained in tests of genetically inbred animals maintained under controlled environmental conditions to produce quasi-identical exposomes at best offers only approximate guidance regarding potential responses in genetically heterogeneous human populations who live in many environmental settings and thus have divergent, complex exposomes.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37979229": "In 2005, Christopher P.

The exposome concept also aimed at to completing the genome, that describes the genetic predisposition as a determinant of disease and death as well as potential targets of intervention. The exposome can be subdivided into multiple pollutomes related to specific chemical and physical pollutants (or other forms of environmental risks), periods of life (infancy, childhood, adolescence, adulthood, and old age) or geographical locations. While exposome research and, in general, health research of the last decades has predominantly focused on what factors contribute to and initiate morbidity and mortality, little is done on factors that will help to develop, maintain, or even increase human health. We want to contribute to this reorientation by supporting and implementing the beneficial exposome, comprising all environmental exposures with the potential to promote health.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37229681": "The exposome concept arises from the need to integrate different disciplines of public health and environmental sciences, mainly including environmental epidemiology, exposure science, and toxicology. The role of the exposome is to understand how the totality of an individual's exposures throughout the lifetime can impact human health. The etiology of a health condition is rarely explained by a single exposure. Therefore, examining the human exposome as a whole becomes relevant to simultaneously consider multiple risk factors and more accurately estimate concurrent causes of different health outcomes. Generally, the exposome is explained through three domains: general external exposome, specific external exposome, and internal exposome. The general external exposome includes measurable population-level exposures such as air pollution or meteorological factors. The specific external exposome includes information on individual exposures, such as lifestyle factors, typically obtained from questionnaires. Meanwhile, the internal exposome encompasses multiple biological responses to external factors, detected through molecular and omics analyses. Additionally, in recent decades, the socio-exposome theory has emerged, where all exposures are studied as a phenomenon dependent on the interaction between socioeconomic factors that vary depending on the context, allowing the identification of mechanisms that lead to health inequalities. The considerable production of data in exposome studies has led researchers to face new methodological and statistical challenges, introducing various approaches to estimate the effect of the exposome on health. Among the most common are regression models (Exposome-Wide Association Study - ExWAS), dimensionality reduction and exposure grouping techniques, and machine learning methods. The significant conceptual and methodological innovation of the exposome for a more holistic evaluation of the risks associated with human health is continuously expanding and will require further investigations related to the application of information obtained from studies into prevention and public health policies.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22136338": "Genetic factors are believed to play an important role in the etiology of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). Discordant findings for monozygotic (MZ) twins with AIS show that environmental factors including different intrauterine environments are important in etiology, but what these environmental factors may be is unknown. Recent evidence for common chronic non-communicable diseases suggests epigenetic differences may underlie MZ twin discordance, and be the link between environmental factors and phenotypic differences. DNA methylation is one important epigenetic mechanism operating at the interface between genome and environment to regulate phenotypic plasticity with a complex regulation across the genome during the first decade of life. The word exposome refers to the totality of environmental exposures from conception onwards, comprising factors in external and internal environments. The word exposome is used here also in relation to physiologic and etiopathogenetic factors that affect normal spinal growth and may induce the deformity of AIS. In normal postnatal spinal growth we propose a new term and concept, physiologic growth-plate exposome for the normal processes particularly of the internal environments that may have epigenetic effects on growth plates of vertebrae. In AIS, we propose a new term and concept pathophysiologic scoliogenic exposome for the abnormal processes in molecular pathways particularly of the internal environment currently expressed as etiopathogenetic hypotheses; these are suggested to have deforming effects on the growth plates of vertebrae at cell, tissue, structure and/or organ levels that are considered to be epigenetic. New research is required for chromatin modifications including DNA methylation in AIS subjects and vertebral growth plates excised at surgery. In addition, consideration is needed for a possible network approach to etiopathogenesis by constructing AIS diseasomes. These approaches may lead through screening, genetic, epigenetic, biochemical, metabolic phenotypes and pharmacogenomic research to identify susceptible individuals at risk and modulate abnormal molecular pathways of AIS. The potential of epigenetic-based medical therapy for AIS cannot be assessed at present, and must await new research derived from the evaluation of epigenetic concepts of spinal growth in health and deformity.

To increase the feasibility and efficiency, we propose that (1) an exposomic study can start with health events during critical-window periods; (2) both data- and hypothesis-driven exposomics should be combined to prioritize the risk of environmental factors; and (3) reliable statistical analysis of high-dimensional data of external and internal exposure factors are urgently needed.

Considering the complexity of exposures and, in addition, the reactions of the body to exposures - i.e., the exposome - reverses classical exposure science where the precise measurement of single or few exposures is associated with specific health or environmental effects. The complete description of an individual's exposome is impossible; even less so is that of a population. We can, however, cast a wider net by foregoing some rigor in assessment and compensating with the statistical power of rich datasets. The advent of omics technologies enables a relatively cheap, high-content description of the biological effects of substances, especially in tissues and biofluids. They can be combined with many other rich data-streams, creating big data of exposure and effect. Computational methods increasingly allow data integration, discerning the signal from the noise and formulating hypotheses of exposure-effect relationships. These can be followed up in a targeted way. With a better exposure element in the risk equation, exposomics - new kid on the block of risk assessment - promises to identify novel exposure (interactions) and health/environment effect associations. This may also create opportunities to prioritize the more relevant chemicals for risk assessment, thereby lowering the burden on hazard assessment in an expo-sure-driven approach.

The exposome has been proposed to complement the genome and be the totality of all environmental exposures of an individual over his or her lifetime. However, if measurements of the exposome in biological samples are the sole tool for exposure assessment there are a number of limitations. First, it has limited utility for fully capturing the impact of complex mixtures such environmental tobacco smoke or particulate matter air pollution. Second, a number of relevant environmental exposures such as noise, heat or electromagnetic fields do not have direct correlates as metabolites or protein adducts, but there is important evidence linking them with health effects. Third, functional genomic changes are likely in many instances to be both a susceptibility factor and a marker of internal doses in response to environmental exposures. Fourth, internal dose measurements of environmental exposures might have lost the distinct signature of the relevant sources. This paper emphasises the obligation of environmental epidemiology to provide robust evidence to assist timely and sufficient protection of vulnerable subgroups of populations from environmental hazards.

Many believe that nurture has an even greater role than genetics in determining lifelong success, health, and well-being.

Our aim was to highlight the most recent technological advancements for measurement of the exposome, bioinformatics development, current limitations, and future needs in environmental health. In the discussions, an emphasis was placed on moving away from a one-chemical one-health outcome model toward a new paradigm of monitoring the totality of exposures that individuals may experience over their lifetime. This is critical to better understand the underlying biological impact on human health, particularly during windows of susceptibility. Recent advancements in metabolomics and bioinformatics are driving the field forward in biomonitoring and understanding the biological impact, and the technological and logistical challenges involved in the analyses were highlighted.

The combination of these changes and the external signals that cause them constitute an individual's exposome, which is constantly changing and expanding throughout life. Thus, measuring the exposome requires specific tools and approaches as well as a global perspective. RA, a complex, heterogeneous, pro-inflammatory autoimmune disease with a genetic component and for which a large number of environmental factors have already been incriminated is an appropriate field of application for the exposome. The aim of this review is to define the exposome concept, outline the different analytic tools available for its study and finally apply them to the field of RA.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35310334": "The exposome concept encourages holistic consideration of the non-genetic factors (environmental exposures including lifestyle) that influence an individual's health over their life course. However, disconnect between the concept and practical application has promoted divergent interpretations of the exposome across disciplines and reinforced separation of the environmental (emphasizing exposures) and biological (emphasizing responses) research communities. In particular, while knowledge of biological responses can help to distinguish actual (i.e. experienced) from potential exposures, the inclusion of endogenous processes has generated confusion about the position of the exposome in a multi-omics systems biology context. We propose a reattribution of \"exposome\" to exclusively represent the totality of contact with external factors that a biological entity experiences, and introduce the term \"functional exposomics\" to denote the systematic study of exposure-phenotype interaction. This reoriented definition of the exposome allows a more readily integrable dataset for multi-omics and systems biology research.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36436753": "The exposome is the cumulative measure of environmental influences and associated biological responses throughout the lifespan, including those from the environment, diet, behaviour, and endogenous processes. The exposome concept and the 2030 Agenda for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) from the United Nations are the basis for understanding the aetiology and consequences of non-communicable diseases, including gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Pregnancy may be developed in an environment with adverse factors part of the immediate internal medium for fetus development and the external medium to which the pregnant woman is exposed. The placenta is the interface between maternal and fetal compartments and acts as a protective barrier or easing agent to transfer exposome from mother to fetus. Under and over-nutrition in utero, exposure to adverse environmental pollutants such as heavy metals, endocrine-disrupting chemicals, pesticides, drugs, pharmaceuticals, lifestyle, air pollutants, and tobacco smoke plays a determinant role in the development of GDM. This phenomenon is worsened by metabolic stress postnatally, such as obesity which increases the risk of GDM and other diseases. Clinical risk factors for GDM development include its aetiology. It is proposed that knowledge-based interventions to change the potential interdependent ecto-exposome and endo-exposome could avoid the occurrence and consequences of GDM.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34792619": "Type 2 diabetes is one of the major chronic diseases accounting for a substantial proportion of disease burden in Western countries. The majority of the burden of type 2 diabetes is attributed to environmental risks and modifiable risk factors such as lifestyle. The environment we live in, and changes to it, can thus contribute substantially to the prevention of type 2 diabetes at a population level. The 'exposome' represents the (measurable) totality of environmental, i.e. nongenetic, drivers of health and disease. The external exposome comprises aspects of the built environment, the social environment, the physico-chemical environment and the lifestyle/food environment. The internal exposome comprises measurements at the epigenetic, transcript, proteome, microbiome or metabolome level to study either the exposures directly, the imprints these exposures leave in the biological system, the potential of the body to combat environmental insults and/or the biology itself. In this review, we describe the evidence for environmental risk factors of type 2 diabetes, focusing on both the general external exposome and imprints of this on the internal exposome. Studies provided established associations of air pollution, residential noise and area-level socioeconomic deprivation with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, while neighbourhood walkability and green space are consistently associated with a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes. There is little or inconsistent evidence on the contribution of the food environment, other aspects of the social environment and outdoor temperature. These environmental factors are thought to affect type 2 diabetes risk mainly through mechanisms incorporating lifestyle factors such as physical activity or diet, the microbiome, inflammation or chronic stress. To further assess causality of these associations, future studies should focus on investigating the longitudinal effects of our environment (and changes to it) in relation to type 2 diabetes risk and whether these associations are explained by these proposed mechanisms.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28125387": "Investigating a single environmental exposure in isolation does not reflect the actual human exposure circumstance nor does it capture the multifactorial etiology of health and disease. The exposome, defined as the totality of environmental exposures from conception onward, may advance our understanding of environmental contributors to disease by more fully assessing the multitude of human exposures across the life course. Implementation into studies of human health has been limited, in part owing to theoretical and practical challenges including a lack of infrastructure to support comprehensive exposure assessment, difficulty in differentiating physiologic variation from environmentally induced changes, and the need for study designs and analytic methods that accommodate specific aspects of the exposome, such as high-dimensional exposure data and multiple windows of susceptibility. Recommendations for greater data sharing and coordination, methods development, and acknowledgment and minimization of multiple types of measurement error are offered to encourage researchers to embark on exposome research to promote the environmental health and well-being of all populations.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30772495": "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a systemic inflammatory autoimmune disease characterized by a broad spectrum of clinical and serological manifestations. This may reflect a complex and multifactorial etiology involving several identified genetic and environmental factors, though not explaining the full risk of SLE. Established SLE risk genotypes are either very rare or with modest effect sizes and twin studies indicate that other factors besides genetics must be operative in SLE etiology. The exposome comprises the cumulative environmental influences on an individual and associated biological responses through the lifespan. It has been demonstrated that exposure to silica, smoking and exogenous hormones candidate as environmental risk factors in SLE, while alcohol consumption seems to be protective. Very few studies have investigated potential gene-environment interactions to determine if some of the unexplained SLE risk is attributable hereto. Even less have focused on interactions between specific risk genotypes and environmental exposures relevant to SLE pathogenesis. Cohort and case-control studies may provide data to suggest such biological interactions and various statistical measures of interaction can indicate the magnitude of such. However, such studies do often have very large sample-size requirements and we suggest that the rarity of SLE to some extent can be compensated by increasing the ratio of controls. This review summarizes the current body of knowledge on gene-environment interactions in SLE. We argue for the prioritization of studies that comprise the increasing details available of the genome and exposome relevant to SLE as they have the potential to disclose new aspects of SLE pathogenesis including phenotype heterogeneity.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35108405": "Environmental exposure plays a major role in the development of allergic diseases. The exposome can be classified into internal (e.g., aging, hormones, and metabolic processes), specific external (e.g., chemical pollutants or lifestyle factors), and general external (e.g., broader socioeconomic and psychological contexts) domains, all of which are interrelated. All the factors we are exposed to, from the moment of conception to death, are part of the external exposome. Several hundreds of thousands of new chemicals have been introduced in modern life without our having a full understanding of their toxic health effects and ways to mitigate these effects. Climate change, air pollution, microplastics, tobacco smoke, changes and loss of biodiversity, alterations in dietary habits, and the microbiome due to modernization, urbanization, and globalization constitute our surrounding environment and external exposome. Some of these factors disrupt the epithelial barriers of the skin and mucosal surfaces, and these disruptions have been linked in the last few decades to the increasing prevalence and severity of allergic and inflammatory diseases such as atopic dermatitis, food allergy, allergic rhinitis, chronic rhinosinusitis, eosinophilic esophagitis, and asthma. The epithelial barrier hypothesis provides a mechanistic explanation of how these factors can explain the rapid increase in allergic and autoimmune diseases. In this review, we discuss factors affecting the planet's health in the context of the 'epithelial barrier hypothesis,' including climate change, pollution, changes and loss of biodiversity, and emphasize the changes in the external exposome in the last few decades and their effects on allergic diseases. In addition, the roles of increased dietary fatty acid consumption and environmental substances (detergents, airborne pollen, ozone, microplastics, nanoparticles, and tobacco) affecting epithelial barriers are discussed. Considering the emerging data from recent studies, we suggest stringent governmental regulations, global policy adjustments, patient education, and the establishment of individualized control measures to mitigate environmental threats and decrease allergic disease.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28494538": "It is widely accepted that a relatively small proportion of chronic disease can be explained by genetic factors alone. Although information about environmental exposure is important to comprehensively evaluate chronic diseases, this information is not sufficiently or accurately assessed by comparison with genomic factors. To emphasize the importance of more complete evaluation of environmental exposure, the concept of the exposome, which indicates the entirety of environmental exposure from conception onwards, was introduced in 2005. Since the 2010s several epidemiological studies, such as the Human Early-Life Exposome project, have applied the exposome concept. The exposome consists of three overlapping domains: the general external, the specific external, and the internal environments. General external factors include the broader socioeconomic environment, and specific external factors include lifestyles, occupations, and pollutant exposures. Internal factors include biological effects and responses. Because the exposome covers exposures from conception to death, the birth cohort is an important part of the exposome study. Although there is not yet an established consensus in selecting what, when, and where to measure concerning the exposome, the use of omics analyses, especially analysis of the metabolome, should be considered in order to implement the exposome concept in the birth cohort. The exposome needs to be measured repeatedly in certain important phases of life, such as during pregnancy and infancy. To perform exposome-informed epidemiological studies, untargeted data-driven approaches in conjunction with dimension reduction techniques need to be developed and refined. The exposome concept has the potential to make a breakthrough in overcoming some of the limitations of conventional epidemiology. Concerted national and international efforts are required for future exposome studies.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21081972": "During the 1920s, the forerunners of exposure science collaborated with health professionals to investigate the causes of occupational diseases. With the birth of U.S. regulatory agencies in the 1970s, interest in the environmental origins of human diseases waned, and exposure scientists focused instead upon levels of selected contaminants in air and water. In fact, toxic chemicals enter the body not only from exogenous sources (air, water, diet, drugs, and radiation) but also from endogenous processes, including inflammation, lipid peroxidation, oxidative stress, existing diseases, infections, and gut flora. Thus, even though current evidence suggests that non-genetic factors contribute about 90% of the risks of chronic diseases, we have not explored the vast majority of human exposures that might initiate disease processes. The concept of the exposome, representing the totality of exposures received by a person during life, encompasses all sources of toxicants and, therefore, offers scientists an agnostic approach for investigating the environmental causes of chronic diseases. In this context, it is appropriate to regard the \"environment\" as the body's internal chemical environment and to define \"exposures\" as levels of biologically active chemicals in this internal environment. To explore the exposome, it makes sense to employ a top-down approach based upon biomonitoring (e.g. blood sampling) rather than a bottom-up approach that samples air, water, food, and so on. Because sources and levels of exposure change over time, exposomes can be constructed by analyzing toxicants in blood specimens obtained during critical stages of life. Initial investigations could use archived blood from prospective cohort studies to measure important classes of toxic chemicals, notably, reactive electrophiles, metals, metabolic products, hormone-like substances, and persistent organic compounds. The exposome offers health scientists an avenue for integrating research that is currently fractured along lines related to particular diseases and risk factors, and can thereby promote discovery of the key exposures responsible for chronic diseases. By embracing the exposome as its operational paradigm, exposure science can play a major role in discovering and mitigating these exposures.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32221742": "The exposome represents the totality of life course environmental exposures (including lifestyle and other non-genetic factors), from the prenatal period onwards. This holistic concept of exposure provides a new framework to advance the understanding of complex and multifactorial diseases. Prospective pregnancy and birth cohort studies provide a unique opportunity for exposome research as they are able to capture, from prenatal life onwards, both the external (including lifestyle, chemical, social and wider community-level exposures) and the internal (including inflammation, metabolism, epigenetics, and gut microbiota) domains of the exposome. In this paper, we describe the steps required for applying an exposome approach, describe the main strengths and limitations of different statistical approaches and discuss their challenges, with the aim to provide guidance for methodological choices in the analysis of exposome data in birth cohort studies. An exposome approach implies selecting, pre-processing, describing and analyzing a large set of exposures. Several statistical methods are currently available to assess exposome-health associations, which differ in terms of research question that can be answered, of balance between sensitivity and false discovery proportion, and between computational complexity and simplicity (parsimony). Assessing the association between many exposures and health still raises many exposure assessment issues and statistical challenges. The exposome favors a holistic approach of environmental influences on health, which is likely to allow a more complete understanding of disease etiology.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/38058436": "The \"exposome\" covers all disease determinants across a lifetime. Many exposome factors could induce epigenetic changes, especially in DNA methylation. Yet, the role of these modifications in disease development remains partly understood. Although the possible relationship among the exposome factors, epigenetic modifications, and health/disease has been investigated extensively, all previous studies start from the assumption that epigenetic changes are always detrimental to (or represent an adverse effect on) the health of the affected individual. We hereby propose a new approach to investigate these modifications, and their possible relation with human health, in the context of the exposome. Our hypothesis is based on the possibility that some environmentally-induced changes are plastic entities, responding physiologically to the environment to allow individual adaptation. Briefly, after evaluating the association between environmental exposure and the variation of a given biological parameter through regression models, we use the estimated regression function to predict values for each study subject. We then calculated the relative percent difference (PD) between the measured (i.e., observed) biological parameter and the predicted (i.e., expected) from the model. Notably, we have tested our hypothesis using two distinct models, specifically focusing on LINE-1 methylation and extracellular vesicles (EVs). We hypothesize that the greater the difference between the observed and the expected, the greater the inability of the subject to adapt to external stimuli.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26231368": "The exposome concept takes a holistic approach facilitated by new and emerging technologies to describe 'the totality of human environmental (i.e. non-genetic) exposures from conception onwards, complementing the genome'. It provides a framework to advance the environmental epidemiology field that has until now focused almost exclusively on single-exposure health effects. The exposome includes an external domain, measured by methods including geo-spatial modelling, questionnaire and biomonitoring of external exposures while the internal domain is commonly assessed through molecular omics platforms. The internal domain, in part, reflects the biological response to the external domain. New statistical frameworks are required to integrate and assess exposome-health effects. The pregnancy period is a key starting point to describe the dynamic exposome, due to its heightened sensitivity and potential lifetime impact. A handful of studies have started to move towards an exposome approach in assessing the effects of the multiple exposures during pregnancy on child development.

However, the complexity of the environment, involving many causal and noncausal pathways, makes research extremely challenging. To tackle these challenges, we have recently proposed the use of the exposome paradigm. The exposome represents the totality of exposures in a lifetime from conception onward. The framework offers a solution to handle the complexity of all \"non-genetic\" factors. The exposome approach has recently been adopted to construct an exposome score for schizophrenia (ES-SCZ). Findings demonstrate that ES-SCZ can be used for risk stratification, adjusting for cumulative environmental load in statistical testing, and collecting risk enriched cohorts. Increasing data availability will help improve ES-SCZ that can be used in staging models to enhance clinical characterization and outcome forecasting. Although an ES-SCZ already provides several practical benefits for research practice, the exposome paradigm offers much more. Agnostic exposure-wide analyses might be the first step to mapping the exposome of mental disorders. These analyses help distinguish genuine signals from selective reporting and uncover novel risk and resilience factors. The exposome approach will also increase our understanding of the differential impact of the environment on mental health across geographical settings and ethnic communities.

These distinctive characteristics lead to multiple unique methodological challenges across different stages of a study. This article provides a review of the existing resources, methods, and tools in the new and developing field for spatial and contextual exposome-health studies focusing on four areas: (1) data engineering, (2) spatiotemporal data linkage, (3) statistical methods for exposome-health association studies, and (4) machine- and deep-learning methods to use spatial and contextual exposome data for disease prediction.

The sum of external factors that an individual is exposed to throughout their lifetime is termed the exposome. The exposome spans multiple domains from population to molecular levels and, in combination with genetic factors, holds the key to understanding the phenotypic diversity seen in AD patients. Exposomal domains are categorized into nonspecific (human and natural factors affecting populations), specific (eg humidity, ultraviolet radiation, diet, pollution, allergens, water hardness) and internal (cutaneous and gut microbiota and host cell interaction) exposures. The skin, as the organ that most directly interacts with and adapts to the external environment, is a prime target for exploration of exposomal influences on disease. Given the well-recognized physical environmental influences on AD, this condition could be much better understood through insightful exposomal research. In this narrative review, we examine each domain in turn, highlighting current understanding of the mechanisms by which exposomal influences modulate AD pathogenesis at distinct points in time.

Humans are exposed to many different chemicals, which can pose a major threat to the well-being of humanity. Targeted or non-targeted mass spectrometry techniques are widely used to identify and characterize various environmental stressors when linking exposures to human health. However, identification remains challenging due to the huge chemical space applicable to exposomics, combined with the lack of sufficient relevant entries in spectral libraries. Addressing these challenges requires cheminformatics tools and database resources to share curated open spectral data on chemicals to improve the identification of chemicals in exposomics studies. This article describes efforts to contribute spectra relevant for exposomics to the open mass spectral library MassBank (https://www.massbank.eu) using various open source software efforts, including the R packages RMassBank and Shinyscreen. The experimental spectra were obtained from ten mixtures containing toxicologically relevant chemicals from the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Non-Targeted Analysis Collaborative Trial (ENTACT). Following processing and curation, 5582 spectra from 783 of the 1268 ENTACT compounds were added to MassBank, and through this to other open spectral libraries (e.g., MoNA, GNPS) for community benefit. Additionally, an automated deposition and annotation workflow was developed with PubChem to enable the display of all MassBank mass spectra in PubChem, which is rerun with each MassBank release.

Top-down strategies are required to assess something this comprehensive, and could transform our understanding of how environmental factors affect human health. Metabolic profiling (metabonomics/metabolomics) defines an individual's metabolic phenotype, which is influenced by genotype, diet, lifestyle, health and xenobiotic exposure, and could also reveal intermediate biomarkers for disease risk that reflect adaptive response to exposure. We investigated changes in metabolism in volunteers living near a point source of environmental pollution: a closed zinc smelter with associated elevated levels of environmental cadmium.\nMETHODS: High-resolution \u00b9H NMR spectroscopy (metabonomics) was used to acquire urinary metabolic profiles from 178 human volunteers. The spectral data were subjected to multivariate and univariate analysis to identify metabolites that were correlated with lifestyle or biological factors. Urinary levels of 8-oxo-deoxyguanosine were also measured, using mass spectrometry, as a marker of systemic oxidative stress.\nRESULTS: Six urinary metabolites, either associated with mitochondrial metabolism (citrate, 3-hydroxyisovalerate, 4-deoxy-erythronic acid) or one-carbon metabolism (dimethylglycine, creatinine, creatine), were associated with cadmium exposure. In particular, citrate levels retained a significant correlation to urinary cadmium and smoking status after controlling for age and sex. Oxidative stress (as determined by urinary 8-oxo-deoxyguanosine levels) was elevated in individuals with high cadmium exposure, supporting the hypothesis that heavy metal accumulation was causing mitochondrial dysfunction.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study shows evidence that an NMR-based metabolic profiling study in an uncontrolled human population is capable of identifying intermediate biomarkers of response to toxicants at true environmental concentrations, paving the way for exposome research.", "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22199396": "Although chronic diseases are primarily environmental (ie, not genetic) in origin, the particular environmental causes of these diseases are poorly understood. A WHO study of worldwide cancer mortality identified nine diverse environmental factors, including pollution, diet, lifestyle factors and infections. However, the joint effect of these nine factors accounted for only about one-third of cancer mortality, indicating that about two-thirds are of unknown aetiology. One problem relates to the community of epidemiologists, which sorts environmental factors into marginally overlapping domains, thereby creating gaps in coverage. Also, information about environmental exposures in epidemiologic studies is generally derived from questionnaires that are ill suited for assessing thousands of potentially causative exposures. Finally, the few studies that rigorously estimate exposure levels focus upon a handful of pollutants of regulatory importance and thus are unsuited for finding hitherto unrecognised exposures from both exogenous and endogenous sources. The concept of the 'exposome'-representing the totality of exposures from gestation onwards-has recently been introduced as a complement to the genome in studies of disease aetiology. The exposome concept promotes environmental analogues of genome-wide association studies, which employ untargeted omic methods to compare biospecimens from diseased and healthy subjects.

The primary endpoint was change from baseline in percent predicted forced vital capacity (ppFVC). Secondary endpoints included other pulmonary function tests, upper limb function and strength assessments, and changes in upper arm fat and fibrosis scores on magnetic resonance imaging.\nRESULTS: Fifteen patients completed the trial. Annual change from baseline (SE) in ppFVC was -4.2 (0.7) (95% CI -5.5, -2.8). Rate of decline in ppFVC in pamrevlumab-treated patients was slower than observed in historical published trials of non-ambulatory patients. MISSION participants experienced slower-than-anticipated muscle function declines compared with natural history and historical published trials of non-ambulatory patients with DMD. Pamrevlumab was well-tolerated.

Studies on both humans and animals have shown evidence that CS is a crucial factor in AD. The brains of AD patients have been found to have senescent glial cells and neurons, and removal of these senescent cells results in a decrease in Amyloid beta plaque and Neurofibrillary tangles, along with improved cognitive functions.
